startrek,"Hello there! So bit of background. For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).


Anyway, given the current quarantine has left me with extra time, I would love to branch out and explore Star Trek. I remember for a short bit in middle school I was into TNG and did like it and have seen JJ's movies.

startrek,"Rewatching DS9 season six with a friend who has never seen DS9 before.  First, I love vicariously re-living my first watching through my friend.  It's such a job.  We just came to the episode Sacrifice of Angels and he commented how anti-climactic the scene was where the prophets eliminate the Dominion fleet and I recalled that I thought the same way when the episode was aired years and years ago.  He asked me: ""what happened to them?"" And ""oh wait, don't tell me, I guess we'll find out in a future episode.""  I told him, ""nah.  That's it, the god-like Prophets wiped them out,"" and he replied ""oh.""    


Maybe it would have been better to show the wormhole energies going nuts and then slicing through and destroying the Dominion ships.  Something more definitive.  I know it would have been expensive in an already expensive ep, but it would have been more...satisfying?",Rewatching Season 6 DS9 (spoilers)
startrek,"It cost $70,000 per episode of TNG to remaster. This was almost ten years ago. They have made a ton of money with rerun TV deals and much more with streaming. This is cost effective, since HD is more preferable and has an easier sell through. With inflation, and more needed CGI needed let's say each episode of DS9 would now cost $200,000.

That's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).

Even Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.

Then there's CBS all access, who is now paying a lot of money for new Star Trek content with partner deals (Disco, Netflix, and Picard, Amazon). Even they could afford this to entice new subscribers. Something that didn't exist before when it was only a physical disk market and the Blu-rays were sold for far too high a price. 

The lower bar to entry the more money made. They would have made more money with the Blu-rays at a lower price. The lower bar now is definitely streaming. There was complaint that the Blu-rays didn't sell enough, what they didn't say is how well they did with the TV syndication deals, and the HD Netflix, Amazon deals. 

This is possible, and once done will make the studio money for the next 50 years.","Yes, Deep Space Nine Could and Should get Remastered"

startrek,Back in the 90s I started Voyager a little before Kes left and watched it to the end. I never watched the first few seasons. Yesterday I decided to start Voyager from the beginning and boy am I enjoying this. I loved Janeway before but damn I love her so much more now. I know the ending and how things go their but to finally have the foundation is really enjoyable . I know Voyager gets allot of hate and I don’t disagree with it but I still enjoy it. All the actors are great in Season 1. Tom Paris telling Chakotay to turn into a bird and fly away is laughable in the worst possible way . Neelix is ridiculous as he always has been. The doctor is awesome. I’m so enjoying this.,I’m really enjoying rewatching Voyager
startrek,"Being slightly provocative, but generally I think it is true.  


The original series was shot in the 60's. Of course it looks antiquated and that Kirk is a bit misogynistic, but when you compare it to other shows at the time it was streets ahead. I'm also amazed at how much of a difference the re-mastered version makes!  


I like TNG, but there is this fable about it that it was all good. For me, I think the first 2 seasons were awfully nd it got better in season 3. It wasn't until season 4 that it gets really good.  


DS9, of the TNG/DS/Voy era is my favourite. The Federation is now not so squeaky clean and perfect like they are in TNG. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the positive outlook for Humanity. In fact, I love it. However, I'm not so naive to think that Humanity will be wonderful in another 300 years. We'll still have our issues, and DS9 is good at showing that.  


Voyager, an attempt together back to the travelling spaceship but have a different look &amp; feel. Just too many annoying characters (Yes I'm looking at you Neelix.. at least Wesley grew out of being annoying!). I'm certainly enjoying it more than I did the first time and it does have some of my favourite characters in it (The Dr, 7 of 9).

Enterprise. I feel so sorry for it. If you look at it really, it was good right out of the door. I reckon if they'd got their full 7 seasons it would now be regarded as one of the best Trek's. I like the premise of Humanity really first getting out there. Sure, I know that T'Pol was brought in to be eye candy for the guys, but she does a brilliant Vulcan! I actually like the whole Crew.

Discovery. How can people not watch it, or only watch 2 seasons and say it is awful? Think of the first 2 seasons of TNG for god's sake! I love Discovery. I think they've done a great job at a difficult time period. I think the guest captains (Lorca, Pike) were also great! I can do the suspension of belief about the Klingons too. Why does everyone give this a hard time, when they ignore the difference in the Klingons between TOS and ST:The Movie? Sure, it's not episodic. So what? That's not how TV is watched now (I""m binge watching Voyager at the moment). I love that you watch the season, see the ends nd then watch it again and get some of the subtleties you missed the first time around.

Picard: TNG 3.0 (TNG 2.0 was the movies). I like it. Again, not episodic. Funnily enough though, Whilst Picard is the glue, I'm enjoying the other characters more. I forget his name, but the Roman Samurai needs to be fleshed out more and I hope we see more of him, but everyone else is great! I really didn't like the Riker to the rescue though. Why would they put a reserve captain in charge of an entire squadron? Stupid! He'd done his cameo, wasn't necessary.  


TAS: I missed that. I've always had problems with it, but I suspect I'll find it interesting now... going off how I'm disliking Voyager less. Also because nuances of TAS have crept into Discovery. I'd love to see this redone in CGI.  


All in all, we are damn lucky we aren't Star Wars fans, although I do watch it, we have great TV to watch. Some of the best ever made and for a 50 years old TV program to stand the test of time is amazing!  


I say don't judge them... just enjoy them for what they are..... bloody brilliant TV (&amp; Some really great movies).",I think it's dumb to compare the various shows
startrek,"I grew up in a household that loved Star Wars and Star Trek. In fact, my dad probably consistently watched more Trek than Star Wars, but we talked more about Star Wars and were more excited for those movies. He was more of a fan of the movies than the shows too.

I personally like Star Wars more, and I recognize that both fans are super finicky. However, I've noticed that Trekkies are far more intolerant of anything new with Trek than Star Wars fans are with Star Wars.
Maybe since Trek is more niche...?

Despite Last Jedi nonsense, Star Wars fans have been more connected.
I am wondering why both can't just accept anything new and different. The same sucks. You have the original, so love that and try to embrace the new.

I just started watching Voyager last night and it was something I never thought I'd do cause I thought it looked dumb, but I am actually really loving it more so than other Trek stuff.

startrek,"I've been binge watching Voyager for the first time since it was released, because my memory of it was so bad. Having said that, I've seen some really good episodes. However, season 5 so far is generally quite good.

S5E6 ""Timeless"". The first major breaking of the temporal directive by members of the voyager crew. Really good episodes. Interesting when you see half of sevens cranium. However, the whole episode is excellent. Interesting Captain La Forge.... yet he isn't a Captain in the prequels for Picard (Comics/Books). yes I know it is a different time line.

S5E7 ""Infinite Regress"". Great story. Basically Borg schizophrenia. Some amazing acting from Jerry Ryan. Especially when she changes personalities. The switch is just stunning at times. Also an interesting story line in that she's seeing people whom she has assimilated.

S5E8 ""Nothing Human"". The creature that attaches itself to B'Elanna is absolutely crap. However, the whole story on the morality of using medical research based on, at beast, questionable techniques is superb.

S5E11""Latent Image"". AN interesting ethical dilemma that they resolve in the end, but what I really loved about this episode is it is again an extension of the Dr where he ceases to be less machine and more a sentient life form. He actually talks about the algorithms he has to help him make decisions, and in this case he is given a no-win situation where he has to make a choice, and then how doe she deal with it.

startrek,"I've never fully understood the scene of the Enterprise leaving spacedock in Star Trek II.

Ok, I understand that Spock wants to show Kirk that Saavik is capable of commanding the Enterprise after the Kobayashi Maru failure (not failure). But she's not actually piloting the Enterprise, Sulu is. And therefore there's no reason for Kirk of McCoy to be on edge. Even if Saavik had give the wrong command, Sulu wouldn't have crashed the Enterprise. And the only two commands she gives (that we can hear) are ""aft thrusters Mr Sulu...

startrek,"I really enjoyed Star Trek: Picard and while personally I feel it's a show we can judge ""Pre-Nepenthe"" and ""Post-Nepenthe"" (meaning it was an okay show up till Nepenthe and then it became a great show) the ending has made a lot of people consider if it was really the way things were meant to end. 

I've had this conversation with a lot of friends since the Picard finale and I have agree, it feels like there was a different ending planned and many people think the whole android body thing was a cop out.

Was the original plan right up till the end for Picard to die and not be resurrected but that plan got sidelined when Pat Stewart decided he was having fun and wanted to do season 2?

There's really absolutely no reason to do the android body thing--- what does it get them? It's not like Stewart was playing a significantly older character and with an android body he could now play his own age and jump around. It's not like people would have questioned Picard still adventuring at his age and 24th century medicine keeping him going. 

I've had numerous people say to me this was a cop out and a way to kill Picard but not really kill him so they can do season 2.  Rewatching Nepenthe and Post-Nepenthe I have to agree.

All onscreen deaths count as people who die on screen(pretty self explanatory). So during the chase, Picard’s mentor would count as an onscreen death, or the Yellow shirt who gets killed during Descent would also count. However, ship destruction and causality reports won’t count. So things like the Yamato being destroyed and the destruction of Romulus don’t count. People dying off screen I may count if they are important. Such as during lower decks when that Bajoran lady dies offscreen.

startrek,"I’ll admit that the color divisions for Federation officers has always puzzled me. Especially because they change so often. 
And, although Deanna did not wear traditional Starfleet clothing for the better part of her appearance, whenever she does it, she wears blue.

Anyways, as far as I’m concerned (in TNG and subsequent) the color blue is associated with Medical/Science, yellow is Security/Engineering and red is... Well... Red... I think that red regards to command, but I’m not so sure because of Wesley, Geordi and Worf wearing those colors when they belong on Security or Engineering even at lower ranking. I guess in both Geordi and Wesley’s case they wore red because they were often found on ships’s helm. 
In any case... Feel free to explain it to me since I clearly can’t understand on my own. 

Now to Deanna. As ship’s counselor, I would assume her rank is not only more related to commanding the ship as it is a pretty high one at that. I would assume she would wear red as well. Heck, I could even make more of a case for yellow than blue. Why blue? If it’s in regard to her position as almost a psychiatrist to the ship then it makes sense because it would be Medical, but she helps command the ship more then she helps the crew...

I’m ok with out-of-universe explanations like: “Marina Sirtis just liked blue better” as far as I know the whole red and yellow swap in between series happened because of reasons like that. But I wonder if there is an explanation in the lore for her wearing blue...

startrek,"I just started watching the show. “Enterprise” puts in so much more effort into its alien cultures than other Trek shows. I don’t know if this continues to be the case, but 10 episodes in, I’ve really been enjoying how much world building this show gets done. The alien ship in “Unexpected” for example- the three hours of decompression before going on-board, the food growing on the walls, the different looking aliens with their electricity-like powers. The underground society of Terra Nova, their different way of speaking, the “diggers” that they hunt and how they use their skulls as musical instruments. The design of the Vulcan monastery. There were episodes of Voyager where they didn’t even bother to give the aliens forehead ridges, they just looked and behaved like humans and decorated with IKEA furniture.

It’s not just alien cultures, but the world building regarding human culture that I’ve been impressed with too. They don’t have Federation ideals to live up to because there is no Federation yet.  I like how informal and giddy they are, building snowmen on comets, preparing messages for schools on Earth, pointing out the sun in the night sky. Stuff like this makes it feel real to me. Of course the translator isn’t perfect, they’ve barely met any aliens. Of course they’re all scared to use the transporter, dude just beamed up with twigs in his face!

When the saucer crash lands and is destroyed, Picard gets sucked into the energy ribbon. Guinan helps him find Kirk and later they get out, fight Soran and somehow the people who crash landed are saved.

startrek,"Someone on here once summarized Enterprise as ""Bush era Star Trek"" and that nails it for me.

TNG and DS9 might be distinctively 90ies in their own way, but they encapsulate all the charm of low-budget sci-fi first and foremost. I would describe them as ""human"" rather than ""American"" or specifically dated to any decade. Same as the original series being obviously from the 60ies, but more so: timeless.

Enterprise is tainted by all the cold ugliness of early-2000s American television. Especially from a European perspective, it feels so distinctively national all of a sudden that it's really off-putting. it's not in the setting (post-national earth and space) or storyline, it's all evident on a meta-level in the languages of production, setpieces, character writing, themes, set design, costumes.

The whole show feels like it's desperate to be less niche and nerdy and more widely appealing to general American audiences in 2002 and as a result, lost its soul in the process.

I mean... There is a character named ""Trip Tucker"" who looks exactly like his dumb jock name. He likes to punch people.

TL:DR:

Enterprise lacks the warm and familiar, hopeful and fantastical identity of other Trek. If Jack Bauer had a guest spot on an Enterprise episode, he would feel *less out of place there* than a member of the Enterprise crew who  appeared on another Star Trek show in turn.

startrek,"I have been rewatching Voyager after the finale of Picard; and, after she goes full-on eye dilation in the cell, I got the impression that 7 is destined for Borg royalty. 

Here's my evidence. 

Going back to Dark Frontier,  you first see 7 and the queen interact.  What's so surprising about this is that the queen uses personal pronouns.   This is a trait that both she and 7 have in common.

Furthermore,  in the same episode, it's revealed that drones from unimatrix 01 are in close proximity to the queen.  7 of 9 is tertiary adjunct for 01, so we can infer that 7 had previous intersection with the queen prior to Scorpion.  Also, if we understand that higher numbers mean higher rank, as was the case when Harry Kim was demoted from 6 to 2 of 10 in the Omega Directive, then it adds more weight to the evidence that 7 would have routinely been in proximity to the queen. Though it's not clear the consequences of that proximity,  7 would have been an on hand for the queen.


Next, referring back to Dark Frontier, the queen focuses on teaching 7 lessons.  She tries to have her choose to adopt the Borg way, rather than have it foisted upon her.   The goal was to preserve the same individuality that the queen demonstrates,  but have 7 agree that the Borg way is correct.  This duality of making individual choices, but for the benefit of the collective,  may be a key requirement for coronation. 

Also, in the same episode, 7 is able to persuade the queen to let refugees escape assimilation,  7 is immediately tended to after a minor injury (royal treatment for a borg?), the queen compromises on her duties because she doesn't want to push 7 too hard (compromise is irrelevant), reveals that 7 was placed on Voyager to regain individuality, and apologizes that the lessons are difficult for 7.

This is all done under the guise of conquering humanity,  but consider that things can have dual intents.  While assimilating humanity is an obvious goal, this could also be about making 7 get successor.

Lastly, I refer you the Picard episodes involving Ex-Bs.  Their disconnection from the collective leaves the drones' personalities damaged.   But, as the queen says, 7 is the only drone to gain  Individuality.   This difference may be what would eventually empower 7 to exert will like the queen if/when crowned.  In Broken Pieces,  7 exerts this exact will in the cell after being wired in a similar fashion as the queen.

startrek,"So I'm just starting Voyager for the first time. After watching the first episode last week, I was so excited I just searched this sub for stuff regarding the series (trying to avoid spoilers).

But I was pretty sad because a lot of it was just talking about how the series has a lot of 'missed opportunities', etc... I remember one critique was regarding how quickly the whole crew got along instead of having lingering harsh feelings.

Maybe it's just because of quarantine and covid, but I *love* that they set aside their differences for the shared goal of **simply going home.** They knew they had to be there for each other. They knew they had to put their best talents to work in order to advance their mission and hopefully find an ingenious way of getting back to Earth.

It's such a heartwarming series to have right now, and damn do I wish we could all just set aside our differences and do what's best to...well... eventually get us out of our homes and be safe and healthy once again.

And honestly, Janeway is the best captain. My dream is for the series finale to end with her on Earth reunited with her Irish Setter, Mollie, and that her \~lover\~ kept one of Mollie's puppies for her too hehe.",Voyager...
startrek,"Personally I felt it dragged on way to long. During season seven we would be doing something with the war like the resistance or Starfleet, but then we would go back to Dukat and Winn and I’d just sigh. It felt like they were just putting enough in there to develop the story and to remind you that the plot existed but they needed to drag it for an entire season, so there wouldn’t be enough to actually answer anything. Then there was the finale. The dominion war ended very well, we had our big fight(that refused footage sadly), the founder gave up, we had tension with the Cardasians and then their switch midway through(which was lucky for Starfleet, since I noticed they were using the same tactics Robert E Lee used at Gettysburg and you know how that turned out.), you then went to the treaty and everything was fine, but then you had Dukat. He goes and summons the Pah wraiths. My problem is that I’ve never liked, “wipe out everything” threats, and that is exactly what the Pah-wraiths are. The only times I see them fitting is over the top superhero films, and DS9 isn’t one. Then Sisko destroys them by throwing him, Dukat and the book over into the fire, and now he is with the profits(I think?) I think it’s just me but it feels like an unsatisfying end to his character. I know the Prophets said that he could never live on Bajor, but really? You couldn’t have him move back to Earth, or just say fuck the Prophets and live on Bajor. I know it’s probably just me, but I don’t like it.",(Spoilers) What do you guys think of the Pah-wraith subplot in DS9
startrek,"The Silent Star (""Der Schweigende Stern"") is a 1960 East German/Polish science fiction film based on ""The Astronauts"" by  Stanisław Lem. While it is set (probably) in the 1970s as opposed to the 2260s, it has a very Star Trek Original Series vibe. It is about a multi-national group of scientists who have put aside earth-bound concerns (race, religion, politics, nationality) to get into a spaceship and go on an adventure together for the good of all humanity. 

But what is interesting is that you are seeing this familiar story told through a Soviet Bloc lens. In TOS, everyone works together but implicitly everyone is basically American - the ship is even the ""USS Enterprise"". In The Silent Star, it is implicit that the Soviets have the upper hand.

An example of what I mean: Toward the beginning, some reporters are interviewing the mission leader, a soviet professor. 
Reporter: ""Why not just a team of Soviet scientists? It's their rocket!"" 
Cosmonaut: ""Landing on Venus cannot only belong to one nation. We are not just internationalist in our politics. In a peaceful world we don't keep our successes to ourselves.""

The rocket is Soviet-built and they are letting an American tag along from a sense of good-will. The Soviets were also the first to land on the moon, and have an international research base there. It's the same happy, cooperative future, but with the Soviets on top! 

It's no surprise that a show made by and for Americans would be pro-American, and one by and for members of the Soviet Bloc would be pro-Soviet. I think it's an interesting jumping-off point for thinking about the implicit assumptions of Star Trek, though. A ""Star Trek"" made by Vulcans might look very different again. 

One last note, I don't want to push this film too hard: The plot is well-trodden ground by this point, and the details are a bit hard to follow in places. The gender politics are _very_ TOS as well, unfortunately. But I think in general, TOS fans may get a kick out of it.","Star Trek through a cold war lens: ""The Silent Star"" (1960)"
startrek,"I just recently finished watching the entire DS9 series for the first time. As a longtime fan of Voyager, TNG, and TOS, I never got around to watching DS9 until now. I simply wanted to praise the show - it was a really enjoyable experience to watch. Specifically:

* I felt like overall, the writing was consistently good throughout the series. Like other longstanding series of Trek I felt like the show definitely picked up and got better as it progressed. 
* I enjoyed the portrayal of Sisko and his son Jake as a normal single father and son relationship. They just genuinely loved each other and there wasn't ever any weird or forced tension between the two of them. It was simple, and it worked.
* I absolutely adored Odo and his whole backstory. I would have loved to have seen more done with him as a character, and I wish he would have been given more opportunities to use his unique shapeshifting abilities. Rene Auberjonois did an outstanding job in that role.
* I enjoyed the interesting storytelling that came out of the Dax character. I thought they handled the transition to Ezri Dax surprisingly well considering she was in it just for the one season.
* I loved Garek as a side character. Initially I thought he was really weird but I appreciated the development and attention he was given. I thought the actor who played him did a really good job. I wish there would have been more of him!
* I absolutely hated Vedek/Kai Winn but I think that is a testament to the actress's portrayal of her character and her writing. Both were well done.
* I did think Dukat was resurrected as a character too much. Once would have been fine but he ""came back"" too much after I was given the impression he was gone for good.
* I felt like the very last episode tied things up better than I expected it to. Compared to the very last episode of Voyager I found it to be a lot more believable and realistic.
* Standout episodes (sorry don't remember the specific names or #):
   * The one where the team recruits Garek to sneak into Cardassia
   * The one where they travel back in time to the TOS era (brilliant writing and editing in this one)
   * The one where Jake loses his dad in a freak accident and his entire life plays out trying to get his dad back (very good writing in this one - I cried!!)
   * The one where they form a baseball team - loved when Odo, with great satisfaction, booted people from the game.
* Can an HD remaster of DS9 and Voyager happen please?!?!

startrek,"I've been reading a lot lately about the constant advancements in virtual reality tech. Just last year London's Saatchi Gallery immersed visitors in a twenty-minute, interactive (mostly) ""virtual reality experience"" that they could see, hear, smell, and feel on their skin. Haptic tech is making it possible to experience the sensation of touching virtual objects or standing in a virtual wind. Right now VR developers are busy incorporating eye tracking tech into VR headsets, making better-quality graphics possible, because the virtual environment only has to be in full resolution where the user is looking. Artificial intelligence may soon enable non-player characters to engage in natural conversations. VR is constantly getting better at imitating reality. Eventually, it may seem very real.

Reading about all of the constant progress in VR led me to imagine a future in which you could experience almost anything you've seen in an episode of Star Trek, as if you were inside the Star Trek universe, almost like a holodeck with programs based on Star Trek episodes. Think of it. What if you could experience what it would be like to  stand on the bridge of the Enterprise, whichever registry number you prefer, as it goes into warp, pilot the Defiant through the Bajoran wormhole, challenge Kira Nerys to a game of springball, or visit the city of ShiKahr on the planet Vulcan with Spock as your guide? Personally, I'd be thrilled just to be able to walk the promenade of Deep Space Nine and see my favorite characters there or explore the interior of the Enterprise D. It might also be fun to play tongo with Jadzia Dax at Quark's (if someone would create rules for the game based on what we see and hear in DS9). 

Now imagine that you have access to a complete library of highly realistic, multi-sensory virtual environments faithfully recreated from all that we see in Star Trek TV shows and movies. **What would you do, if you could experience the Star Trek universe** ***from the inside*** **as a newly-created character?** What would you be?

No Chakotay means another love interest. I vote for Geordi. Finally, we have Worf who didn't see a threat he didn't want to set phasers on kill. I could see their relationship filled with tension until he overcomes his prejudice.

startrek,"And I just wanted to say a couple of things... spoilers incoming, obviously...

I really adored the three-way interaction between Seska, Culluh, and Janeway. Culluh is a deeply egotistical man who comes from a deeply misogynistic culture. Yet here, he is caught in between two extremely assertive, intelligent, and cunning women. As the negotiations slip out of his control, his own impotent misogynist rage drives him to attempt to reassert his authority, but Janeway just shuts him down and later so does Seska too.

Given Seska's skills and her domineering personality, it's very likely that had their takeover of Voyager in ""Basics"" succeeded, the Nistrim would have conquered all the other Kazon sects and began presiding over a united Kazon species. Culluh would be the de jure leader, but all power would effectively belong to Seska.

One minor detail that I found interesting - Tuvok was one of the conservative Starfleet officers who opposed Spock's proposed peace with the Klingons in 2293. As he will later share, at that time, he was serving on the Excelsior under Sulu, and he harbored an intense dislike for humans. When Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant, Tuvok was already over a 100 years old. His evolution really is interesting. 

This was a really great episode, and to top it off, it ends with a really inspiring speech from Janeway:

&gt;In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where  shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to  rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Federation.

startrek,"We are about a month away from the twenty-sixth anniversary of *All Good Things*, which first aired twenty-five years after *Turnabout Intruder -* 5/23/94 and 6/3/69 respectively. I know when I was a kid in the nineties (between about five and nine years old), TOS looked pretty hokey at times; I could easily tell it was an old show, from the womens' haircuts, the uniforms, the colors, the blockiness of the consoles and dated special effects and so on. TNG was, by comparison, super slick and brand new, all subdued tones and elegant curved surfaces. I enjoyed them both anyway - I always preferred the movies with the original cast, they just seemed much more human and, ironically, grounded in reality compared to the TNG films. 

Anyway, I assume people still introduce their kids to prior Star Trek, so I was wondering if kids these days see TNG as being just as hokey and outdated to them as the TOS did in our day. I've been perusing some of the remastered TNG episodes and they look gorgeous, but they also reveal some of the limits of the matte sets and costume makeup, which might look pretty corny to someone who didn't grow up with the lower-res originals.",Twenty and thirty-something parents of /r/startrek - does TNG look as dated to your kids as TOS looked to you at their age?
startrek,"To give a little context - about three years ago I decided I wanted to watch Star Trek. I'd grown up with TNG on the television but aside from seeing it on whenever someone else was watching it, I didn't know very much about the over arching story. I spent the next 20 months watching every iteration of Star Trek that was out there. I used to have the dates all saved as to when I started and finished each but it essentially went:

- TOS

- Star Trek Continues (I know its not canon but it was good)

- TNG

- DS9 (my personal favorite)

- VOY

- ENT

- DIS

In between Star Trek Continues and TNG I watched all six movies with the original series cast. After TNG I watched First Contact and Insurrection but somehow missed Nemesis. 

Late Friday I started the first season of Picard. By saturday I'd finished it and frankly I didn't think it was very good but I stuck it out. After it was over I really missed the Picard I grew to know over 7 seasons of TNG. I ended up sitting down and watching a marathon of First Contact, Insurrection and finally Nemesis. 

None of these were exactly fantastic movies by any stretch but they were, in my opinion, far more true to Picard's character than the actual Picard show was. Poor writing and plot aside, Picard's character in 'Picard' just seemed too different. The whole tone of the show was far more Discovery than it was TNG and frankly I think that was part of the problem. I don't dislike DIS (anymore - that first season was hard) but I had high hopes that Picard would be a return to the Trek of old...instead it was more of the same watered down new age Trek that we've seen since the JJ Abbrams movies and Discovery. 

I just miss the hopeful optimism of TNG and Captain Picard. I miss the vaulted speeches where he defends humanity's advancements to John De Lancie (as an example). Picard as a show really missed the point of Picard's character in my opinion and honestly I hope it gets better from here because I feel like it can't get much worse than a crappy French accent and an eye patch.","I ran a marathon yesterday with First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis and it made me really sad about Picard"

I miss the idealism of the earlier Star Trek, where we get to know the characters intimately and understand their challenges rather than big faceless entities with their corruption and failings etc.

Based on what they've said about the show, I've no interest in watching Picard. However, my ridiculous headcanon to explain the whole situation that caused the Zhat Vash is that a video game historian/nerd from somewhere in the 30th (or whatever) century went back in time to get the original Mass Effect trilogy for a museum, their personal collection, or something, experienced some catastrophe that sends their ship back in time to Aia and mostly damages the ship such that it's only able to beam bits and pieces of of the games into someone's head as a jumble, mixing the geth and the reapers with information about a &gt;!cyborg tentacled species!&lt; that should be avoided.

startrek,"Fans often talk at length about their favourite captain, but I want to discuss what you think about all of them. What do you like and dislike about them all? 

Here’s mine if anyone is interested. 

Pike
Best: He’s the most human, flawed yet heroic, and the epitome of StarFleet. When I think of a captain I’d like to serve with, it’s him. He’s my favourite.

Worst: Not enough of him.


Kirk
Best: The fact that he often decides what’s moral, rather then going with what’s expected of him. Unlike other captains, he knows that The Federation isn’t perfect and so he bends the letter of the law to do what he thinks is right. He is also a tactical genius, and charismatic as hell.

Worst: Due to sixties writing he can come off as a little emotionless, and sometimes too stern.

Picard
Best: Morally one of the finest officers in the fleet. Probably the most moral captain of all time. 

Worst: He is so goddamn stuffy and up himself. Especially early on. I get people love him a lot and I think he’s a great character, but if I knew him in real life, he’d be the worst boss.

Sisko
Best: I love his backstory and how he is a family man at heart. I love his relationship with the Bajorans, and think he’s a tactical genius. 

Worst: Too militaristic for me. Took too long to find his character. 

Janeway
Best: When written well, she is the paragon of virtue. Kind yet brave, commanding respect without being cruel. Moral without being naive. Also the smartest of all the captains we’ve seen. 

Worst: Unfortunately she was written inconsistently. Sometimes she’d be willing to bend the rules, other times she’d stick to her guns no matter what. Sometimes she was a warm kind person, other times she was cold and stern. 

Archer
Best: I love the flawed perspective of his character. Making him the person to inspire The Federation, he could have been too perfect, instead he was written as flawed and complicated. Sadly his arc was cut short, and we never got to see him at his best. He was also a keen strategist and a willing explorer.

Worst: Like Janeway, he was written inconsistently, although in my opinion less so. He sometimes became cold for no real reason, and other times he seemingly gave up his ethics all together. 


Georgiou and Lorca
I’m including these two together, because to me they’ve both got the exact same flaws and qualities, but for completely opposite reasons.

Best: I immediately want a show for both these characters. They are portrayed by fantastic actors and had a lot of stories to tell. If they were allowed to run their course, they may be in my top rung of captains. 

Worst: They weren’t allowed to run their course. For one reason or another they were both written out of their stories at the earliest possible place and weren’t allowed to evolve. In the case of Lorca, the biggest shame was the end twist. Before that we were given a complex and morally grey man. Sadly that didn’t last, and he was quickly turned into a moustache twirling villain. I didn’t mind the idea, in fact it was very well done, but the final execution wasn’t good enough. Sad.",What Are You’re Thoughts On All The Captains?
startrek,"At least twice the Borg tried to assimilate Earth with only 1 cube (second time with a sphere in it as well) and failed. 

The Borg Queen told 7 of 9 they they wouldn't succeed a 3rd time which is why they wanted to develop another method of assimilation by assimilating them by throwing a nanoprobe virus into the atmosphere which is a method they were developing for ""highly resistant species""

Why not just sent multiple Cubes if they want Earth so badly? They obviously wanted Earth badly enough to go thru the trouble of capturing 7 of 9 to help them in the assimilation so it seems to me like it would be worthy of them to spare a few Cubes for a while away from another task. Seems efficient enough to me and worth it from their perspective

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would happen if different Star Trek captains, main ones from the shows or maybe others if they are fleshed out enough, found themselves faced with the Deep Space Nine assignment?

I've been pondering this specifically with reference to Deep Space Nine, because in that series the chain of events that unfolds kind of isn't focused on Sisko, he is at the forefront of events and he definitely shapes them, but a lot of what goes on is bigger than him. Theoretically any captain could take that assignment, of course he's the emissary as well, but hypothetically we could assume another captain was a child of the prophets instead.

So what, in you good folks opinion, would happen if for whatever reason Picard had caught the DS9 assignment, or Janeway? Or maybe Riker gets his first command on the station, or some sort of time-skipped Kirk, Archer or Lorca?

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thoughts are:

Picard probably messes it up and the Dominion wins. I could see him handling the Cardassians more effectively, because he's got longstanding beefs there, but I think the Vorta would be able to play him long enough to get a foot in the door and take the Alpha Quadrant. If he got tested the same way that Sisko did to work out his intentions in that simulator the Dominion might be all like, ""Solids are back on the menu boys!"" and just go straight in.

Janeway is plenty ruthless enough to get things done and I suspect that her closer relationship with Starfleet (remember Sisko is about to quit when he takes the job) probably means less guff from Bajoran separatists, more redshirts on the ground of Bajor and more ships at the wormhole on the regular. So I could see things all going pretty stale in that regard, a perpetual standoff.

Kirk flirts with the female changeling and the war is called off.

startrek,"While I enjoyed the episode overall (although I don't get why it was so necessary to study the quasar immediately instead of coming back here after delivering the medicine... but whatever) I have to say the ending is really strange.

You know what I'm talking about, the way they all try to make Spock realize he actually acted on emotion instead of pure cold logic for once. They're all having a hoot, laughing and in a really good jolly mood. Immediately after they just lost two crew members who were brutally murdered. Really?

startrek,"A thing I have turning over in my mind a lot is why I don't like new Trek and I think I finally know why. Some Picard season 1 spoilers below. 

The last two seasons of new Star Trek, but also just a lot of science fiction in general, do these ultimate ""all life everywhere at risk"" storylines and it takes all the weight out of a story.

I was listening to the The Greatest Discovery podcast and they were talking about all the ways the themes of Picard season 1 were unfolding and upon re-watching, yeah, I could see all that, but it didn't make me feel anything.

I feel like introducing some kind of universe ending super bad guy robs the story of any weight it could have had. We know they're probably not ending Picard on a note of all organic life is getting destroyed, so the stakes don't feel real. All the best episodes of Star Trek are ones with personal or political stakes, where the outcome is genuinely uncertain. Obviously the format dictates a return to some form of status quo, that's television. But I feel like this kind of ultra high stakes scenario is so cartoonish, _especially_ when it's the kind you can solve by hitting the right button at the last second.

There's a lot of criticism of gritty Trek and that it should be more optimistic and I don't agree with that. Some of the best Trek is about taking a hard look at moral ambiguity, such as the Maquis plotlines in DS9. What I think is missing from modern Trek is the mundane. You could have the same story of Picard season 1 but, in my opinion, many times more effective if everything just happened at a smaller scale. You don't need to invent an extra secret Romulan police, you don't need an AI that will end all organic life, this can be a story about Picard trying to do right by the people he's wronged and about how he misses Data and is forced to contemplate death and age and his own blind idealism. Those are all great themes that the show is tackling. I don't think it needs big AI space worms being summoned through a portal.

This got a little rambly. Anyway. Curious to hear what you all think.",I'm tired of high stakes science fiction.
startrek,"An interesting experience! I watched the season in the space of about a week, so everything was fresh going through. 

It would have been nice if the mycelial realm wasn't a multiverse-ending disaster waiting to happen, as an infinite number of universes will result in one ignoring the warning signs and killing everything. However, I can see it being a multiverse-spanning network essential to their travel to the mirror universe. I enjoyed the references to interphasic space, Defiant, and transporter travel in an ion storm. 

The overshoot on return could have been bigger. I found it disappointing that the Federation could be broken so thoroughly in less than a year. 

Some of Burnham's voiceovers were good, others a little cheesy. Still, an actor can only do so much with their lines and direction. 

Now, I did find mirror Georgiou disappointing. She just hands over the detonator and walks away. Who was Admiral Cornwell's speech for anyway? The bridge crew had to know the real captain was dead and all of them knew of the mirror universe. 

Starfleet resorting to genocide to win the war is...it's not ideal. I would expect more from the Federation. I think if we were in the war longer, seeing the endless grind and loss of system after system, it would have been easier to accept their resorting to genocide. Popping in at the end leaves us too fresh to accept the desperation. 

I don't think L'Rell will have a long-term hold on the Klingon Empire if her only tool is to kill everyone. I'm also deeply surprised that a small Klingon task force in eyesight of Earth (undefended, no Starfleet ships in sight) would turn back when they could claim the honor of desecrating the enemy homeworks. 

Having watched the clip on YouTube back when it first aired, I got very excited when we reached The Scene. Seeing Enterprise and hearing the theme put a massive smile on my face and a thrill in my heart.

However, despite I love the show ideas and the casting, the characters are underdeveloped and underused.

However, it is completely antithetical to the essence of the Borg that they have a Queen.

startrek,"In VOY: Year of Hell, Part 1, Tom Paris likens the construction of transverse bulkheads throughout Voyager's hull to the watertight bulkheads on the ancient Earth steamship RMS Titanic.

According to Memory Alpha, Year of Hell was filmed in August of 1997, with the scripts presumably being put together just prior. The episode first aired in November 1997.

According to Wikipedia, James Cameron's Titanic began production in 1996, aiming for a July 1997 release date, before eventually slipping to an actual premier in December 1997.

Voyager originally aired on the United Paramount Network (UPN), and Titanic was in part produced and released by Paramount Pictures.

So, two questions:

1. For anyone who watched Year of Hell's initial broadcast: how aware of the Titanic was the general public at this time? As far as I can tell, contemporary common knowledge would mostly have stemmed from the 1958 movie A Night to Remember, and possibly news coverage of Ballard's discovery of the wreckage in 1985. Was this reference to the structural composition of that ship well understood? As someone born in 1993 who didn't start watching Star Trek until 2007, I could so vividly imagine those dramatic watertight door scenes from the film, but I wonder if the same was true prior.

2. Is there any evidence that this was a sly advertisement by Paramount for their major upcoming James Cameron helmed motion picture? Presumably the buzz around the movie would've been out by the beginning of 1997, maybe even a Superbowl commercial, if they we're aiming for a summer release.

startrek,"V has never been my favorite, nor most people's. But I recently rewatched it with my daughter and I realized that there were a lot of moments that had stuck with me. 

For all the life and death they went through in the other films, some of the most personal moments where in V. It's the only time, that I can recall, that we see the crew on actual out of uniform shore leave. We get to see how they interact with each other when their not on duty or doing anything particularly interesting. 

We learn not only about their families and their losses but how much these experiences effected them personally. When Sybock reveals Spock's pain to him,  Spock's emotional silence is DEVASTATING. All his logic and discipline mean nothing in that moment, and that's what arguing with your brother is like. We learn that they never got over these traumas and probably never will, they just learned to live around them, and they never shared these things with their closest friends. Like real people. 

To this day, when I'm upset about something and someone tries to dismiss it with a platitude, I still remember Kirk saying, ""I don't want my pain taken away from me. I NEED my pain!"" To him, he's not a hero, he's someone who thinks very deeply about pain and loss and death and that's what drives him. He can be cocky and brash on the surface, but underneath he's very aware of the risks he takes. The other movies told us a great deal about WHO Kirk is, I thought V did the best to explain WHY Kirk is.

Now, there's a lot of silliness and schlock, too, so it's still not my favorite. But it got me wondering what might have been. There was a good movie in there somewhere, it just never got finished.",I wish Star Trek V had been more realized.

I never watched any of the movies but today decided to watch the first one from 1979. I loved it! For some reason it made me feel emotional and I ended up with tears several times during the movie. 

I'm a grown man and not the sort to cry during movies but for some reason this movie filled me with joy! I can't wait to watch the second one.","Long time Star Trek (original series) fan. Watched the first movie from 1979, today, and I cried."
startrek,"Jake Sisko should have done an investigative report on his fathers actions with the Maquis specifically with regards to the bio bombing of the Maquis colony making it inhabitable to human life and forcing the people living there to mass evacuate with nothing but the clothes on their back. This should have led Jake down a road of further investigating some of his fathers decisions and turning over some very uncomfortable stones. Real Star Trek is a show that displays what intellectual, wise, self actualized adults and societies do to resolve problems in the most humanist/ethical way they can. The themes of the Federation have never been about them or humanity not having problems but how their approach to resolving problems differs from what has been done before without a humanist ideology. Showing how the Federation deals with freedom of the press and a citizens access/right to information was a big missed opportunity.

Next, Captain Sisko should have died with no hint or suggestion of coming back to life or being saved by the Prophets. Arguably DS9's biggest long term theme was ""this is what it takes for the Federation to build and manifest their ideology after the first contact and diplomacy ships leave."" DS9 shows a lot of what it takes including the occasional deaths. Yet none of these deaths have really hit home including Jadzia Dax or Tasha Yar and that's because we know that the actors were leaving the show for personal reasons and it being less about a natural flow of story. But if Sisko really died at the end we would be sitting here and saying DS9 deliberately showed us what kind of hard choices and sacrifices it takes to keep the Federation, this humanist future, going with the lead character of a series. That people (aliens included in that word) may and do die with their eyes wide open to keep the ideology alive because it's a way of life worth preserving and living in not just for oneself but for everyone you love and even those you don't. Instead we are left with this imo completely ""Meh, he'll be back probably..."" ending that to me really doesn't have a lesson or theme to it.",🤔 Two Really Big Missed Opportunities In DS9
startrek,"Hello all, 

I have a dilemma (see captivating title). 13 years ago, when I was a youth, I was a dumb kid (see captivating title). I was entrusted with my aunt’s keys so I could come and go while she was gone. I opted to stay at my boyfriend’s a few nights, and was picked up before she returned. When I gave her keys back, she screamed at me. On her keys, was a Ferengi keychain from Star Trek: The Experience, with Rule of Acquisition #21: “Never place friendship before profit” on it. It was gone. Fallen, no doubt, while I was galavanting around as a careless youth. We searched everywhere. His apartment, the parking lot, all of the grounds. She didn’t speak to me for a week. 
Fast Forward: I’ve been searching for this keychain on and off for years with ZERO luck.  With covid-19 coming around, and my aunt and I now both being healthcare workers, I resumed my search, in hopes to brighten out spirits. My sheer chance, I found a seller on Facebook! He mailed me the keychain for a low price. I was ECSTATIC. Unfortunately, it was premature. I received the envelope, but the corner was torn off, and the product was gone. I made many frantic calls to my post office, his, and mail recovery. They don’t hold on to “trinkets”. I’m devastated, folks. So I’m turning to here. And everywhere. To try to find this damn keychain! I have a picture of it, but I can’t figure out how to get it to post. I can tell you that it’s from Star Trek: The Experience. Round. Ferengi. If anyone can help, or share this everywhere, I have all the love for you. I’d pay a pretty penny to bring her a smile! 

Thanks!!

startrek,"I get it - Discovery and Picard are intended to draw more casual fans into the show. And while there's plenty of fan service easter eggs throughout both series with great levels of attention to detail, ignoring certain major canon remains an unacceptable oversight.

1. In Picard, no reference was made of Data's first daughter Lal, or his brother Lore. To me, this detracted from the strength of the overall plot and characters. Heck, Lore played a major part of Hugh's experiences in Descent I and II!

2. While Chabon acknowledged the Dominion War behind-the-scenes, no mention of it was made on-screen in Picard which detracts from the the world building as well as Picard's experiences with evacuating the Romulans, standing up for their rights, etc. Not only does it discredit DS9, but in past Trek shows, references to other not-shown wars and events were often made (Earth-Romulan War, Federation-Cardassian War, World War III, Eugenics War, etc.)

3. Some of Discovery's marketing materials had Burnham listed as ""first black lead"" doing Avery Brooks/Benjamin Sisko a major disservice again to DS9. I can understand if media outlets made this mistake, but CBS and Star Trek themselves shouldn't have.",CBSAA-Trek selectively ignoring certain major canon is an unacceptable oversight.
startrek,"Rewatching this episode post-Picard it’s like they took this one episode and built Picard’s principles around synths for the show from it. 

Maddox says he wants to create “hundreds maybe thousands” of Datas and Picard challenges him to consider that if they are a race how they will be viewed and treated if they are not considered sentient, and how humans will be viewed based on that. 

It is the same argument Picard essentially makes through season 1; to Starfleet after the incident, to Synths, and to Soji. 

And then- Picard himself becomes a synth!

Recently she just finished Discovery and is interested in watching Picard- I told her that she would need to watch at least some TNG and the movies. Do you all agree? She didn’t seem that enthusiastic about 7 seasons and 4 movies before getting into it.

startrek,"Let me start by saying I love Star Trek.  I’ve basically found ways to justify every series and movie.  Yes god had use for a Star ship!  

I enjoyed every series including Enterprise which was just staring to hit its stride when it was canceled.  I love the original series/crew and movies. I liked the first reboot film of this crew as well and felt they could have built a really cool different legacy in the different timeline but was really disappointed by the 2nd one and very meh in the 3rd.  

Kirks crew were part of my childhood and that crew will always be special for me.  If they don’t come back I’m good with it.  It seems a shame the reboot crew never got the 5 year mission(RIP Anton :( ). 

TNG was also amazing and I consumed all of it, including the movies DS9, Voyager.  Recently I watched Picard, and while it’s not TNG, it was nice to see a post TNG world.  It doesnt have the magic that TNG had, but I like some elements of it very much.  I felt like they should have explored 7 of 9 going to the dark side. That moment got me nerd giddy at the possibility of her as the queen. Maybe something for the future.  Also why waste Hugh?...

I’m also not sure I like the daughter, which makes me sad because Data is one of the greatest characters of all time.  Season 2 will be huge.  For me, it made me appreciate TNG because your exploring the Picard and Data missions that are so important to Picards overall story now.  

Now for Discovery...I’m three episodes in and must say.. What am watching here?  Robots on the bridge in this era?  Mind melds create infinite conversations now at anytime? Mutiny?  Firing first?  Those are Klingons?!  What in the Worf am I watching?

Ok I like some things about the gatherings but why do they all sound like they have congestion?  Why are they all bald now?  They are shiny and sparkly now but they lost all the substance and flavor that was so incredible in TNG and DS9 storylines.  

As far as the new crew, not sure what to think of Michael but she’s growing on me.  The rest of the crew is kinda blah for me.  Nobody stands out as of yet, not even tall dude and I always like Doug Jones.  Not feeling this story either.  Hoping it gets better...

I was insanely enthusiastic before the season began and was keeping up week by week for maybe the first 5 episodes. And thats when I started trailing off.

Started the Finale last night and I don't even know where to begin with how bad it was. 

1. What the hell was that magic device they all of the sudden acquired that can read your imagination and make anything possible? Where was that the whole time? Or an explanation of how it works? 

2. How is Jean-Luc ""sacrificing"" his life by dying from a condition he's had since TNG? And why was everyone crying when they just knew they had a body ready for him? And if they could do that with Jean-Luc in 5 minutes why had Data been in there for so many years? 

3. I'll combine my last two points into one. When Riker just shows up out of the blue with 200 star ships was so lame. Why the Romulans were just waiting baffled me. Those Orchids weren't enough to stop 218 war birds. Then we finally get to see what we were waiting to see, the synths were coming through the portal and Soji just slams the portal and it closes. Finally, what was that ridiculous scene at the end between Seven and Raffi holding hands? They hardly knew each other. They had, what, 4 minutes of screen time together?

Is there major legal requirements in doing even just that?
---------------------

Anyway here the rough idea and plot:

It's the mid 25th century. Guinan recognized for her wisdom and good counselling is working at the main Starfleet medical unit for mental health as a therapist (yes she had to get certified still) helping officers with anxiety and other emotional challanges.

Guinan goes home to her condo after work in San Francisco and as she is getting ready to sleep, she gets ""a feeling"" something is in the air. She starts looking around the house and doesn't know what's wrong but she knows something is up. Next thing you know, Q shows up

Q says long time no see. They argue a bit about their past (I won't spoil the details here) and then Q reveals why he's there.

Q says the humans continue to advance faster than any of them thought possible and are crutial for future events in the Universe to unfold as they predict (never explains exactly what it is that humans are supposed to accomplish in the far far future). In the shorter term they are also critical to save the galaxy from a more immediate threat both to themselves and the rest of the Federation and Galaxy, the Borg which remain a powerful foe.

In recent decades the Borg not only fully repaired and restored their transwarp network destroyed by Voyager, but are stronger than ever assimilating the galaxy at a rate like never before and humans with the aid of other species and allies in the powerful Federation are the only species both powerful enough but also adaptable and creative enough with solutions to battle such a foe

Q warns that if humanity is gobbled up by the Borg things will not happen as they must. Q reminds Guinan that she knows very well what's at stake for the Universe (once again Q does not specify what he means, but Guinan seems to know what he's talking about)

Guinan begins to argue that the Q continuum should just do something about it and snap the Borg out of existance despite Qs insistance that his hands are tied and the rules from the continuum do not allow him to simply take such a species out of existance just like that without specific rare reasons and that warning humanity on a need to act on the Borg was his only indirect loophole he could take in their destruction (if not destruction, at least partial suppression, or kept under control)

Q states that the reason he chose to contact her of all people is not only because she now has a career and history with Starfleet as a very trusted member that can relay the message and taken seriously, but Guinan also understands what's fundamentally at stake for the future like no one else in the Federation, tho she cannot reveal everything she knows Q is talking about to Starfleet or the Federation

This story I have in mind would not only involve a lot of battle scenes since it's against the Borg... But the story would reveal a lot of mysteries about what the Q are, and what Guinans species fundamentally are too and what their connection with the Q is as well. 

However some details of the history of the Q and Guinan and the El-Aurians and who they fundamentally are would still remain ambiguous. This story would only be a progression in our understanding of those mysterious beings, and further hints that humanity will one day in the far inconceivable future (like Q once told Riker) will one day be a major race not just in the Galaxy but in the Universe and surpass the Q. However again, it will not ruin what that mystery is because the story will only make ambiguous hints, not actually outright reveal everything.

In it, Janeway opens up a resort simulation with holographic beach goers on the holodeck to lure the macroviruses inside. The macroviruses killed the holographic people. And what's more disturbing is that the Doctor went along with it. Now, I know Janeway did this to save her crew from the macroviruses, but still, if a holographic person is capable of sentience, wouldn't what Janeway did be considered genocide?","In Macrocosm, did Janeway commit genocide?"

I'm not gunna lie, I enjoyed it more than First Contact and Insurrection. Although, I'd already seen First Contact when it came out. Insurrection put me to sleep. It was a lot more action packed, but there was some weird immersion breaking stuff.

Like, how did this human clone get so much power? How'd he become a leader of an entire alien race of people in such a short period of time? Why does the slave race, the Remens, have such advanced technology in comparison to the Romulans? Why do the Romulans fear him? Why are the Romulans so nice the the Enterprise at the end?

The series follows the crew of the USS Discovery as they encounter new worlds and civilizations, delving into familiar themes and expanding upon an incident that has been talked about within the franchise's universe, but never fully explored.""

It’s a similar situation with the Maquis: we aren’t supposed to just condemn them out of hand as terrorists and yet that’s the stance people are taking, unhappy that the show seems to be justifying terrorism.

startrek,"Each crew and captain have their own personalities and exceptional feats, but which captain saved the Federation/universe the most?

I am also counting times where they either inadvertently made a decision that would later save the day, or stop something which would have a horrendous impact on the rest of the universe. 

Both Kirk and Picard have numerous fears under their belts. Archer brought an end the that Cold Time War. Sisko was instrumental in winning the Dominion War. Janeway crippled the Borg and prevented them attacking the Federation, and Discovery helped win the Klingon War and stopped Control. I’m obviously missing some, so which captain do you think had the biggest impact?

I’m not asking which captain is your favourite. I’m asking which had a biggest impact.

Personally I’d say Kirk because he tended to go up against “god tier” enemies that would change everything if left unchecked. (Not to mention all those computers he talked to death).

startrek,"S1E9 - Hide and Q

As a preface, I am watching through TNG for the first time and am sharing my running thoughts while watching each episode.

So we start off the episode by learning that the Enterprise is on their way to save 504 severely injured people, and they’re prepared for them all. Holy cow that is just insane to me. I guess I don’t comprehend how large the Enterprise really is. 

Worf pouring out his drink from Q was great. The reasoning was explained as a Klingon code: “Thou shall not drink with thy enemy.” Might have liked it more without the explanation honestly. 

Q’s Penalty Box. Might be a cool name for a bar or maybe a band?

The reason Q goes after Riker instead of Picard is because Q thinks Picard is too competent basically. Riker definitely falls more susceptible to Q’s charm but to be fair his challenge was much more difficult than Picard’s. 

Data once again proved how strong he was when he was tossing cinderblocks like they were foam (which they probably are haha)

Deepest wishes list:

Data - to become human

Wes - to be 10 years older. That’s not what Wil Wheaton looks like irl haha

Geordi - to see. Hey it really is LeVar under that mask!

Worf - wants a Klingon wife. Apparently Klingon sex is crawling?

Riker - wanted Q’s power

All of them rejected these wishes as the human way is to strive for more and earn things themselves. I hate to disagree but I think a lot of people would take their deepest wishes at the snap of a finger. But under those circumstances I can see why they all declined. 

It seemed to me that that was the last we’ll see of Q. I wouldn’t be mad, he’s kind of a prick.",Star Trek TNG S1E9 Episode Discussion

“Ji’Zya sector, location of the first major conflict between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets in the year 2191, has been hotly contested since, with battles occurring most notably in 2212, 2223, and 2245. The last major battle occurred in 2245 at Donatu V, the battle proved just as inconclusive as the prior three. Both the Federation and Klingons lay claim to the worlds within the sector, Donatu V, Sherman’s Planet, and the Gsynerria system. The Federation operates a deep space station, K-7, within the sector, while the Klingons also operate an outpost.”

Star Trek Picard doesn't necessarily have to be *permanently* set in this post-Nemesis era.  Each season could be set in a different time period (a la Archer jumping around, *but not as absurd*).  We could have a season that covers the Academy years, another season that covers the Stargazer years, and so forth and etc...

startrek,"I've noticed a lot of conflicting love and hate remarks with replicators over the series of Star Trek

I remember in TNG when they were carrying the primative farmers the guy loved the whiskey from the replicator. There have also been other times when they praised the quality of the replicators.

But then have also been many instances where characters showed frustration with replicators and their quality

- Tom Paris on the first episode of Voyager was unimpressed with the quality of the tomato soup

- Deanna Troy did not like the ""nutritionally enhanced"" ice cream and wanted real ice cream

- In the new Star Trek Picard they have consistently jabbed at how the the quality of the taste of replicated food is inferior especially in episode 7 when Picard meets Deanna and Riker on the planet

- I also remember the officer who defected to the Maquis in DS9 (forget his name now) sh*t talking how crappy replicator food was like no tomorrow when they were in the shuttle craft


With all the criticism the replicators have had they have also been hailed at times. Would that be from people that don't know real food just like how some kids these days hail frozen food? I remember loving frozen pizza as a little kid for example until tasting REAL Pizza could it be a simmilar thing? But then again the primative man did love the whiskey

Also the fact that they still farm in the future and Picard grows grapes suggests there has so be some kind of demand for real food. If real food wasn't better why farm at all? Or could it be to conserve power?

 We do know that replicators require A LOT of energy (Voyager often had to ration replicators when power reserves were down even more than holodecks). Could it be challanging to supply billions in a planet with replicated food alone so farming was still required?

So I guess I'm asking 2 questions here. Is their quality truly inferior to real food? and why farm still if food can be replicated? Thoughts",Replicators... Loved Or Hated? Why?
startrek,"I have been a Star Trek Fan since I was 9 years old. It started with my dad whatching Star Trek Voyager which I was instantly hooked on. I rewhatched every re-run of Voyager constantly and years later once streaming online became a thing started whatching it yet again

I did branch out into other Star Treks too. The Next Generation was the second one I whatched which I really liked as well (tho not as much as Voyager at the time), then Star Trek Enterprise when it came out, eventually I gave Deep Space 9 a chance even tho I innitially refused to whatch it finding it boring (I honestly think now its actually my favorite) and I've whatched every movie (all 13 both from TOS and The Next Generation and the new modern ones), and the new series Discovery and Picard (I love Picard btw) but it all started with Voyager

But the last several years I have an ever growing love/hate relationship with Voyager each time I give it a little whatch and now as I got older (I'm turning 27 in a month) because in many ways it seems like the most badly done of all the star treks and I'm sorry but I'm about to go on a rant:

#1 Captain Janeway can't act to save her life. It was especially bad in the first couple seasons. She was very stiff and very extra and her lines seemed so forced. It did get better in the later seasons but only ""acceptable"" she never became great in my opinion

#2 The characters and cast were super dry. Harry Kim, Kes &amp; Chakotay were literally plain dry toast with no personality. Tuvok gets a pass because Vulcans are supposed to be that way but when half the cast is already boring to begin with adding a lifeless Vulcan makes it intolerable. The characters all were overly formal and sounded over rehearsed

The characters that DID have personality often had the other extreme of having too much like they were making up for the lifeless cast. Neelix and the Doctor in particular were way too extra. Between Chakotay, Kes, Harry and Tuvok being too dry, Neelix &amp; the Doctor being too extra, and Captain Janeway being a terrible actress... Tom Paris is the only character I tolerated and Balana Torris and 7 of 9 the only 2 characters I genuinely liked

#3 They constantly threw obvious issues under the rug when they didn't want to deal with it in the plot. As if it wasnt obvious that there's no way for example that the Maquis crew would blend in so nearly perfectly into a Starfleet crew with minimal problems for example. Yeah a couple episodes early on touched on the tension between the crew but they moved on unrealistically quickly from that.

#4 the contradictions never end. Whether it's the limited number of torpedoes they supposibly had never running out despite use all series long without them ever explaining how they overcame the problem of their production, or there being enough deaths over the entire series to kill a limited sized crew that can't be replaced 2 times over. Like come on


It also got on my nerves to see Neelix and Kes so frequently in senior officers meetings. Like why is the Chef/Cook and trainee nurse always there? Just cuz they are part of the main cast doesn't mean u gotta throw them in when it doesn't make sense.

Basically as a huge trekie that first got introduced to the Star Trek Universe (and science fiction in general) thanks to Star Trek Voyager, and considered it my fav show in general, I now consider it one of the weakest if not the most poorly done of all the Star Trek series (excluding obvious shortcoming like TOS graphics of the times obviously)

I will say that at least it had my favourite looking ship and I did like the frequent encounters with the Borg if that counts for anything",As An Old Star Trek Fan Looking Back... Voyager Gets On My Nerves

Anyways, is it me or does the technology between TOS and TNG onwards seem rather similar? They're set a hundred years apart. Think about the technology in the 1910s and 1920s, now think about technology in 2020. Why does it seem that TOS's gizmos are merely a bulkier and maybe a bit obsolete version of TNG's?

Why is it, though, that it always has to be Janeway who is the hero?

I also love the way this was set up seasons ago with the Kes episode where she is going backwards in time.

Still, a couple of things:

1) Didn't Kes tell them what the frequency was? I know she did as she moved backwards in time, but surely she would have told them as she started moving forwards. Yes. I know they said certain things should not be disclosed, but why would they not disclose the frequency of the torpedo?

2) Obviously there was a change in that now it was Seven that finally found the frequency and not Kes... I guess this is just showing different possible timelines.","Voyager ""The Year of Hell"""
startrek,"
There is a major difference between DS9’s darkness and Discovery’s/Picard’s darkness. DS9 treated its serious topics seriously. During that episode where Obrian was implanted with fake memories, O’Brien’s experience as a prisoner is taken seriously, and his prison lifestyle, his increased agitation and his inability to change or move on nearly makes him commit suicide. All of this is taken seriously. When Nog came back after loosing his leg at the siege of AR-558, he essentially had PTSD, and sealed himself away in a holosuite with Fontaine to get away from everything. The topic isn’t joked about, glorified, or just used casually, it is a serious matter taken seriously by the show. Speaking of, the Siege of AR-558 isn’t some Vietnam war movie, where their mowing down the Vietcong with a machine gun mounted to a Huey. It is a horrible thing, where people die, where Nog, a person close to being a child, loses his leg. It’s dirty, it’s grim, it’s dark, but most importantly it was serious. In fact, Star trek’s worst episodes were when they didn’t take topics or themselves seriously, take Profit and Lace, Code of honor, etc.

Nutrek however doesn’t take anything seriously. Suicide is just referenced casually(“why didn’t I just put a phaser to my head and end it all?”-Seven of Nine “I think about suicide every day”-Agnes and I think there are at least three scenes of suicide). While you would think ptsd would be taken seriously, notably Picard’s with the borg, its forgotten about after a few minutes. If modern producers made DS9, we would have seen a 2 minute scene of Bashir fucking butchering Nogs leg and then another two minute scene of the fake leg being shoved up the gored leg, but since the show was mature, it didn’t glorify violence. DS9 didn’t want violence to happen, it was still Star Trek, when battles were shown it was a struggle and during Sacrifice of angels, getting back DS9 was almost a phyrric victory, and when they finally won and were on Cardasia, only Martok drank, while Sisko(who would have, out of anyone, a justifiable hatred for Cardasians) says, “That May be the case, but that does not mean I have to toast over their dead bodies.” Meanwhile in Discovery, “I want to here you scream”. When DS9 talked about means to an end, such as in the pale moonlight, the entire episode is devoted to the topic. It deals with the struggle of the people involved and the sacrifices you have to make to save lives, even if they seem immoral. Discovery went, “ACTION! IM GONNA FUCKING STAB YOU, FUCK YOOOOOOOU” and then realized they needed to have a, “moral dilemma” so they placed a bomb on Qo’noS and then had Michael go, “we cAn’T BloW UP ThE planeT, tHERE’s liKe, PeOplE HEre anD StuFf.” It makes me sad to see that something made by Seth Macfarland takes more seriousness than an official Star Trek production.",Why darkness worked in DS9 and why I’m sick of hearing it as an excuse
startrek,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Star Trek Picard and the Star Trek fandom as a whole a lot lately, and I realized that so many feel that they either have to love something unconditionally or hate it. As a life long Star Trek fan, I’m only a teen but my dad got me started on TNG when I was 4/5, I really liked Star Trek Picard. It did have two outstanding flaws in my opinion, however. 

Flaw 1 is simpler to explain, the show was just paced extremely weird, the first 3 episodes felt like they could fit into one, yet later episodes felt like they would benefit from being allocated more time. Using extra time gained from tinkering the pacing could be used to insert some more Trekky character moments that a lot of people, including my self, want. 

Flaw 2 is more broad. There were a lot of really, really, really, really stupid decisions. These decisions didn’t have much of an impact on story imo, but just generally felt out of place. Examples of these for me would be the overabundance of Disco style shuttles, the copy paste fleet in the Finale, the death of Hugh, the overly grotesque Icheb scene, etc. As I said, these don’t really impact the story, and some, for me the Icheb scene, didn’t strike me as all that bad, but looking back on these areas, it seems like they were either just lazy and asking for backlash. 

Overall, however, I liked Picard and like New Star Trek as a whole. I just hope future series put some work into the whole pacing thing and I really think Picard going forward and Disco going forward may begin to compare to some of the greatest sci fi ahows(DS9, Babylon 5, and the new Battlestar)",My take on Picard.

So my question comes from what I'm familiar with from TNG to DS9 since that is what I saw when I was a child (tells you my age). Is it possible that V'Ger possibly created or encountered the Borg before it's contact with Kirk and company?

A multi species crew, an enterprise-y set up but a travelling ship of new design that is almost as much a travelling space station as it is a ship that can be part home, part factory, part base for scout ships - perhaps it's even longer, a ten year mission - something that really evokes going into the unknown like the Apollo program - but to add contrast you also have b plots set in the closer to home areas on earth or thereabouts dealing with federation politics and research and so on that can involve returning characters and smaller b plots. Perhaps the base station that is running the mission, geordi la forge and miles o Brien are running the program from earth, problems have to be solved from a distance like a mission control, and human stories as earth advances with other programs and politics. Haven't thought much more but any ideas to flesh it out welcome.

My first thought was ""what a weird title"". It was evocative of nothing without any context, and I knew nothing about this episode going in.

And I'm glad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times and I mean that in a good way. After episodes like I Mudd, I thought I'd seen it all but this was another delightful curveball I never saw coming. Man, ANYTHING can happen on this show can't it?

Right away something's off when Kirk's asked to meet Okmyx (whose name I originally misheard as Ox Mix, which was interesting) by the ""yellow fire plug"". The contrast in tech between the Enterprise and the Ioatians is funny off the bat. And then bam, we're in a 1930's gangster film (though there's a lot of influences from 30s/40s crime cinema, Little Caesar seems to be a particular reference here.) And it's a great job too, with the thug actors hamming it up, and drivebys, fistfights, cards, even some molls. Integrating the sci-fi elements with this would seem to be a tall order, but it's an ingenious and really interesting premise - a starship crew left behind a book on earth history dealing with the Chicago mob era, the primitive locals became fascinated with it as an artifact of an advanced race, and modeled their civilization on it, it becomes their bible as McCoy says.

Anthony Caruso does a great job as crime boss Okmyx, but it kept bugging me - I'm sure I've seen him before, the name/face is familiar but I can't place it. Little touches, such as how the Federation are referred to ""the feds"" are hilarious . The sets are particularly good, and as a pinball nut I appreciated how they have some oldtime pinball machines in the gangster's rec room. When Kirk plays Calvinball with the cards appears to be when the episode just full on embraces the silliness and becomes an outright comedy. On the one hand I was a little miffed at the potentially serious side of the story which illustrates the importance of the prime directive being forgotten, but what we get is funny enough that I forgive it.

""What are the odds of getting a royal fizbin?""

""I've never computed them captain.""

Elements such as Jojo Krako's ""boss"" plaque and his dartboard of Okmyx make it clear that the show is in on the joke. I was laughing out loud when Spock and Kirk make the scene fully decked out as gangsters, and it's side splitting how ""Koik"" gradually turns into Edward G Robinson with ""Spocko"" reluctantly getting on the act (""I advise yas to keep diallin'"") and I was rolling in the aisles when he accidentally sends the car into reverse. It's great that legendary starship captain James T Kirk doesn't know how to drive. Even Scotty gets to threaten to put someone in concrete galoshes. Things just get nuttier and nuttier in this one.

The coda at the end of the episode even ties up the loose ends, as I was just thinking that how Kirk left things was irresponsible. I'm cutting myself short here - there's lots of other fun little moments I could type up but I won't be able to do them justice. A really pleasant surprise - when I realised what this episode was doing I was afraid it was going to be embarrassing but I couldn't have been more wrong.

startrek,"Hi! I know this is out of the blue, but I asked Alexa for an easter egg and she gave me ""If you and Worf are playing bingo, you might ask me this to learn his lingo"". Apparently Worf is a Star Trek character, but I have no idea what the answer is. I've been looking all over Google and can't seem to find an answer to her riddle, and I need to know what the answer is. Anyone know what it might be? Thank you!

Edit: It's not a matter of translating.

Edit two: I'm almost certain it's either a ST quote, a pun based off a ST quote or a bingo phrase with a ST-based pun. She said ""You might ask me this to learn his lingo"", so it's probably a bingo related question but with a Star Trek twist? It's frustrating, but I'm trying everything you guys are giving, and all she seems to do is direct me to wikipedia or duolingo.

startrek,"Now I haven't watched all the movies yet so don't spoil those for me please lol

Ok so I think I just have to share a bit of my thoughts and confusions

- I ended on the original series, now I liked the ending but it didn't really feel like a finale it felt more of just a normal episode which is wierd

- everyone I know that has watched a lot of star trek and I am just curious why most people don't like enterprise, like it's not my favorite or anything but I enjoyed it but most people seem to just be content with it and I can't seem to figure out why

- I think Voyager might have been my favorite but I don't know for sure I really liked them all

- the ending of Voyager was very strange as they got back to earth and that was it and the show ended right then and there with no like epilogue I guess, like what happened to everyone?

- I really liked ds9 as it felt different since it was on a station instead of a ship

- I have absolutely no complaints about TNG I really enjoyed it but it didn't seem to have a big overarching story that was shown a lot (I like big stories because they make me feel like there is something being built up to like I'm Voyager) but I did like all the episodes by themselves and it seems like a great show to just turn on anytime on any episode and pick up in the plot easily

- I doubt there is an explanation for this but why did kayless in the original series show up as a genetically altered Klingon?

Ok I have more thoughts that I can't think of as I am bad at writing my opinions well, I haven't been on this sub long so I don't know if is should make a post like this. Also I wierd thing I noticed was that all of these shows were aired before I was born except near the end of Enterprise (I'm only 15)

I'd love to hear what you all have to think about all this and I wanna know if Discovery and Picard are worth watching so I can know if I should try to get all access or not

But on the other hand she does seem like a better actor (Atleast for the first 1-2 seasons), but maybe that would only show on TNG bc of the circumstances (ie being on a Galaxy Class ship VS dealing with the myriad of non-federation factions from the deck of a space station).

startrek,"Noob Trek 44 - The Trouble With Tribbles

I know this episode! At least I know it's premise. I don't know \*how\* I know this - I've certainly never seen it before as I had seen no Trek before beginning this marathon - but I knew the basic story before watching it, that the Enterprise becomes overrun with a bunch of seemingly harmless fluffballs called Tribbles that breed lightning fast. Racking my brain, I \*think\* I'm aware of this because I was a huge fan of Gremlins, and this was cited as an influence on that.

I love the misdirection at the beginning. This entire episode is a bait and switch - we're lead to expect a confrontation with the klingons, with a whole bunch of politics and protocol and posturing upfront. Kind of like I Mudd, which has a dry opening before becoming very silly indeed, this also goes for a gradual and entirely deliberate 180 in tone. The gag is of course that the silly little tribbles come closer to causing mission failure on the part of Kirk than the aggressive warlike Klingons ever have. The I Mudd comparisons are Apt - this in fact feels like a Mudd episode. I wouldn't be surprised if it was written as one and Carmel was unavailable or something, Cyrano feels like a Mudd stand in. I don't mind Stanley Adamas as Cyrano, he's fine, and does well in the bar fight scene as he amusingly enjoys his drinks while everything goes to hell around him, but I think Carmel might have done it even better.

I recognize Trelane, William Campbell from Squire Of Gothos immediately. Much as I like Campbell though, he feels miscast as a Klington, much too arch and spry. It would have been nice to bring back Kor from Errand Of Mercy and have Kor and Mudd team up and possibly have their own spin off together. In fact, to my surprise, the Klingons seem to be getting \*less\* like the klingons I know with each appearance. In Errand Of Mercy they had makeup and more of a sense of an alien culture, in Friday's Child they just looked like people and now in The Trouble With Tribbles they look like people and behave a lot like them too. I suppose the lack of makeup is actually a plot point here for Darvin to pass as a human, but still, I like my Klingons like I like my coffee - not closely resembling a human being.

This episode is absolutely packed with quotable lines, so many I don't think I can even list them all.  ""My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee"" stands out. A lot of them come from Kirk squaring off with Baris - something about Baris just rubs Kirk the wrong way - maybe because he's a bureaucrat who doesn't appreciate the military wing of Starfleet and thinks it is just there to serve him. In any event, Kirk suddenly transforms into a class clown, firing off zingers every time Baris appears on the screen. Kirk doesn't have all the laughs though, one of my favourite moments was Spock boasting of how Vulcans are immune to the charms of tribbles as he begins to stroke one. I also loved how Scotty didn't mind all the insults about Kirk, but as soon as someone has a go at his ship he's ready to fight. ""I'm sorry, the Enterprise shouldn't tow garbage, it should be towed as garbage"" was pretty good too. This also leads into the interesting sight of Kirk dressing down his men for a ""small disturbance"" and leads into this classic exchange:

Scotty: They said you were an overbearing swaggering dictator with illusions of godhood.

Kirk: Is that all?

Other favourite moments are Kirk sitting on the tribble in his command chair, and of course what I now know to the iconic scene of Kirk becoming buried in tribbles. It's not dwelt on as this is a humorous story, but it was nice to see a serious side brought in, as there are ecological undercurrents to Spock explaining to Cyrano the dangers of removing animals from their natural habitats. If Spock is correct though, that means the tribbles live on a badass planet where they get killed all the time - do we ever go there?

Gripes? No shot of Campbell on the klingon ship overrun with tribbles, boo, I really wanted that. Also it's a bit slow - things like the barfight and dressing down, while entertaining, seemed to run long and there wasn't as much tribble insanity as I wanted - this may be due to the tribbles needing to be stationary for production reasons, so when they're just lying there they can't do that much. Finally, is Baris right? Didn't Kirk actually goof up by letting grain get destroyed? That it's poisoned is beside the point, Kirk still failed to defend it despite him knowing that tribbles were about.

However, I still really liked it, plenty of laugh out loud moments, and unlike I Mudd which was just nuts, this has a decent stab at combining a regular, sober Star Trek setting/story with the wacky hi-jinks, giving it a different sort of flavour which I appreciated. I hope we see the tribbles again soon!","""The Trouble With Tribbles"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
startrek,"I mean they literally send the Enterprise to negotiate every dispute at the neutral zone, even though any one of them could result in a full scale war. How incompetent can Starfleet be? Yeah it's the most advanced ship but they're putting families and children in unnecessary danger. I know a lot of the plotholes with regards to this have been pointed out before and most are chalked up to Starfleet's hubris, but there's a fine line between hubris and utter idiocy and Starfleet must have discovered transwarp a couple years early to get as far past that line as they did. It also reflects really poorly on the crew.


For example in the Descent two patter Beverly acting as captain flys the Enterprise into a sun, A SUN! Without knowing if the expirimental shielding will hold, it's okay to take a risk like this if your on a ship with your own crew, but if there are children aboard with their families, it's the type of risk you shouldn't really be taking.


I just needed to get this off my chest. I know the writers have said that they regret that aspect of the Enterprise D but damn, they basically avoid the semantics of it in every episode until they decide they need it as a plot device.


Thinking about this does however add a lot of weight to some of the decisions made in the show. For example at the end of 'Best of Both Worlds', right before Data is about to free Picard from the Collective, Riker is about to warp the Enterprise into the Borg Cube to ensure the safety of humanity. It seems like this really big decision when you realise he's about to sacrifice his whole crew to save humanity. But it shows he's got some iron clad balls when you realise he's about to sacrifice every innocent civilian on the Enterprise and in the circumstances its unfortunately probably the right decision.


But yeah, Starfleet are idiots.",Just a reminder that

""Who Watches the Watchers"" is becoming one of my favorite episodes; I find the scenes between Picard and Nuria very moving. The plot bears some thematic similarity to the poignance of Galaxy Quest.

&amp;nbsp;

On my most recent watch, I noticed that there are a few strange parallels between Ray Wise's character, Liko, and his character on Twin Peaks, Leland Palmer. Beyond the minor sound-similarity of the names, both characters interact with otherworldly beings and experience inexplicable and seemingly supernatural events, which change their lives and make them stand apart in their communities. Liko's only relative is his daughter, and he mourns his late wife, obsessing over Picard's power to revive the dead, while Leland obsessively mourns his dead daughter. What's more, in TNG there's a lot of hubbub about the stranded anthropologist, ""Palmer,"" (cf. the Palmer family) whom Liko heard Picard mention in his experience in Enterprise sickbay. 

&amp;nbsp;

The episode aired on October 6th, 1989. Twin Peaks premiered on April 8th, 1990.

startrek,"S1E7 - Justice

I thought this episode was sort of boring. Not too much happened. But let’s get to it. 

If a world or situation seems too good to be true, it probably is. Thankfully Picard seemed aware of that right off the bat when dealing with Edo. 

There was a lot of discussion about the Edo people including their social practices but they left out the most important thing somehow in their studies because they didn’t learn about their punishment? It doesn’t really make sense that they wouldn’t know about their capital punishment policy. Also they were talking about sexual these Edo people are and yet they still send Wesley who is immediately overwhelmed and gets himself in trouble.

What are the benefits to their idea that any one who commits any crime is executed? Well it saves costs on the justice system and prisons I suppose. Edo’s entire justice system is apparently two Mediators running up to you and slipping you some night-night juice. Quick and easy. On the downside, it’s incredibly unfair. 

That had to be quite the amazing experience for the girl from Edo to be able to see her God up close. I’m surprised she was even able to speak. 

Also I had an alternative solution for the Enterprise to use. Why not dress up one of crew as their “God” in human form. Maybe Geordi in disguise could do this. Then just beam him down and demand the release of Wes?

Overall, I felt the message of the episode was summarized well by Riker at the end: “When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?”. This is why each situation is handled case-by-case and not every outcome will be the same.",Star Trek TNG S1E7 Discussion

startrek,"Even though I’m new to the universe I’ve heard at or around 4 is when the show really kicks in to gear. But honestly what the actual f*** is going on before then? TNG had a reason for not being serialized and I suppose at least in the beginning DS9 needed to get everything set up before but by mid season 2 we know the characters and what’s going on. So WHAT THE F*** IS GOING ON?! 

Just watched episodes 14-16 of season 2 and they’re so disconnected and leave so many questions unanswered that I feel are kinda important to the story or at least to character development. 14 is when Bashir and O’Brian are supposedly killed in a planets attempt to stop civil war and they know about some bioweapon. 15 is when O’Brian is running from the station because everyone is acting weird. And 16 I’m in the middle of but just from the first few minutes I’m once again just like what the hell! 

Are the people from episode 14 coming back since Bashir and Brian were rescued by Sisko? They were adamant on killing them, even Sisko, because they know too much. Would they attack the station and start a war with the federation?

Episode 15 who are the Paradons, sorry if that’s spelled wrong, and how did Brian end up with the rebels? What happened when he was with the actual government? What are the rebels rebelling against? Were they negotiating peace with the rebels or another species? What about the rebels makes them more appropriate allies than the government? 

Episode 16 they just ignore everything that happened in the previous ones. Sure the Brian in the last episode was a “replicant” so anything that happened that we saw was not the actual perspective but still it seemed like everyone was against Brian and then boom this episode everything is just fine. 

I get it I do, none of that happened, and with the benefit of Netflix we don’t need to wait a week and that means no real disconnect that didn’t exist when the episode released. It’s still just so frustrating. We’re just supposed to accept that everything happened but also has no lasting impact on anything or anyone.

All that would of had to happen is the doctor instantly getting to work to keep them all from mutating. But is that really all thy hard? It seems clear in the episode that the longer you wait to treat it the more effort it takes but it’s never impossible. And once they are safe in earth orbit they can use the dozens of ship warp cores to quickly treat everyone and then there’s nothing else to worry about it.  So i see no reason why they wouldn’t use it if it works.,Why wasent warp 10 a usable way home for voyager?
startrek,"Picard season one was, in my opinion, pretty damn good. My only complaint with it would be just how focused it was on the concept of AI, while I agree that AI is something that people need to start talking about  the story itself wasn’t very Star Trek centric and I don’t feel that it properly explored Star Treks vast pre-existing universe. I don’t mind pre-existing lore not being the center of a Star Trek Story as I don’t think Star Trek should be an exclusionary lore circle-jerk, but I do want to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe. 


With Picard de-canonizing almost all of the lore for what’s happened after nemesis by its very nature, I’d love to get to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe, particularly what’s going on with some of the DS9 centric powers. I’d love to get to see Star Trek Picard season 2 show us a Bajor that’s either parted ways with the federation or straight out joined it, or a democratic Cardassia. What about the rest of the Romulan people, obviously some sort of government exists if the tal-shiar and Zhat-Vash still exist, what’s that like?

&amp;nbsp;  
William Shatner has been the butt of many jokes over the years, and has gained.. a.. certain reputation........ for his style, but look at the era and his background.   
&amp;nbsp;  
TOS was hot off the heals of so many classic dramatic and adventure films, and seems to have taken inspiration from a lot of the myth and epic movies before it, like *Jason and the Argonauts*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Hercules*.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Now when people ask me about Star Trek recommendations, I always tell them to imagine it is a stage play. This seems to contextualize the exaggerated acting and situations that seem a little more unorthodox, even for a Trek series (like actually meeting the Greek gods).    
&amp;nbsp;  
Not that it should matter, but this approach has really seemed to gain the series some respect, from *my* friends at least.

In season 6 episode 15, Picard is mortally wounded and would have most likely died, but Q intervenes and uses the moment to teach him a lesson and open his mind (by creating the time paradox), just like he tries to open his mind in the show finale. If Q had not sent Picard back in time in that moment, we already know that Picard would have lived a much less exciting life, he was only propelled into his destiny as a legendary captain because of Q's intervention. Plus Q probably made sure he didn't die from that blast as well.

Some interesting character development in this episode. I’m looking forward to these more and more every day. 

Worf showed himself to be eager to learn when he was shadowing Geordi. Seems like he’s ambitious. He’s currently a Junior Lieutenant. We shall watch his career with great interest.  

We discovered that the Enterprise crew does not eat meat! I suppose that makes sense. Where would they keep the animals? Also on the topic of food, it was interesting to hear discussion about accommodating dietary requirements for the aliens that are visiting your ship. 

When the ship ‘malfunctioned’, Data says it’s a near impossible chance of this happening (from normal wear and tear). Good to know how good Star Fleet engineering is. Systems just do not fail on their own. 

As I side note I really liked the design of the Anticans. Haven’t seen them before. 

The discussion about private eyes and detective work was fun. Each episode of Star Trek is a mystery! That’s part of why we all tune in. Also Detective Data is my favorite Data so far.

Worf taking away Kurn's identity and memory was an awful way for that storyline to end, imo. Not only was it not honorable, it was basically saying that there was no way for Kurn to get out of his current predicament, which I feel was a bad message.

startrek," Full spoilers ahead for Picard.

They had five full movies worth of run time for Picard and I don't think they satisfyingly developed a single character in this supposedly character driven show. Narek and Soji bang within about five minutes of meeting on the cube and despite liking to have sex with each other being just about all they seem to have in common, I guess Narek loves her by episode five which couldn't be more than a couple of weeks in their time assuming the first time we see Soji at the end of episode one is when Picard sets off to find her.

How they introduced Raffi feels a lot like how Mr Poopeybutthole is shown to apparently have been a real character that participated in past events in Rick and Morty. I get that it makes sense that there would be people Picard would have met in the past couple of decades, but that level of chuminess and amount of inferred history really felt awkward to me for a character we'd never seen before. That quickly glossed over backstory coupled with how quickly they also introduce Raffi's son and move past it and then her very sudden apparent relationship with 7 makes it feel almost like parody levels of ridiculous.

The evil Soji/Dajh character at the end with the Data skin I felt must have had about ten total minutes of screen time(maybe it was more, I think my eyes glazed over and I lost all sense of reality at multiple points watching this show) and yet she ends up being one of the most important antagonists. These synthetics are apparently insanely intelligent and her most of all considering she just randomly deduced that the warning to biological organisms might actually be a message to synthetics and had the ability to mind meld, but she wasn't smart enough to avoid being recorded stabbing her sister.

Agnes is so affected by what she saw through the mind meld that she murders the person she loves most in this world and then later in the series gambles that the synthetics will do the right thing and not genocide all life in the galaxy and helps to save them instead. I guess you could say her speaking to Soji for five minutes that one time could've helped change her mind, but it still seems strange that a character would do such a distinct 180.

There's hardly a real arc for anyone and what arcs there are make little sense or I just find fairly boring. Soji, a few days after finding out she's an android, wants to bring about armageddon for organic life, but then decides not to because I guess Picard was cool to her. Agnes flip flops like I mentioned before between being horrified enough to murder and then potentially making that murder pointless a few days later. Rios is depressed about the incident with the other synthetics and his captain's suicide and then I guess gets over it? No one else really has a significant arc of any kind that I can remember. Elnor starts off as a comic relief ninja and ends that way. 7 starts off as a now nihilistically mooded fanservice Mary Sue and ends that way. Narissa starts off as the wicked witch of the cube and ends that way(well she ends up supposedly dead, but she'll probably be back in season 2 considering we don't see her die as far as I remember). I guess Picard learned to express himself more?

I understand full well why people here really want to like this show. I very much wanted to as well and really did try up until a little past halfway through and while there are technical aspects to like(minus the stock footage), I don't see how anyone can really claim that the creators of this series had a firm grasp on what people want out of Star Trek or competent storytelling in general. Now I expect very much to get flamed here because I know people here did genuinely enjoy this first season and are getting really tired of people like me, and so I just ask that you tell me what it is that you enjoyed about it if you're in that camp. It might be that in a few years I look back and think I was too harsh on the show.

I enjoyed this episode! It gave us more good development, an intriguing storyline and some philosophy. Let’s dig in. 

Kosinski keeps saying he’s got everything approved from star fleet commmand. Is there no way for the Enterprise to verify that? Who does the Enterprise get their orders from?

Last episode we Geordi so excited to go Warp 9, which made me think it was the fastest the ship could go. Turns out it wasn’t. They broke the all-time speed record by going “over warp 10”. It feels nice to witness some Star Trek history. 

There was some interesting philosophical discussions about time, space, and thought all being the same thing. It’s an interesting concept that I can’t say I’ve thought of before. Only issue is space is tangible. We’ve been there. It’s unlike the other two in that way. Not sure where I’m going with that, but there’s a discussion in there somewhere. 

We got shown more of Yar’s rape gang backstory. Apparently she stopped for a cat while running from one of those gangs? I mean, okay? On the flip side there was a nice moment with Picard and his mom. It seemed like they had a good relationship. 

There was certainly an urge at first to explore but I thought Picard shut it down perfectly and logically. The interaction was something along the lines of: “So many opportunities for new studies!” “But who would we report our findings to?”

I really liked how they handled Wesley’s promotion. Having the alien tell Picard he really is a savant but that he needs time to learn is a solid way to justify promoting such a young kid. So now we have Wesley, Acting Ensign, who has an opportunity to become permanent, which is cool. 

Felt like the overall theme of the episode was that when we all work together towards a common goal we can break records. We can accomplish great things as a team. Picard got everyone on the ship to focus on The Traveler and getting them home and because of that they were able to return.",Star Trek TNG S1E5 Discussion

startrek,"Somehow I missed this episode when it first aired on TV. I just watched it on Amazon Prime this evening.

This is one of the few VOY episodes I can remember that actually has any moral complexity. We've seen a lot of variations of 'shipwrecked survivors found stranded on a planet' in Star Trek, but them being ex-Borg is a nice touch. 

The Cooperative puppeteer Chakotay to go to the damaged Borg cube and restart their link. They violate his autonomy; however, it could be argued it was an extreme circumstance as their rivals were literally beating down their doors to kill them.

On the other hand, Janeway has some good points about why they shouldn't assist the Cooperative in their plans. Firstly, assisting ex-Borg to form their own collective is just hinky. There is no indication that the other stranded ex-Borg on the planet even wanted to collectivize. Then again, if they don't, they all seem hellbent on destroying one another. Janeway's point about the restarted Borg cube possibly summoning other Borg cubes is a good point; one can only hope the Cooperative was able to block the Borg on it from signalling the other Borg. I mean, we have no proof they can do that, but maybe? Otherwise, all they would've accomplished was to bring the Borg right back to them, so I suppose they had thought of that and had a way to stop those Borg.

Also, exploding the Borg cube is basically murder, especially as we know those drones could be disconnected from the collective and reestablish their own identities, just like the colonists on the planet. However, it's arguably necessary to destroy them to prevent them from assimilating and/or destroying Voyager and the colonists.

It would be interesting to see what became of this Cooperative. If they make it to a second generation (and I don't see why not; there's an episode where the Doctor notes Seven is still fertile, implying the Borg don't sterilize their drones) their children won't have the implants necessary for the link. Will they still maintain their idyllic little hippie oneness colony? 

Out of the aliens in the episode, aside from Orum (Romulan) and Frazier (human), one of the Cooperative has facial ridges just like Archer's great-granddaughter in that ""E2"" episode. Is she Ikaaran? One of the attackers seems to be a Nausicaan. The others may be exotic Delta Quadrant species I'm unfamiliar with.","VOY: ""Unity"""
startrek,"For starters I’ll just say this might become quite a long post, and I know the new films are incredibly divisive, but that just means you get a better debate and comparing of ideas out of them so I’m looking forward to the comments on this and what thoughts people have on them.

Anyway, Picard has got me in a very Trek-y mood lately so I’ve been watching all the movies, most are re-watches but a couple for the first time. Naturally I ended up at what I’ll call the Kelvin films. I was born in 98 so these are the only Trek movies I was able to watch at the cinema, but I’m a big Trek fan and have been for as long as I can remember. 

I’m just going to say now I really like Star Trek 09 and Star Trek Beyond. Trek 09 was a really clever way to re-tell the story of the original crew of the Enterprise and the way it doesn’t obliterate the entire cannon by just starting again was a good choice on its part. (I know it does start most things over again but it’s an alternate realty so you get my point) And as for Beyond, I think I can honestly say it’s tied with First Contact for my favourite Trek movie. You can feel the love Simon Pegg has for it in his script and it just feels the most like Star Trek out of the new batch. It’s one of what I call my ‘happy films’. I just bloody love it. 

But man, Into Darkness...exists, I guess.

The 09 movie went so far out of its way to separate itself from Trek stories that had already been told just for them to come back to Khan. I guess at the very least we have something to point to as the moment JJ Abrams started remaking old movies instead of thinking up new ideas, because he did exactly the same with the Star Wars sequels. I know Khan is probably Trek’s most well known villain, but he’s by far the weakest part of this film. 

I’ll give the movie this, the morally grey stuff between Kirk, Marcus and Khan is good. I really enjoy a bit of throwing morally grey stuff into things, it just makes them a lot more interesting. But the rest of the film is average at best and it’s the only one of the new batch that I tend to agree with people who have more negative views of them. It’s such a lazy retelling and all of the tension between Khan and Kirk is lost because they don’t have that shared history they did in the original version. In this Kirk is more of a minor inconvenience to Khan than his sworn enemy, and that really takes away from the film.

Also I’d like to know how someone who was around before the timeline diverged went from hispanic to the most English guy to ever exist. I know Benedict Cumberbatch was, and still is, a huge name, but if prime timeline Klingon ships are shown in the Kobyashi Maru test in Trek 09 surely Khan can keep his race/ethnicity in this?

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the Kelvin films, nothing new but I have Reddit now some at least I can write them down. I know they’re not everyone’s cup of Earl Grey tea, but for the 2/3 majority I for one really enjoy them, especially Beyond. But yeah...Into Darkness...really not the best",Just some thoughts on the Kelvin movies

Geordi was so excited about hitting warp 9. What a letdown. Is that the fastest a ship can go?

The Enterprise crew has been coming across as so weak. Bowing to the orders or two different leaders in a row. Then Riker, Geordi, and Data all get smoked once they land on the planet. They sort of addressed it at the end when discussing with the empire leader about their philosophy. 

The Ferengi were 200 years behind us in culture but their weapons are stronger than ours? Also more sexist aliens when it comes to Yar. Again already?

startrek,"So after binging through TNG, VOY and DS9 for the very first time and I just finished ""What You Leave Behind"". I know stuff like this get's posted **a lot** and no one really cares about my opinion, but I wanted to share my thoughts anyway.

Firstly I think I have to say I'm not a big Star Trek nerd. I watched the old (Kirk) movies as a kid and really liked them but that's about it. I've seen the 2009 film and thought it was okay, same with Into Darkness (haven't seen Beyond yet), but I didn't really had any interest in watching the ST series, until I started watching Discovery when the second season came out in germany (and I'm sorry but I love it). When the first trailer for Picard came out I finally deccided to give TNG on Netflix a try but it took me about half a year or so to get through the first two seasons before I started binging the rest of TNG (including movies), VOY and then DS9.
I think every series had many highs and sadly also many lows (weird sex with a ghost comes to mind) and a lot of stuff that was kinda cool but nothing special either, but in the end I really liked all three of them. I want to make clear, this is not a *hate* post and I truly enjoyed watching DS9 for the most part (in some episodes it's better then anything TNG and VOY ever put out).

But let's get to the point... I know this is a very unpoular opinion but I did not enjoy ""What You Leave Behind"" almost at all. I heard a lot about this being the best final episode of all the series, but I must admit I don't feel the same.

Firstly I hated how the dominion war just ended like that with part one and the second part just focused on the prophet and the Pah-wraith stuff... And with that I also have to admit I was not a fan of this stuff from the very beginning and I didn't really enjoy most of the episodes centering around this religious stuff (like when the prophets just made the Dominion reinforcments disappear like the biggest dues ex machina). I sometime felt like watching Supernatural in space with the prophets beeing the angels and the pah-wraiths beeing the demons (even till the point of them possessing people and the red eys). And what about Sisko? Is he dead? Is he a prophet now who lives in the wormhole? I thought that was not just a little bit weird. Imo this all felt very fantasy and not very sci-fi at all (even tho I **LOVE** fantasy even more then sci-fi). I don't mind a little weirdnes in sci-fi and Star Trek always had this (Q is the fucking best) but I never thought that that kinda stuff should be one of the main themes of a series.

And then you have the epilog with these super cheesy flashbacks... This maybe worked better back when it aired, especially if you didn't just watched all seven seasons in about a month, but I kinda just rolled my eyes at this. The simple moment, when Picard joined the rest of the crew at poker, had me in tears, but this just didn't really click with me at all. (I know the reasoning behind it and can't put blame on anyone, but with Jadzia beeing left out of the memorys this all just felt kinda wrong, especially with Worfs flashbacks) 

Don't get me wrong, I would prefer the flashbacks over the strange sudden ending of Voyager any time, but I don't really get the praise this finally gets.

Now please tell me why I'm wrong, while I start watching Picard. I'm one of those people who absolutly loved Star Wars the Last Jedi and I also love DIS, think section 31 is nice concept and don't really like some of the utopian stuff about the Federation, so maybe I just have strange taste.

tl;dr: I did not like the DS9 finale",Finally finished DS9 [SPOILERS]

This might be a weird thing to take away from Trek, and an even weirder thing to talk about here, but with my recent watch through of all of the Trek series on netflix I've found a sense of acceptance in my identity.  
 I've identified as an Asexual (and ~~probably~~ Bi-romantic) for a bit, but watching Trek has just made me feel more comfortable with that part of myself myself.  
   
All of the characters are valuable to Starfleet without considering their sexuality, Data for instance is as close to a confirmed Ace as we get, and my personal favorite because of his relate-ability to me... even though I have to ignore the whole ""fully functioning"" thing in The Naked Now.    
Then there's Spock, who debatably also expresses some asexual leanings.   
lastly Jadzia being an example of a Pan-sexual, (Confirmed by Terry Farrell herself!) female presenting, gender fluid person makes me unbelievably happy! There are moments that it comes through, but I honestly see them as funny rather than anything which pulls me out of the show like they would in others. I think of the Ferengi Oo-Mox ritual as a good example, that's just hilarious to me whenever it happens because it kinda mirrors how alienated I feel from sex stuff.

Many people don't like the Bajoran politic episodes, and this isn't one of DS9's best but I have a soft spot for episodes like this.  Louise Fletcher as Kai Winn is so wonderful and as I was watching I was thinking about how much she brought to the show.

One loose end I was wondering about was Kubus. The episode didn't resolve whether he was able to go to Bajor after all. Winn no longer had use for him after becoming Kai so maybe she withdrew her offer of sanctuary. On the other hand, Kira learning about what Opaka did - what she felt she *had* to do - could have given her a different view on collaborators like Kubus similar to how she changed her feelings in Duet.  Still, I don't think Kubus ended up on Bajor. What do you think happened?",DS9 - The Collaborator
startrek,"After seeing “The Inner Light” I’ve found that many consider it one of the best episodes ever. Fortunately for me, I had no idea about that and got to enjoy the episode with no inkling what I had in store. Picard having to experience an entire, full life, and realize everyone he grew to know and love in that life had been gone for many years, and he is now the only remnants of an entire civilization really had an impact on me.

A few episodes later, I watched “Relics” right before going to bed. Again, no idea what I was about to see. When Scotty showed up, I thought it would be a nice episode for nostalgia as I absolutely love TOS, watched it repeatedly as a kid, and only recently even gave TNG a chance (I’m so glad I did).  But showing Scotty grasp with the ideas that he was no longer the expert of the Enterprise, that all he knew and cared about were gone, and at the end of the day was no longer useful and quite honestly in the way struck a different nerve with me. Without too many details I am reaching the end of my own military career, and while not nearly as outcast as Mr. Scott, technology is definitely making me feel like a dinosaur.

Those episodes were a lot to take in on one day (among the others in between those). I’m so grateful I didn’t know what was coming and still don’t for the rest of the series. Few shows actually make me emotional, but TNG sure has.  I care very much about this ship and crew and I’m so thankful for it.

startrek,"The two most likely games would be either a strategy game like “Birth of the Federation” or for a more modern equivalent, “Stellaris” 

Or.....

A L.A noire type game, with you going around solving problems, and having an overarching plot in the background. 

However, a lot of the old games have fallen into obscurity. Conquest was interesting but it has some major lacking and came out around the end of the lifespan of the PS2 and the Wii. Legacy, while I think it’s good, could have been better and was disappointing for the 30th anniversary(in my opinion). You had Birth of the Federation, but it only had the Next Gen era, but otherwise was good, just kinda overshadowed by other games. We recently had Bridge crew, but that fell into obscurity, and I haven’t heard anything about it in a while. Stage 9 was shut down by cbs. And then we have STO. I would say, it’s a decent game. However, I don’t feel like it is the game should be the pinnacle of Star Trek games. It is a MMO rpg, mostly focused on action and any character choices are mute. Most of the game’s content is locked behind Zen, which is just a paywall. While you can access the story and have fun, it doesn’t feel rewarding after you get to level 40, and if you don’t want to pay money, you can grind for days to get dilithium that will then convert into a negligible amount of Zen.

Were these just not made so they could cram in another 30 secs of ads or was this just not done for the DVDs so someone could piss me off.

Voyager certainly did in it's pilot but not nearly as well.  TNG did it with Q but again, not as intelligently.  Q was a great character but he was a foil for Picard played mostly for comedy relief.

'The Cage' gets best episode because it's intelligence was so far ahead of it's time.  It's aliens didn't mask themselves as human, but manipulated humans with their artifice.

startrek,The situation on AR 558 annoys me.  The defiant is sent to resupply their people there.  Who apparently are on the brink of insanity because of the war.  But what really bothers me is how poorly defended their settlement was.  Their technology is superior in a lot of ways compared to the dominion.  Why didn't they set up holo emitters to create holographic soldiers to defend the area.  The dominion is smart enough to use holograms.  When the jem'hadar showed up why did they not set their phasers to wide beam.  Why didn't they use drones and artificial satellites in orbit to observe the jem'hadar.  Instead of sending people on a suicide mission.  So AR-558 is just another example of starfleet getting people killed because of incompetence.  They had the resources and the technology to hold back the jem'hadar and keep casualties to a minimum.  But they didn't use them.  I find this very annoying.

startrek,"S1E3 - Code of Honor

Overall, I thought this was a pretty weak episode. Lutan was so obviously a bad guy and the Star Fleet crew just came across as weak the whole time. My commentary below. 

So their first mistake was letting Yar go to the matrix room alone. Like yeah they all agreed she could go but I don’t remember them saying it had to be only her. And oh look, she got taken. Surprise. 

Weird that Wesley got a spot on the deck. Riker called it temporary, but we’ll see. Wanted him to earn it longer. 

Wow this fight to the death is straight out of Black Panther. I’m assuming the comics are older? Not sure. 

Oh and the fight is professional tag to the death. Gotta be some inspiration there. Lol

I was really intrigued by Picard’s rant about what happened to Earth! But then he cut it off in a nod to old fans saying “everyone knows that story”. Will I learn this story from the show or should I look up other source material??

Also Geordi trying to run out of the room because he’s heard 661 of Data’s jokes and can’t take another was fantastic. 😂",Star Trek TNG S1E3 Discussion
startrek,"Bit of a rant here (who am I kidding - it's a lot of a rant), but I just finished the show and, while it was entertaining, I would even call it good - I have to say - it just doesn't feel like Star Trek. At all. And I don't mean the constant action and brawls every episode - though of course, those contribute - but it's like Picard just forgot what Star Trek was about.

From the get go, we have a Federation that just... sucks. The Federation has been victim to sabotage by the Romulans, sure - but nonetheless, it's a broken, racist Federation, nothing like the one we know. Picard is a bitter old man living a quiet life in a shell of the Federation he once knew.

And sure, we had Deep Space 9, often considered the best Trek, making the Federation 'dark', and exposing corruption within the system, but no matter how dark DS9 got, it had a shining, very moralized crew to show the audience that there was still hope for good, no matter how broken the system was. Picard... doesn't have that. Picard has a bunch of bitter, broken people struggling within a demoralized Federation.

And besides that, Star Trek was always a very transhumanist show - from that episode back in TOS about transcended beings, to Wesley's ascension in TNG (yes, I know, we all hated it), Star Trek was always about going boldly forward - even Q was afraid of what humanity might become in the future, and that's saying something.

So the ending of Picard especially just felt... disappointing. Why does Data need to die to truly experience life? Why is Picard going to squander the opportunity of a \*new body\* on living out as a dying old man? Instead of the transhumanism that Star Trek has \*always\* purveyed, we've been given a fairy tale moral about how life wouldn't be valuable with death. It feels hollow and nonsensical. If you want to die, then die - but there's really no reason to live out your last few days in an increasingly decrepit body for that sake.

On top of that, the synthetic life versus organic life motif seemed a little bit... uninspired. First of all, is anyone getting Mass Effect vibes? And second of all, in an, again, transhumanist show, the implication that synthetic life is completely different and superior to organic life, and that there's no way for the two to work together (or, god forbid, exist as one) seems to lack vision to me. We've seen the 'AI will evolve and destroy all life' plot a hundred times before and it's not quite as compelling in a show about going forward - Picard himself says that fear is no way to live.",[Picard Spoilers] Does anyone else feel like Picard just... forgot to be Star Trek?
startrek,I've been binge watching enterprise.  They really were unprepared for the dangers of deep space.  They launched without all of their defenses.  They don't have a tractor beam or shields.  If it doesn't have shields they could at least use ablative armor but they didn't even do that.  And I'm not sure about the reliability of their transporter.  Especially since it caused hallucinations in one episode.  This is not the kind of ship a sane person would want to take into deep space.  Let alone go looking for hostile aliens.  This is the starship equivalent of those old world war two fighters that were made out of wood.  You would almost have to have a death wish to want to serve on this ship.  So they obviously had no idea what was out there.  If it wasn't for plot armor this ship would probably have been in tiny pieces long before the end of the first season.  Oh and it's really slow.  Twenty fourth century ships are almost twenty times faster.  So it would have taken them months to travel more then a few dozen light years.  Which means that outrunning hostile aliens wouldn't be an option.  Especially since many of them had ships capable of warp seven.  So the NX class is a death trap.  Anyone serving on one might want to put their affairs in order before hand.  It's probably the most rickety ship in star trek.  So let me know what you think.,Enterprise was unprepared for deep space

startrek,"I don’t know how many people have paid attention or who are common on the subreddit so who would know I make semi constant posts every so often the last few months and that I’m pretty brand new to the universe. I don’t want to keep pointing that out but I know it’s necessary to give context for what I’m feeling and trying to say or get others feelings on. I’ve only completed TNG and maybe midway through season 2 of DS9 in the main timeline series.

Now with that context out of the way I’ve watched both Picard and Discovery on CBS and honestly I haven’t had much problems with them. Starfleet is sad and depressed in Picard but that made more or less sense in the context of the show and I didn’t mind. The characters in it are also still really well done. So I’m more positive on Picard as additional context. Then I just finished up Discovery and I honestly don’t see any problems with it. It’s going back to true space exploration and space stuff that I’m not getting in DS9 and Picard took awhile to get to and even then wasn’t interesting, in space. 

One of my former coworkers is a Trek fan and hates Discovery because of the politics of the show and that it’s not true Star Trek. With previous context I can’t say one way or another if it is or isn’t but I never got the feeling it was dishonest. I haven’t yet seen a Starfleet during real wartime so the section 31 stuff made sense, even though I do agree that maybe they went too far or shouldn’t have had as much power after the war. And the season 2 baddie being an AI that all of Starfleet uses for strategic analyses is literally the worst idea ever. 

The Discovery itself is such a badass looking ship with a really intriguing special thing about it, the spore drive. It looks so sleek and dare I say sexy AF. Enterprise D ain’t got nothing on it. E is close though. Sorry TOS Enterprise but a little to simple for me lol. The spore drive in and of itself is something so brand new and amazing that I can see why Starfleet would want to look into it. Being able to just drop in and out of anywhere whenever is such a huge strategic advantage it makes sense. And that scene where it’s just jumping all over the damn place around a Klingon ship, I think the ship of the dead(?), was so outstanding and something I had wanted to see I loved it so much. 

Just saw the season 3 trailer and honestly it didn’t grab me at all. But I just want to know what the general opinion is of Discovery, not Picard that was just for added context, and why it seems to be mostly negative. I will say I’m more excited to get back into TOS, barely in season 1 so hardly worth mentioning, because the sound and ship designs, while obviously futuristic, still sounded the same and from the times we saw the Enterprise could see the similarities between this generation and back in the 60s. 

Total side note not at all connected to the main points of this but my god is DS9 honestly really boring and slow. Again only season 2 so I know it gets better later but god is it taking forever I just want to skip ahead but I can’t because that’s not appropriate and I’m a completionist.",Just general feelings on Discovery from anyone else

I know that I wouldn't want to be beamed up anywhere, because the way I see it, teleport is just a fancy way of saying that someone was killed and a copy of them was made in another place.

I'm fine with many cultures accepting being beamed all the time, but even IRL I don't think there's any technology that everyone agrees it is ok. Some people are against blood transfusion, some people were against having their picture taken. And I imagine the First Directive would forbid the Starfleet beaming someone who opposed it on a cultural level.

startrek,"When I first watched the original series, I did so because I wanted view the franchise from the very beginning and while I enjoyed it immensely (It still has my all time favourite episode), I was always waiting to get to TNG.

It being the sixties I could understand why the characters never seemed to be that emotional and their attachment to each other always seemed so formal. (Except for Bones and Spock, of course).
I figured it was because back then, “men didn’t show emotion” and while there is definitely hints of that, I found myself disappointed that TNG seemed to be even more militaristic then in TOS. Everything seemed so formal and even the friendships took a back seat to politics and formalities. 

Now I’m not saying I hated TNG, in fact I’m going to do a rewatch after TOS, but I was disappointed in the direction they took StarFleet and the Federation as a whole. In TOS StarFleet was obviously based on the military, but they allowed for rule breaking and were more concerned about the “spirit of good”, rather then the fine print. 
 
Anyway back to my original point, as I’m rewatching the Original Series I’m becoming more and more aware of the personalities of all the characters, and though it focuses on the big three, as opposed to the more ensemble crew, the characters all seem so personable and deep. I could literally write an entire post about each of them.
 Kirk the StarFleet man through and through, who has to juggle his responsibilities and his ethics to save the crew, and occasionally save the universe.
 Spock constantly struggling to reconcile is two halves and it’s only until he dies, (and gets into the mind of McCoy) he manages to become more balanced. 
 Speaking of McCoy, what a fantastic character! Choosing ethics over orders and shows his true colours as the confidante and guide to Kirk.

As I’m going through I’m seeing a new side to each character and though there are elements that are dated, and certainly wouldn’t fly today, the show makes an incredible character study of three completely different people, who work so well together. Spock the brain, McCoy the heart and Kirk the body. Each different yet working together.

They were especially informal much of the time on DS9. Yet when Cadet Nog started his training they were super formal with him. Everything was ""yes sir"" ""no sir"" snap to attention, be a rigid soldier. 

That sort of thing makes sense for a modern military where the priority is training men and women to be capable of going into dangerous situations and killing on command. You want to break them down into a rigidly obedient individual. 

But Starfleet's mission is primarily a peaceful one, they're interested in exploration, scientific discovery, charting new planets, that suggests something different than a soldier's mindset. I wouldn't think a soldier would make a terribly good scientist.

Now I'm not saying they shouldn't have combat training. Obviously its part of their function to be able to fight. But it doesn't make sense to give them the full traditional military conditioning.

In Star Trek cannon have there every been encounters with supernatural elements and magic not explained in a scientific way?",Question in reference to Picard episode 8 and a general question about Star Trek cannon.
startrek,"I saw a few Redditors who wanted to prepare before watching Star Trek Picard so I made a (short) list. 

If you want to watch Picard you need background information for the story. This is a very short list but I think it covers most of the series. Its important that you watch these episodes and the movie. If you dont watch them you wont understand everything. (Especially if you are new to Star Trek) 

The Next Generation:

- Measure of a man (About Data and Bruce Maddox) 
- Unification 1 &amp; 2 (About Romulus, not very important but it gives some context) 
- Face of the enemy (About the Tal'Shiar) 
- I, borg (About Hugh) 
- Best of Both Worlds 1 &amp; 2 (About Picards history with the Borg) 
- The Offspring (About Data) 

Movies:

- Star Trek Nemesis (Very important for the story around Data) 

Voyager episodes:

- Scorpion 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg and Seven of Nine) 
- The Raven (About Seven of Nine) 
- Dark Frontier 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg) 
- Imperfection (Icheb) 

This is a very short list. There are probably more episodes which would help. But I think the episodes above are the most important to understand events prior to the Picard series.

If you think I forgot something please comment below.

Have fun watching!

startrek,"Watching this show has given me so much information! I'm watching TNG for the first time on Amazon Prime and regularly pause the episodes to Google search random facts and tidbits of information discussed on the show. Today, in this particular episode, Fermat's Last Theorem was discussed by Picard.  He stated that it was a mathematical equation that had been unsolved for nearly 800 years, and one that he regularly tinkered with because he found it to be ""stimulating"".

Cue the Google searching. I quickly found the link to the Wikipedia article on the equation, and was astonished that the equation had actually been proven in 1995, roughly 6 years after the aformentioned episode originally aired in 1989. I absolutely love finding stuff like this. Not only is this franchise entertaining, but somewhat educational and completely intriguing as well.","Fermat's Last Theorem, discussed in TNG S2E12, ""The Royale"""
startrek,"I'm about two thirds of the way through my rewatch of Deep Space Nine, and it strikes me how perfectly analogous the show is for today's culture of lockdowns and social distancing. Something that has struck me over the last month is, despite how rapidly our way of living has changed, we have all adjusted and adapted just as quickly to existing in the shadow of this new threat. 

Compare this to Deep Space Nine. Yes, the the threat of the Dominion perpetually hovers on the other side of the wormhole, but Quark still must carry on doing business, dealing with the usual Ferengi politics. Life on the station changes drastically, from Bajoran political upheaval, to hosting a permanent Klingon garrison, but Dax still continues the customs of her people by assessing a potential Trill host. While it can definitely be argued that this quality of the show is partly due to its episodic nature, the writers are not afraid to maintain the consequences of the changes and the upheaval of the status quo. Things don't just 'go back to normal'. Our characters must adapt and, importantly, continue with their daily lives, facing the Marquis or Jem'Hadar when they must, and coping with the fallout. 

On my daily walks it now feels perfectly natural to encounter face masks in, what always felt like, my safe corner of Britain. So do the empty shops and restaurants I pass. So does walking into the road to give others a two metre berth. And, like the characters of DS9 who experience a massive change over the course of 7 seasons, I can return back home and continue with my work and other aspects of my life without experiencing too much dissonance.

startrek,"I had been waiting until I had a chunk of time before getting the CBS free trial so I could watch Picard.  I was off this week from work because of COVID-19 stuff, so I thought I should watch it.  I was honesty nervous and not excited to watch it.  I hadn't read too many posts about it because I was afraid of spoilers, but I had read enough negative things to make me not sure I wanted to watch it.

I bit the bullet and watched it last week.  It was honestly a little sad, Patrick Stuart is getting old ad it was almost hard to watch because of that.  I am a HUGE Star Trek fan Jean-Luc has always been my favorite captain.  It's hard to watch actors you love get older, it really is.  It was also the least ""Star Trek"", Star Trek series I've ever seen.  It had the same species, same Federation, same bad guys, and some of the same people but it was very different.  

The plot was confusing and jumped around, the dialog was stiff and hard to understand at times.  I didn't find the plot engaging enough to fully pay attention too, I found myself easily distracted and didn't care enough about the show to rewind.  

What I did like was the reunion of the familiar characters.  It was fun to see Picard catch up with old crew members.  It was nice to see the familiar species Borg, Romulans, and androids.  

The season was only 10 episodes long and it all came together rather conveniently.  I am disappointed because they could have done so much more!  They had the time, money, and resources to make a really wonderful show and the kind of blew it.  They were never going to do justice to TNG but they could have done more than what they did.  

If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's still Star Trek and it's still Jean-Luc.  If there is a season 2 I hope they do a better job.  I may go back and watch season 1 again in a few months, maybe now that I know the plot and where it's going I'll like it better.",Picard---Spoiler Free

Q, of course.  Who else would exist so far out of the timeline that prophecy doesn't apply to him?

He disrupted the whole series of events by bringing the Borg into it.  That led to Hugh, which led to Descent, where Lore was ultimately defeated by Data before he could fulfill his role in the prophecy.

startrek,"There was a post here about how Spock (and Vulcans in general) can be seen as autistic, or at least based upon an autistic person, that I can’t seem to find now.
Anyway, there I discussed how there was another race that to me, always seemed to be an analogy of autism, and I thought I’d make a full post about it here.
 To start I should say that I am on the spectrum myself so that this discussion will be more from that perspective than that of, say a psychologist. 

Anyway, it seems to me that the Liberated Borg are the most autistic people in the universe. I realise that they are not a species, rather a group of races freed from a terrible hive-mind but that rather helps my case I believe.

So to start, unlike the Vulcans whose society is dedicated to the concept of hiding ones emotions, the Liberated Borg are from many different cultures that view things completely differently. Similar to how someone on the spectrum can be born anywhere and to any culture. They don’t fit in with what their culture asks of them. 

•They have emotions but don’t know how to deal with them. 
•They struggle with many of the concepts of socialisation and have to be taught how to interact with people. 
 •They seem like outsiders to everyone else because they don’t know how to fit in.
•They don’t always know the right way to go about getting something they want and can come across as rude without meaning to.
•They find it difficult to make friends, not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t know how to, as such they tend to come together in solidarity.
•They like to be punctual and efficient and dislike when things go wrong, (like being late)
•They can become obsessed by things that make them forget about other aspects of their lives.
•They like things done their way, without considering how others might feel. 
•They struggle with sensory overload, but it’s inverted. Instead of being too loud (just an example) its being too quiet.
•They can have incredible knowledge in one field they find interesting, while not knowing a thing about something seemingly obvious.
•Most importantly of all though. They are all unique and these features don’t define them. They struggle but they learn. What might seem like a disadvantage, can lead to advantages elsewhere. They all have their talents, and eventually form very close bonds built with understanding and loyalty. 

Obviously these traits are down to the story and their past traumas, but like most species in Trek, they represent an aspect of humanity. I believe it to be autism.",Autism in Star Trek

startrek,"Hello,

I’m just wondering if anyone can tell me about a model that was released. I’ve looked online and can’t find any information.

When I was a kid, I used to go to a sci-fi/comic shop, where they had a very large model of the Enterprise-D, this was when the show was still on the air, or maybe it had just finished a year or two prior.

I’d estimate it was 4ft, maybe 6ft but probably not. It certaintly took up an entire display window. What I mean is, it may have been moulded from the original filming models.

I saw the same model years later (around 2015) in a forbidden planet in Bristol, so it wasn’t custom made. However the staff had no idea about the history.

I’d just love to know more about it.",Large Enterprise Model?
startrek,"It seems to me that in every thread about Picard, comments originate from one of two camps: people who really appreciate the ride the show is taking us on, and people who have trouble enjoying the show because of its inconsistencies with both itself and with Star Trek past. And much like America's two political parties at the moment, debates between the two seem to be filled with resentment of one another. My solution to bridging this gap within this subreddit? Everyone should listen/watch BOTH the Greatest Discovery podcast and the re:Views posted on YouTube by RedLetterMedia.


If you're of the type wondering whether other fans must be watching with their brains turned off because of the show's seeming ignorance of canon or history (or sometimes logic), I think what you'd gain from listening to Adam and Ben is an understanding of how two people who have just as much fondness for Star Trek could enjoy Picard. I think you'd see that Adam and Ben are bright guys who are as big a Star Trek nerds as anyone else, they clearly do not watch with their brains turned off, and just engage with the show differently. Plus they're really funny.


If you're of the type wondering why other fans seem so nitpicky and frustrated with the show, I think what'd you gain from watching Mike and Rich is seeing how: 1) the issues they have with the show are very reasonable and often undeniable and 2) their criticism is borne out of a desire for high quality and a concern for how much care is given to a franchise they have deep affection for. They're far from sticks in the mud who sit around pining for old Trek and who hate anything new.


The two shows obviously aren't in dialogue and they won't reconcile the issues or viewpoints that the other one brings up, but I think digesting both of them helps produce a balanced view of the show and of modern Trek. Listening/watching them humanizes different perspectives and I think will lead to richer, more nuanced discussions among fans. I think you'll find them both worthwhile if you haven't already checked them out.",Greatest Discovery vs. Red Letter Media on ST: Picard
startrek,"I just finished Unification in my TNG watch through and at the end of Part 2 Data beems down to Romulus as his normal android self. He then talked to the common people supporting reunification, the senitor who is Spock's friend. In the same scene Several Romulan guards and Sela surround Data and Picard and Sela sais something along the lines of ""So this is the android I've grown to respect in combat"", addressing Data as an android in front of everybody. There is then few lines exchanged fairly calmly and they are taken prisoner. Durring that time only Spock and Picard are questioned and Data is unnecessary to the Romulans. 

Given what we now know about the Zhat Vash, and more importantly the general Romulan fear of synthetics, this seems rather strange. I get that a this point Data is one of 2 sentient androids and nobody knows how to make more, so he isn't an immanent threat. And might end up being useful as a Starfleet Officer so they don't kill him immediately. But it doesn't seem possible he could stand in front of Romulans from all walks of life as an android and nobody really seems to care. There isn't any unease or tension of any kind between the people in that scene. In the last episode of Picard Narak tells the Romulan myth of the original twins and he seems to expect the random Federation citizens he's talking to be at least a little familiar with it, which suggests every Romulan knows the story.

Obviously this is a ""The Zhat Vash and synth fear didn't exsist in the 80's so they writers didn't know"" situation. But does anybody have an in-universe explanation for why all the Romulans are chill with the destroyer of worlds secretly hanging out on Romulus?",Unification and the Zhat Vash

In fact, I read somewhere that in many aspects the Kelvin timeline was closer to 25th century technology in the main universe. We also saw how large and impressive a Constitution class ship was in this timeline. It is visibly larger than the Enterprise-D, possibly even E, and quite a bit more advanced than Kirk's main timeline ship.

The main thread should have been the Borg Reclamation Project. There could have been diplomatic controversies surrounding it, allowing some old school Picard diplomat content.

There could have still been the Zhat Vash, but they could have been targeting the Project for the same reasons they had about the synthetics.

With those two concepts being the thrust of the show, that would allow so much more time to cover the relationships of the characters.

I was excited when I saw that the Enterprise C's Ambassador Class had a much more Classic Trek design, but then bummed because I knew we were never going to see it again except in brief guest appearances. I was bummed again when I saw that the Enterprise B was an Excelsior Class ship (another design I feel unnecessarily elongated and flattened the classic design) and then lost interest in Starfleet ship design entirely when the Sovereign Class made its appearance. 

I don't understand the desire to keep flattening and elongating the classic design.

startrek,"I'm looking for an open discussion after watching Picard. I loved the series, don't get me wrong - but I was pretty disappointed for a season that revolved around Data and Hugh, there was no appearance of Geordi.

I've always been under the impression since TNG that Data and Geordi were best friends. Geordi always seemed to be the main go to guy for Data, encouraging him to explore dreams and emotions and Data even said to Lore that Geordi was his friend and that he would hurt Geordi for emotions when he was under Lore's influence. 

That's not to say that Picard didn't have a real profound influence on Data's development towards understanding humanity but they didn't seem to go and casually 'hang out' like Data and Geordi did on a normal friends basis - like Geordi and Data talk about their holodeck adventures.

startrek,"What shows or movies do you think feel like Star Trek but are not part of Star Trek at all? TBH I'm looking for good things to watch. 

I'll give the two that come to mind (feel free to take these as recommendations)

1. Interstellar: I know, I know, many people hate the ending, I love it but what ya gonna do. But conceptually this feels like Star Trek in a pre-Enterprise sort of way. You have an Earth that's dying from climate change as people are embracing anti-intellectualism and anti-science because they have simply lost hope in humanity's resilience. There's no immediate reason to hope so they just don't.   All changes when a group of human explorers goes into the unknown with a slim hope of saving humanity and expanding to the Stars. It's ultimately a story about how human ingenuity can accomplish anything. That's a very Star Trek message. 
2. Defiance: I recently rewatched this series, I was so pissed off when Syfy canceled it that I haven't given a Syfy show a chance ever since. This series is about a town where different alien species live in peace with each other, or they try at least. The backdrop of the series is a very vicious war between humanity and the aliens that left many cultural wounds between them. It ended when both sides in a battle defied orders, dropped their weapons,  work together to save the human and alien civilians that were caught in the crossfire.  It's very DS9 but set on Earth. The main character is the human sheriff, his alien adoptive daughter. (It also has beautiful cinematography for a Syfy TV show) 
3. BONUS: This is a completely different genre and medium, but if you haven't check out the Sherlock Holmes stories. 8/9 books are on the public domain so you can read them online, they're also short reads, like 100 pages each. There's a reason why there's such a crossover between Sherlock Holmes fans and Star Trek fans, they have similar themes and values but in completely different contexts.

Or should I watch the episodes in a certain order and alternate between the shows? Is there any crossover that I may miss if I don't watch them in a certain specific order.

Finally, what about the movies? Should I watch all the Original Series movies before even starting TNG or, again, watch them in between TNG episodes based on when they released?",Star Trek watching order?
startrek,"Most Americans and global citizens dont want socialism, and want capitalism to stay. But in a time like this, capitalism needs to recognize it needs to check itself and FREEZE itself for several months if it wants to bounce back faster from this. For instance, I owe money for rent, and if I dont pay, landlord MAYBE cant pay the mortgage he owns. As Fox news was thankfully pointing out last night, most of this all goes back to he banks. If we could all just freeze everything, and keep providing services for free, we could bounce back faster. If you had loans and mortgages and utilities, even cable/internet, all that should continue to be supplied at NO cost. We allow the utilities to be corporate owned, and they all fleece us on prices.

I just binged watched the season and wanted to write down some of my thoughts. I'm new to the Star Trek universe (except the JJ movies), and this was my first Star Trek show. 

And I will say I'm kinda in love with Star Trek now. The show was intriguing and exciting and was a fun ride. The whole universe was so cool (I really want a replicator please) and the overall story kept me on the edge of my seat. 

I really enjoyed all the characters, except for and I will probably get a lot of hate for this, Picard. He did have his moments for sure but I obviously have no prior knowledge or any nostalgic feelings for this guy, so I felt he was too much of a one dimensional, can only do good, character. He seems too black and white. Like he didn't have ANY misgivings about synth life that can literally destroy all organic life as we know it? Like he was a little too hyper optimistic. I know I definitely understood the viewpoint of the Tal Shiar given the vision/past they saw. 

But the moral greyness in a lot of the other characters, the sacrifice and motivations of some characters had to take especially in regards to taking a life to save another, is what really made this show great. Loved Narek (and his pain about loving Soji but needed to destroy her and her kind), Narissa (badass but anyone else get a little incest-y vibes from them early in the season tho?), Agnes (didn't care for her at first), 7 of 9 (also badass and gay. loved that she got revenge on that one chick on Free Cloud), Rios (love the multiple personality ship program thing, really cute) and pretty much the rest. 

However, I did think the ending was a little flat and unbelievable? I didn't have to suspend my disbelief THAT much prior to the finale. I know there was quite a bit of fan service in the show, and it kinda felt like the whole star fleet getting there in the nick of time by his old buddy was shoehorned in. Like this guy who hasn't been in Star Fleet for years just suddenly leads a giant fleet to stop an intergalactic event from happening? Not to mention they had banned synths and all of a sudden they're ok potentially starting a war with the Romulans just to save a handful of life they didn't deem worthy of existing in the first place? 

Plus the Romulans just backing out after they didn't activate the beacon was kinda too clean. The Tal Shiar's main objective their whole organization is dedicated to kill all synthetic life forms and they just back out? Would they not sacrifice themselves to see their main objective complete? And then synth ban is lifted and Picard comes back to life, which obviously they can't make a show with his name without him but it makes his sacrifice almost meaningless.

I think maybe if they hadn't rushed it so much and made the season a bit longer it might have felt more satisfying. However... saying all that, I do prefer a wrapped up season as opposed to cliff hangers. I'm glad the story was all concluded and I do love a happy feel good ending (that crew shot in the end tho!). Even tho the ending was pretty disappointing and a dip in the overall series I still loved the journey getting there and the season overall. And happy that this series exists, might make a trekkie outta me.

startrek,"In the opening of Hollow Pursuits, we see Dwight Schultz in ten forward acting like a loose canon in a starfleet uniform. Guinan says where he goes danger follows, and he pushes around Geordi and Riker. The illusion only really starts to break down when Troi is obviously into him after seeing him beat up her friends. 

Now to us, it might be more obvious that this is a guy living out a fantasy (either a dream or holodeck). 

But to audiences at the time, what was Dwight Schultz known for? He'd just finished his run on the A-Team as Howling Mad Murdock. So that makes him more credible as this tough guy that can bully the Enterprise crew. That makes it more believable that the writers might have actually cast him as this reckless violent officer. 

And then we have the reveal, Dwight Schultz is playing completely against type. Barclay is very different from his previous role, it really shows off his range.",Dwight Schultz in Hollow Pursuits was actually a nice bit of stunt casting.
startrek,"Seriously? This was supposed to be the cliff hanger for the end of S2 and the beginning of S3?

All I can think is that all of the decent writers were busy with finishing off DS9.

What an absolutely awful 2 parter. 

For example, how did the Kazon know how to operate a federation ship, acknowledged as being in advance of their own? Yes, they had Seska, but she'd have to teach everyone!

The monster of the fortnight was terrible, the pathetic erupting volcano, where did these incredible primitive people get their clothes from, there was no suggestion of any settlement?

startrek,"Nagilum revisited Picard among the stars in her classic comedy Hilarious:

His body is very disgusting. He is like a worm, and while his lips are black, they are not the worms. Like a silkworm, they come out of the hole and spend their time chewing. Although, I must point out that they are not flowers, just flowers, and they are rather hard to get rid of. When I write, I like to put in references to Shakespeare. I like to look at some of the classic plays, and try to relate them to my story.

startrek,"Thought/theory is for the Kelvin timeline and why the Enterprise seems huge compared to TOS and main timeline Constitution class ships. Could it be that since a future Romulan “mining” vessel attacked the Kelvin that Starfleet thought about it and were like “hmm. We need a bigger badder flagship than the one we have planned” and in so doing skipped the Constitution class and went straight into Constellation(?) or whichever is the next iteration or the one after that with size and power? 
Idk if it would be Galaxy class but probably by the time the Enterprise D comes to pass in the Kelvin timeline that would be further advanced as well. 
Pure speculation of course, and I think the real world explanation is it needed room for added shuttles and shuttle bays but I like thinking in world better. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of Picard. Now I’m pretty new to the universe of Trek, only finished TNG and in the second season of DS9, so I don’t have nearly the experience or knowledge to really say how it was as a Trek show and I get that. Having said that I’m kinda in the middle. 
On the one hand I loved Picard the character and his utter no nonsense on how Starfleet has disappointed him deeply. I’m on the fence about the world as it is since TNG explicitly stated, and I’m sure DS9 or Voyager also hinted at, that Earth is no longer about monetary gain or individual power and only wants to expand our knowledge and understanding of the universe or just do nothing. But they did I think a fair job in showing that maybe since the attack on Mars and Starfleet backing off that’s why things have gone back to our normal. 
On the other hand I also hate how characters we know and love aren’t around, for long at least, and the ones we do get are either boring or don’t get enough to do. Also starting to get annoyed with prophecies or warnings or in this case both at the same time. 
I do wish that for Picard they had made it more of the exploration of space with a subplot of the Romulan ploy or something like that and especially with the slow opening of the first few episodes that would have been better. 

Now for the season finale and Godamn idk how to feel about it. Gonna be honest I kinda wanted the Romulans and Starfleet to get into a massive battle as that could have been awesome but that’s not Star Trek and I get it. What Picard did was 100% the only way to go about it. 
His mind being transferred was absolutely predicted and foreshadowed and even though I knew they were going there I was hoping they wouldn’t and I would get pissed if they did it. So hoping they would just let him die after saving an entire race of androids and preventing a massive war. I know the show is called Picard but still they could have continued the show in his memory if they wanted. 
I still lost it when he died though. I don’t care if we all knew he was going to live so it shouldn’t matter or whatever but we still literally watched him die. The Picard we knew is dead. This Picard, while maintaining his DNA and memories, isn’t the Picard that died. He even had to make sure they didn’t make him immortal so that alone still confirms it isn’t our Picard. Having said that he’s also gonna be the Picard we still look up to and believe in. 
I’m intrigued to see where season 2 goes, hopefully the return of other beloved characters and some real space exploration stuff, and I’ll see if I care to resubscribe at that point",A random thought/potential theory and feelings on Picard *SPOILERS* sorta
startrek,"Out of all of the ST shows, Voyager is perhaps the one with the most potential, that was the least developed.

It goes beyond just photontorpedoes and shuttlecraft. After each episode, everything is back to normal and the crew goes back to being just regular Starfleet folks doing their thing.

There’s no sense of these people actually believing or acting like they’re going to be stuck in the Delta Quadrant for decades.


So how would you change the show and makes it live up to its premise?

Here are some of my ideas:

* Janeway starts turning the Voyager into a generational ship. They start growing their own food, plants start lining the corridors to take some of the pressure of the oxygen system.

* As the season begins, we see Starfleet members wearing their usual uniforms, while the Maquis crewmembers wear their clothes, just with combadges. As the season progresses, we see the two styles mix more. Starfleet uniforms appearing more out of regulation and Maquis members wearing parts of Starfleet uniforms.

* Janeway and the senior officers also come to the realization that in worst case scenario they need to start having children. Naturally encouraging people will only go so far, so what to do? Should the computer just pair people up? Artificial insemination? What about people who for some reason don’t want children?

* They decide to introduce holodeck and replicator ration priority to people who sign up for having children, which naturally leads to some grumbling. Will this ultimately lead to Voyager becoming a ship with a privileged class and an underclass? What about polygamous marriages? They’re against Starfleet regulations, but some crewmembers want to try that arrangement. Janeway decides to allow it and go against Starfleet regulations. One of many violations of official regulations to come.

* Janeway uses some Starfleet emergency regulation to declare existing marriages null and void. Janeway and the senior officers decide that they must lead by example, so she expects each of her senior officers to pair up with another. Much to her anguish she also chooses to set a good example, but with who? She knows Tuvac better, but marrying Chakotay might lessen the Maquis-Starfleet tensions that have been brewing.

* The Voyager gets an opportunity to take some years off their journey, but it means they must violate Starfleet directives. Janeway does this, and starts to realize that she might have to break more in the future to ensure the ships safety. Ultimately she decides not to commit an even more egregious violation of their principles. Which leads to...

* Janeways trial. The crew put Janeway on trial. For breaking Starfleet protocol? Or is it because she didn’t do enough to bring them home? The Voyager is in full mutiny, the senior officers are divided. Should they use force? Ultimately Janeway notices something encouraging. The fracture lines aren’t between Maquis and Starfleet crewmembers. Instead some of the Maquis join Starfleet crewmen in wanting to restore order, while some Starfleet crewmen have joined in with former Maquis and demand that they no longer strictly adhere to Starfleet protocol. As a result...

* The Voyager holds elections for the post of Captain and First officer. Janeway, much to her chagrin realizes that the ship that some day will return to the Alpha quadrant may not be a Starfleet vessel but something very different.

Aaaand, that would be my short treatment for the first season or two of Voyager.

What do you think? How would you make the show live up to its full potential?",How would you make Voyager more interesting?
startrek,"Let's be honest. We say TOS, but the title of the show is not ""Star Trek: the original series"", it is just ""Star Trek"" . Every series afterwards has been ""Star Trek: (insert series name)""  but the first show is still just ""Star Trek"".  So here is how we should properly refer to every show. 

Instead of TOS, we should say Star Trek, or ""ST"" 

TAS, or ST:TAS is still appropriate for the animated series. 

TNG or ST:TNG is still appropriate for the next generation.

DS9, or ST:DS9 is still appropriate for deep space nine

However, I’ve never watched them in chronological order just whichever I felt like starting. So is it worth it? Does it feel like a more cohesive story?

startrek,"The Star Trek franchise has always had some references to martial arts since the original, but most fighting was still old-fashioned stage combat or Western cowboy stuff. I think Discovery and Picard have way too much martial arts and it seems silly. I understand it's the trend in Hollywood since The Matrix and other movies started showcasing Hong Kong-style elaborate fight choreography. I'm a martial arts fan but I think there's too much of that genre crossing into the sci-fi of Trek, which is supposedly based on the possibilities of real science and astrophysics. Elaborate kung fu fighting is a fantasy. Burnham and Georgiou have been at it since the beginning of Discovery, and now in Picard we see Jason Bourne androids, a Romulan anime samurai, and Romulan spies doing spinning jump kicks. Does anyone else wish for the good ol' two-handed karate chop against a slow-moving Gorn? Or just a single punch and someone quips, ""Cowboy diplomacy?""

Maybe just have their bed scan them every night while they sleep, so it's more frequent. Then keep the backup on hand so if they die, the most recent scan can be fed into the transporter.

I find it kind of amusing and sad that she requested to leave Star Trek. Why would she ever do that? She was punching above her weight. I think that was probably just a PR story and she probably got booted.",Tasha Yar or Denise Crosby I should say
startrek,"I occasionally dozed off while watching Picard, so I was a bit fuzzy on the backgrounds of the androids in Picard. After searching Google, I learned that Sutra was made by Soong and Maddox, and she used to have a twin (Jana), who was killed by Captain Vandermeer before he killed himself, which traumatized Rios and turned him into an alcoholic.

What I haven’t been able to figure out is why Dahj and Soji had dormant combat programming in their systems. When I was watching Picard, I felt like maybe Commodore Oh was using Dahj’s mom as a mask to manipulate her, but that doesn’t make sense, since Dahj killed a bunch of Romulans.

I used to catch TOS reruns on TV when I was a kid, but the military-style 60s kitsch and long dramatic pauses are not my thing. But there has to be something good here, right? I mean, Spock? Action? Casual sexism? 

I'm 11 episodes into Season 1. The first few episodes feel both too slow and underdeveloped, plot-wise - long on long stares and short on background. Spock is a lot less severe and Holmesian than I remembered. I thought we'd be seeing more of Sulu and Scotty by now. When do we get to the tribbles? And where the hell is Chekov?

Were they trying to make him skip that rank? Maybe, at TNG time, commodores were called ""rear admiral"" and they spoke just ""admiral"" to shorten. 

Anyway, as someone who only watched the series and movies and didn't read any of the novels, I have my doubts if Jean Luc, Kirk and Janeway were ever commodores/rear admirals or they just skipped straight to full admiral because they're so awesome.",Was Picard ever a commodore?
startrek," Oh, shit. I just figured out how Picard should have actually   
 ended. 

(spoilers)

 I'd keep almost everything the same - the crew on the planet convince  the androids to close the portal (stupid though the mystery box was)  Riker shows up and convinces the Romulans to leave (lame though the deus  ex machina was), and then Picard's aneurism triggers and he collapses  to the floor. 

The crew beam down to the planet and begin trying  to upload Picard's consciousness to the android-body. Picard's ""soul""  goes to the databank and speaks to Data's ghost and they say their  tearful farewells, Picard agrees to pull the plug and let Data die. 

 Meanwhile, in the real world, disaster - Dr Soong has selfishly  sabotaged the process, transmitting his own consciousness to the  android. ""Picard died a natural death,"" he argues, ""There's no reason he  should get what was meant to be mine!""

7 of 9 shows up and saves  the day; she injects Picard with Borg nanites that can regulate his  neural activity and keep him alive; the crew re-download his  consciousness back to his original body, and everybody is happy (though  obviously Dr Soong is now a pariah). Picard makes it clear he's happier  in his own skin, even if he has a small bit of borg tech back in the  mix, so everyone's relieved. 

They hold a small memorial for Data and pull the plug, just like in the original show. 

 The crew beams up to the ship and warps away, feeling like big damn  heroes. The credits roll. Then we get an after-credits scene...

 Picard wanders the halls of the ship. There's something... different,  something cold about his posture, about his face. He finds 7 of 9,  alone. She smiles. Her eyes flash green-and-back. When she speaks, it is  with the thousand voices of a Collective...

OMG! This show is soo fucking stupid. Such a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay for it. 

Let me start off by saying that I appreciate a lot with you Millenials. You are great with I.T., you have a wonderful sense of confidence, but your storytelling... is... just stupid. And that is what Picard seems to me to be, a Millenial version of Star Trek. You got the cliche badasses with vape pens, tattoos, the computer voice that sounds just like Siri, the impossibly badass fight scenes, the Lord of the Rings reject character, the convoluted storyline (because if it's complicated it makes it good right), the Game Of Thrones gore, that ""quirky"" sense of humor, the drinking whiskey out of the bottle, The F-bombs, and on and on.

Looking at Netflix or really any other streaming services, very few of the new shows are Sci-Fi.  And the ones that are (Lost in Space season 2) are kind of lackluster and predictable.

startrek,"I've seen bits and pieces of Star Trek over the years, but I'd never been a huge Trekkie or anything like that. However, I eventually realized that a good deal of the sci-fi I've read/watched over the years is..kind of bleak and depressing. I love Blade Runner as much as the next person, but you can only read/watch so many cyberpunk/post apocalyptic stories about humanity failing to make any sort of progress in the future without getting kinda depressed. I realized I was craving some optimistic, humanistic sci fi where the future isn't a total shithole, so last December I decided to start watching Star Trek from the beginning. 

On the whole, I liked TOS a lot, especially the first two seasons. Despite the dated special effects and the surprising amount of casual sexism, a lot of it held up really well! My top ten episodes: 

1. **Balance of Terror** - A genuinely thrilling story. The fear and uncertainty surrounding the Romulans' sudden attacks on the Federation's outposts, the mutual respect between Kirk and the Romulan commander, it was all so well done. 

2. **The Enterprise Incident** - One of the few truly great episodes in season 3. I love the Cold War-style conflict between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire, and the budding forbidden romance between Spock and the Romulan commander makes me think of this episode as basically a Spock-centered Balance of Terror. 

3. **Journey to Babel** - The episode that really made me love Spock as a character. 

4. **The Doomsday Machine** - Like Balance of Terror, an episode that's aged very well. 

5. **The Immunity Syndrome** -The Enterprise vs. a giant space amoeba, some self-sacrifice from Spock, and Kirk refusing to allow it. What's not to love? 

6. **The Changeling** - Classic ""talking a computer to death"" stuff. 

7. **Obsession** - An underrated episode with some great character moments for Kirk and Bones. 

8. **The Trouble With Tribbles** - The scene where Kirk is chewing out his crewmen for getting into a bar fight with the Klingons never fails to crack me up. 

9. **The Devil in the Dark** - Another underrated episode. 

10 **The Ultimate Computer** - Fascinating episode about the dangers of AI. 

If you're wondering why I don't have **The City on the Edge of Forever** or **Mirror, Mirror** on my top ten list like everyone else does, it's because I think that those two, while good, are both a little overrated and don't deserve to be counted among the absolute best episodes. 

Now that the positive stuff has been said, I'll give some criticisms. Season 3 was a struggle to get through. The only episodes from this season that I really loved and can see myself rewatching we're The Enterprise Incident, The Tholian Web, and Day of the Dove. The rest of it ranges from mediocre to straight-up-awful (Spock's Brain, Turnabout Intruder). 

I'm also surprised at how underdeveloped Sulu and Uhura are as characters. After three seasons, I couldn't tell you a thing about their personalities, despite them being regulars. That said, I love Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty, and the post-episode banter between the three main characters was some of my favorite parts of the show.

startrek,"Greetings everyone on this fine quarentined day. Over the past couple weeks I have recently found myself exposed to the new trek as well as the criticisms behind them and wanted to share my experiences as well as hear from others on theirs.

To point out though, I am only 18 years old. I have been watching Star Trek since I was two and have watched every series and movie. I do not know everything about Star Trek but I do know I am a major fan. I had initially avoided the New Treks, such as Discovery and the movies, since many negative opinions were floated around online. However, I have finally watched them and come to love them.

To start off, the movies. I had no quarrel with them at all. It was an attempt at starting over. Letting a new universe be built. I loved the fact that a seperate timeline was created just for that. I found it ingenious. However, I have never been the biggest fan of TOS. This new take on the movies gave me a new interest in Captain Kirk as a character and his growth in this new timeline. However, I was more intrigued by the relationship between him and Spock. The strongest bond between a captain and first officer ever seen in Star Trek. (I know many will say Picard and Riker were strong as well, but I saw that more as a Mentor/Ward relationship than a relationship between equals). Overall, I enjoyed the idea of the movies more than the movies themselves. I honestly was wondering if we would ever get a Kelvin Picard.

Next, Picard. Now, when I heard Picard was coming out, I started giggling like a child. My favorite species has always been the Borg. They were the species that caught the most of my attention throughout all of Star Trek. So, when I heard Picard was being made, I knew the Borg would return. In the past, over psychoanalysis of trauma indured by Star Trek characters seemed a bit... brushed by? I think this was because the world of Star Trek was originally assumed to be a sort of Utopia besides the happenings in space. I have heard several comments about how Gene Roddenberry would have never let certain things happen like they have been with New Trek. For instance, The Seven/Picard heart to heart of their trauma as Borg. Anyways, I digress. I watched Picard as each episode came out. I was seeing a lot of hate for it though. Some was understandable I would admit, but I noticed, the less I tried to compare it to continuity, the more I would enjoy it. Picard was the perfect love letter to the character of Data. I loved every second of it. The ending was slightly predictable though, however, thats how it is when you want to make more than one season. Picards characterization seemed a bit scattered at first but seemed to piece itself together near the end. I loved seeing the aftermath of the Romulan Supernova and seeing what the federation has become. Its flaws being unveiled. A common theme in New Trek. I always have enjoyed politics in movies and understanding motives. I guess that is why I liked the Star Wars Prequel triology. I will admit though, it does not take the cake as my favorite Star Trek series.

Finally, Discovery. Oh boy. The awful comments I have heard of this show over the years. I never stepped near it until recently and I must admit, I was surprised and impressed. After watching Picard, I knew Discovery's biggest problem will be keeping to continuity. I knew if I watched it while keeping that in mind, I would find myself miserable. So, I watched it without it in mind and frankly, I loved it. The character depth in the 15 episode first episode made me feel so connected to the characters faster than even my favorite Star Trek: DS9. I loved the politics behind it all. The lore expansion of Sarek and consequently Spock. I loved the fact that the Mirror Universe became a maine plot point. I loved how despite Starfleets imperfections, its morals and values was the main driving force. The action sequences were incredible. The idea of the spore drive, although a bit out of the wrong time frame, is freaking cool. At the time of this post, I am on Season 2 Episode 2. I must say, I have fell in love with Captain Pike so quickly. The wisdom he holds is prominent. The actor who portrays him is excellent. I am so excited for the second season plus whenever the third comes out

startrek,"I just watched the Voyage Home because the Guardian did an article on it. 

I mean, the writing is a masterclass, no line is wasted, whether it’s an (earned) character moment, a set up to a later scene (or a payoff) or just a nice general piece of witty business.  

The performances, particularly the leads, are note perfect, underplayed, and warmly conveyed with just the right amount of tongue in cheek. Most of it actually plays more seriously than I actually remembered. There’s only one bit of *The Shat*, when he spots George and Gracie on the side of the bus. 

Other than that, it’s a perfect piece of storytelling, with the emphasis on story. 

All too often we see things that are either all plot and no character or all character and no plot. This was a fine example of ST doing both.  It deserves its place as the best performing (as I understand it, when adjusted) and is probably the best recognised (after Khan) with the general public, even if that’s just as “the one with the whales”.

'juvenile' is the best way to put it. this comes through most in the dialogue. clumsily written and inarticulate, like a child trying to express a very deep thought but lacking the language to express it. you read between the lines and say 'i'll give you a pass because i understand what you were *trying* to say.'

i have complicated feelings toward most of the social allegories in star trek. people who criticize these usually say something along the lines of 'old trek had subtlety, new trek beats you over the head with a moral stance'. ok, fine point to make, we could debate the trueness of that statement all day. personally i think old trek was just as hamfisted; we put up with it because everything else was campy in equal measure. but i think it misses the actual issue, that being that almost every allegory it attempts lacks depth. hate in real life is this complicated web of emotion and bias and circumstance. when trek does a direct allegory it usually goes something like 'x aliens don't like y aliens, because they're y'. childish. you know?

i think this is why my least favourite episodes are ones dealing with large-scale interplanetary conflicts. war is a tricky subject. star trek... tends to swing in the direction of unintentional propaganda. 

to clarify, this isn't about realism. it's a melodrama. i don't seek literal realism in a genre that sets out to be a dim echo of reality at best. i do want it to *feel* real. good fiction will convince you of the most unbelievable things. this particular aspect leaves me unconvinced.",does anyone feel the entire franchise is consistently written in a really juvenile way?
startrek,"I would have rewritten the series so that the synthetics end up summoning the Q.

Imagine how fucking amazing it would have been a this build up, the portal gets activated and Q just show's up, turns to the Android's and says


 ""Ok where would you like to go live?""

Everyone is standing there stunned, Q turns to then an says

""Oh please you organics and your prophecies, I always told the Continuum that the warning was far too apocalyptic""

Picard calls down from his ship 

""What is going on down there?""

Q responds

""Jean Luc  you didn't really believe that we would destroy all organic life how banal and uncreative, we simply wanted to ensure synthetics had a chance to properly flourish and live up to their potential""

The Romulan fleet move to attack

Q waves his hand and their ships disappear

""Well enough of that"" he turns to the Android's ""and you my distant distant cousins where can I take you on what planet would you like to make your home, if you're comfortable here I can simply rearrange some things""



Kinda a shit post and yes the entire show would need to be rewritten around this ending but God damn the entire time I'm watching and going where the hell is the Q? aren't they supposed to be pretty much involved in any galaxy-wide Extinction? Does anyone really believe the Q would sit around and let humanity be wiped out by some other seemingly omnipotent being? To Q it would be like watching someone kill your puppy and doing nothing

Just my 2 cents",The biggest missed opportunity in Picard
startrek,"Now I've been alive almost as long as trek has been on the air,  so yes I'm an old trekkie,  but I do have a question, While I like the visual styling,  I wonder we do have evidence from ds9/voyager that the uniforms are one way, but then they are another way in picard,   the 3d interface, we know it's a thing,  which is cool.  

But why has everything ship wise taken on a huge discovery feel and look?  the ships themselves also look like they went backwards to 23rd century designs.    was this because of the wars? and the lack of the ability for the federation to rebuild quickly?  I'm so confused on this, I remember tos era, tos movie era and then bam tng era and I had the same questions back then basically.",Visual changes why?
startrek,"So I recently watched Chain of Command and I won't gush too much but suffice to say the episode earns its status and reputation. Strangely despite initially disliking Gul Madred I actually ended up liking him in some sense. I know that sounds weird, but I wasn't expecting him to get the character development that he did, which coupled with the fine acting of David Warner gave a full picture of his character that I appreciated rather than some one dimensional monster. I also like how he actually seems to have a good deal of respect for Picard despite being his torturer and I think some of the best moments in the episode are when he accidentally let's his guard down around Picard. There's almost a strange Stockholm Syndrome dynamic in a way.


However my question lies at the end of the episode in the infamous 'four lights' scene. After being told he is too be released just after one last torturous move by Madred Picard defiantly shouts that there are four lights, despite believing there are three. As Picard is dragged away we see his torturer give a little smile. Initially I assumed he was smiling out of an admiration for Picard, knowing that the respect he had come to have for him was earned, but when the episode ended I reflected on the smile again wondering if Madred knew that he had cracked Picard and was pleased with himself, if he understood that in the end his captive truly believed there were five lights. I'm wondering if anyone else has given this much thought and if so what conclusions you've come to, would love to hear some discussion about this and anything else about the two part episode really. I'm not sure what the general consensus is but I feel like they also gave a good deal of character development to Captain Jellico and I'm glad he wasn't just a straight up asshole if you'll excuse the term. Despite not liking him overall (not disliking either) I actually felt like Riker was being unreasonable at times and maybe a little arrogant, while also seeing both men's side. Very good episode.",I have a character question about Gul Madred in TNG's 'Chain of Command'. Looking for some discussion.
startrek,"Ok, so I know this is probably a foolish question to ask on a subreddit called ""Star Trek"" but I'm doing it anyway. Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek in order? The reason I'm asking this is because I know many of the big moments that happen in the franchise. I know about Spock's death, Kirk's death, ""Kahn!!!!!!!"", Picard's transformation into a Borg, the Voyager making it back to Earth, Data's death, and some other small things. I really want to watch the show because I have a desire to explore and see the unknown, but I'm afraid the series has been ruined for me since I know most of the major plot points. What do you guys think? Should I do it?",Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek from beginning to end?
startrek,"So there’s been a lot of debate about the different captains: Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Sisko.

But what about the second in command, their “Number Ones”?


I’ve taken the liberty of ranking them from worse to worst, and starting off the list we have... 

Riker: Picard’s faithful right hand, who was a little too happy with his lot. Instead of moving up in the ranks, like you’re supposed to, Riker was seemingly obsessed with his captain and stayed on year after year. He passed on multiple opportunities to become captain, despite the problems this created. (Namely: Holding back other officers who wanted to be promoted to Riker’s position.)


Kira: Who somehow managed to become Sisko’s second in command despite having a background as a... Terrorist. Kira constantly second guessed Sisko, and never missed a chance to become involved in some conflict of interest when it came to Bajor. Rather than being a neutral party, Kira would either make enemies of Bajorian political and religious leaders, or become involved with them romantically.


And the worst of the worst?


Chakotay: Who not only joins Kira in having “terrorist” on the resume, but also was so immersed in his ancestral, new age mumbo jumbo, that his spirit animal probably would have made a more competent Commander. 

We’re talking about a man so utterly irresponsible, that he (on at least one occasion) risked the ship and entire crew **because of a peyote fueled vision quest!**",Who was the worst number 1?
startrek,"the Set up of voyager was so unique and had such promise. 2 crews, 1 from a new starship with mostly Junior officers left,  the other a rag tag team of terrorists/ freedom fighters who hate the federation almost as much as the Cardassians. Both crews commanded by captains who couldn't be more different.  Janeyway was a veteran of star fleet but she didn't have a lot of real world command experience. Chakotay rejected an already brilliant career starfleet and embraced being a cold and calculating rebel leader. But with Voyager so far from any allies or supplies they had not choice but to work together to find a way home.  The 2 crews would have amazing conflicts and problems we'e never seen in star trek before. 

Well pretty much all of that was dropped during the first season.  The 2 crew conflicts were entirely dropped and rarely even mentioned again, Voyager's isolation and inability to properly resupplyor repair became more like a continuity error running gag.  Janeway was rewritten to be completely schizophrenic and Chakotay, who was set up and acted so well at the beginning of the show  just turned into stat trek's biggest nothing burger. Voyager isn't star trek's worst series, but it's complete waste of it's immense potential will always be it's only achievement for me.",The wasted potential of Voyager always pissed me off
startrek,"Not sure if this could ""technically"" be considered a spoiler, but better safe-than-sorry I guess.

I'm watching BBCAmerica, and they're airing the famed Bruce Maddox episode about Data's sentience. (""*The Measure of a Man*"") This is the first time I've watched the episode since I started watching Picard.

Now having watched the entire first season of Picard, I find myself watching this episode with new eyes. 

The episode seems to have more weight... seems to be more *special*. 

What do you think? Have you gone back and watched this episode yet? What are your thoughts now, as opposed to pre-Picard?",Does Picard change your view of TNG?
startrek,"1) Where did Maddox get the image for Dahj and Soji

It's established in the first episode that those twins were modled after Data's painting ""Daughter"". This is latter confirmed when they crewe find Maddox at Freecould. However it's also confirmed nobody except Picard had access to that painting. Given his reaction isn't ""Well someone probably space-googled it"", it feels safe to say that was a private painting. Maybe Maddox asked the Data simulation, but then why didn't Data ask someone to be terminated before? When Picard asks if he's immortal Alton states ""we were all listening"". This seems to be a reference to what Data said but it could easily be what Picard said when telling everybody what happened when he talked to Data again after being put into the Golem. We don't see any monitors or ways to look into the Data simulation so the latter seems more likely.

2) Where did Maddox get a neuron from Data's brain?

In the first episode Jurati doesn't believe Maddox could have created any androids becouse he would have needed ""a single neuron from Data's positronic net"" to completely re-create it. While it can be argued this is more symbolic, in the opening credits we see a single ""atom-thing"" split into to and start forming artificial DNA and an eye, which suggests the new android parts are ""grown"" (in pairs) from the one neuron. But it's never explained HOW he got that neuron when Data's body was completely destroyed. Did he venture to the several year old site of the battle from Nemesis and painstakingly look for a single neuron? Did he use B4, and if so why arn't the new androids less developed as that would be re-growing B4's positronic net, not Data's.

3) Why is Data a formless consciousnesses (in universe, it makes sense thematically and for the plot)

I'm perfectly fine accepting Maddox re-built Data's positronic net, then studied and improved upon it to make the superior new androids (contractions, complex emotions, etc). However, when we meet Data again, he's consciousness was restored and put into a ""highly complex quantum simulation"" without any real form. My question is why? If the process of re-creating Data's positronic net (seemingly a physical thing) is actually just restoring code then how did Maddox get any useful information to create the new androids? Not to mention where did he put Data's consciousness if he didn't have a positronic brain for it, as he had yet to study Data. If Maddox did completely restore Data's brain but not his body, why didn't he just build Data a new body when he was able to? Or for that matter build him a ""fully human"" one like Dahj and Soji? Or why not steel B4 when he left and just replace the brains? Or steel Lore for that matter (who was stored somewhere at Starfleet after TNG). They mentioned Data's memories caused B4's net to fail so it wouldn't me murder of any kind.

4) Brain and brain, what is brain?

On a final note Data's new brain doesn't appear to be his old one at all. When Picard pulls the plug, he literally pulls out 3 isolinear-like chips, each one ""ages"" his consciousness. However if the whole point of restoring Data was to study his brain, why is he now stored on 3 chips? You could argue these chips store the simulation while Data is hooked up inside the machine, but then what Picard did isn't death, it's just pulling his off switch which can be turned on at any point. If Data was moved from his brain so Maddox could story it by destroying it then what was he moved to if nobody could build a positronic net that sophisticated?

startrek,"I realize it's not officially a separate timeline, but it kind of feels like it. 

In Discovery you have Section 31 operating basically openly, doing shady shit to make the Federation more powerful,  and also the Admirals pardoning a xenocidal tyrannt to get her help in destroying an entire planet to win a war.

startrek,"Recently, the moderation staff was talking over the uncharted possibilities of April Fools gags we could feature on the subreddit today. Most of us agreed that, given the global situation, it may not be the right time for tomfoolery. In lieu of a prank or biting satire, we're instead interested in sharing with the community one of the things that Star Trek does best: hope. 

We discussed it and came up with a few episodes that always leave us feeling optimistic and uplifted, and we would love to hear from the community about what in Star Trek can always bring the light, even in dark times. 

##Star Trek: Discovery
* S02E02 ""New Eden"": Pike, Burnham, and Owosekun beam down to a planet of WWIII-era humans who have created an aggregate religion and have left behind science, and only Discovery can save them from an impending natural disaster. In the end, there is an everlasting ember of hope left with the people of the planet, even if they don't all know its true nature. 

##Star Trek: Enterprise
* S02E02 ""Carbon Creek"": In this episode, T'Pol tells an ostensibly apocryphal story about the real first landing of Vulcans on Earth, of her 'great-grandmother' experiencing humans in rural America in the 1950s. The episode is lighter in tone than many of the series, and explores acceptance, learning about new cultures, and discovering things to be cherished in the most unexpected places. 
* S02E24 ""First Flight"": Basically, this episode is what was originally conceived to be the first season, a Star Trek adaptation of  the early NASA missions a la *The Right Stuff*. It's pure Star Trek: optimistic and hard working people who solve a seemingly insurmountable obstacle because they're fueled by the motivation of exploration. 

##Star Trek: the Original Series
* S01E19 ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"": After the Enterprise is thrown back to the 1960s, the crew has to rescue a fighter pilot without damaging the timeline at such an important moment in human history. Somewhat like ""First Flight"", this episode is centered around the 1960s optimism-fuel that was the space race, and predicted eventual missions to Saturn. 
* S02E15 ""The Trouble with Tribbles"": Adorable, funny, sweet, with a kitschy whodunit, it's impossible to finish this episode without a big smile on your face. Particularly for those sheltering with beloved pets, this is a must-watch. 

##Star Trek: the Next Generation
* S05E25 ""The Inner Light"": largely considered one of the best episodes of any series, ""The Inner Light"" is a meditation on life, even the most humble life, and all of its complexity and pain and beauty. The episode is unmissable. 
* S06E15 ""Tapestry"": a personal favorite, Jean-Luc Picard is critically injured on an away mission, and Q shows up to play the role of Clarence in allowing Picard to see what his life would have been like had he made a decision differently. This is a perfect episode to help one process regret and the very ending is one of the most beautiful character moments for Picard. 

##Star Trek: Deep Space Nine 
* S03E22 ""Explorers"": a classic episode of exploration, honoring the explorers of the past, and overcoming adversity, with some beautiful father-son character moments along the way. And having Gul Dukan eat crow at the end is the icing on the cake. 
* S06E14 ""One Little Ship"": hey, remember that time the Rubicon was smaller than a hotwheel and they beat a bunch of Jem'Hadar? It's impossible not to have a great time with this episode. 

##Star Trek: Voyager
* S04E36 ""Hope and Fear"": This episode is about hope, then not hope, then hope again. In this hope sandwich, Voyager is made aware of the USS Dauntless, a Federation ship with an experimental propulsion system that could mean getting home. While all is not what it seems, both seeing the crew given hope by this possibility and the wonderful discovery in the end something wonderful does happen. 
* S06E09 ""Blink of an Eye"": This one's got it all: timefoolery, space-race-era alien astronaut, ancient astronauts, Daniel Dae Kim, and most of all seeing a planet go from pre-Industrial to post-Voyager, and seeing them take responsibility for saving themselves and saving Voyager. And that last shot.

I'm really enjoying it. After barely making it through two series of Discovery and giving up entirely on Picard half way through for being an incoherent mess, this is a real treat.

What the ever loving fuck?

This episode features a friendly and advanced alien race that clearly keeps its third gender as chattel slaves. Yet the episode seems to harp on cultural acceptance, and after the Cogenitor’s request for asylum is denied and she kills herslef, it’s framed as some kind of important lesson for Tuck? The only person in this persons life of ever treated her like a person?

What the hell am I missing here? Captain Archer ranting about how it’s not our right to judge their culture, feeling like an entirely different character than the one who broke imprisoned Suliban from that concentration camp. Tuck seems to accept that he is mainly at fault, as opposed to his Captain who forced a slave to return to their master?

What in the hell is up with this?",Giving Enterprise a first watch through and I had a quick rant about this episode.
startrek,"Wow, guys. Just wow.

I'm 36, open minded, and want to like this.

Before 2 days ago, I had never seen a full ST episode or movie. I knew about Klingons and Spock's ""live long and prosper"" haha signal. I also knew Professor X was the captain. Aaand that's pretty much it.

Corona yadda yadda, time on my hands. Let's dive in proper. I googled where to start. Everyone says the old school show. Ok. I was shocked to learn ""The Original Series"" was only on the air for 3 years.

5 episodes in, I'm starting to get a feel for the gist of the concept, but I'm absolutely dying. I've already seen the same set used twice. This hurts. I'm spoiled. I know. I keep going. By episode 7, I need something else. I skip ahead to season 3. To episodes in, I can't take anymore. I jump to the first move from the late 70's.

Ok. Now this is where I start to get pissed.

I am sure, back in the day, this was a magnitudinous event. Ten years of no Star Trek, and now a high budget movie. I get it. People were stoked. This, of course, was before my time. I wouldn't know. But I can guess.

Kirk meets Scotty. Oh the joy. Kirk sees The Enterprise... And FOR TEN MINUTES boards it. The epic music. Dragging. Dragging. Oh my God, it's dragging. Then Kirk meets ""Bones"" McCoy. I still don't know why he calls him that. Holy shit, another epic meetup. Then The Enterprise takes off into space in another dull sequence. Oh my God, it's so slow. Then Spock shows up. Great, he's awesome. But he sucks in this movie. WTF - I'm an HOUR into this shit and NOTHING has happened.

Seriously, guys, I'm pissed. I've invested like 9 or 10 hours of my life into this and all I want is Chewbacca.

startrek,"SPOILERS FOR PICARD/DISCOVERY(maybe)

**Don’t just downvote as nutrek hate, I don’t hate any of it,** I’m just looking for people’s perspective. 

I mean the whole plot of Picard doesn’t really count as world building in my mind. It’s just story telling. They aren’t writing any new LORE (not data’s brother, I mean worldbuilding) 

For instance, today I saw an episode of voyager, the one where belanna visits the barge of the dead. A whole hour dedicated to exposition on Klingon death beliefs and there was another voyager episode where fake kaless shows up, another whole hour dedicated to exposition on the deep inner workings of Klingon society. Not to mention worfs multiple sagas and that’s like I dunno at least 10 more hours revealing the inner workings of Klingon politics, expectations, roles in their society, etc. not to mention ds9 and what we learn about cardassians. Remember that whole episode dedicated to a cardassian lawyer and his daily life in court and we learn about cardassian justice system. We learn so much about these societies and it’s fascinating. 

Then discovery comes along, what do we learn? Klingons bad, unite for battle. That’s.... shallow. A traitor captain in the mix didn’t add anything of interest either... again just story telling. No world building. 

Same in Picard, all we really learn about the romulans is there happens to be a bunch who hate androids and try to kill em. Ok but.... what else? So simplistic and shallow. Nothing built... just a story in the framework of existing lore. 

The universe (of lore) is no longer being built and this deeply disappoints me. 

Anyone else feel similarly?","I feel like 90s/classic trek constantly did “world building”, but modern Trek “only tells stories” in what was previously established. They stopped fleshing out the universe. This is why I feel disappointed in new Trek."
startrek,"Seriously I have enjoyed Enterprise from season 2 onwards, I don't see how it could be so hated while so much stuff is agreed to be worse. While I hated Discovery I disliked a lot of TNG, DS9 and VOY episodes that seem equally terrible so I find it hard to see why a series that seems like a really good entry point to a new viewer or a place for old viewers to find so much hate would be able to take up so much conversation. Some of these episodes are well good and I feel like a lot of them deserve proper consideration

This is not an edit, but for the purpose of your criticism the only series I really genuinely dislike is Discovery. I do dislike individual episodes of the others quite a bit though. Criticise and advise as you see fit","Why is Enterprise so good, and why is it so often left as the worst trek in people's opinions"
startrek,"I have never seen Star Trek before, that was, until tonight when I came across 'Deep Space Nine' on NetFlix.  Just finished episode five where Tosk, whom of which I guess is considered to be an 'alien' that crashed into their region of the galaxy, needed their help woth repairing his ship.

I like the storyline and occasional humor.  The brown dude with huge ears plays a very cool character as well.

Before getting to much further into 'Deep Space Nine, are there episodes I should be watching first?",Just started watching Star Trek (Deep Space Nine) for the first time. I'm in love already.
startrek,"Or is it just because we are all cooped up in isolation because of this pandemic? I feel like the negativity towards the new Trek has been more apparent lately. In general, I can't agree with all the hostility being thrown at PIC or DISCO. My Parents are Trekkies and I grew up watching TNG and VOY. And even though PIC has some imperfections, I really enjoyed the story as a whole. Hell, I'm one of the few who loved DISCO season 2 and cannot wait for Season 3.

But come on people. Can we stop with all this hate towards the new Trek? Yeah I get that times are tough, but don't take it out on Kurtzman and Chabon. They are just as much Trekkies as the rest of us. They might not give you the perfect story, but neither would any of us.

I think the problem that New Trek faces, is it can't just be good, it has to live up and outdo the expectations of any Star Trek fan. An episode of PIC or DISCO isn’t compared to the actual quality of your average episode of TNG or TOS, it’s competing with the concept of ‘STAR TREK’ in the collective memories of Star trek fans.

So PIC, which is basically your average peak-tv era show with some fun ideas and details thrown in, gets seen by so many people through this extreme framing that makes it impossible, for a contingent of people to enjoy it for what it is. This is just my take on why the negativity is so bad. 

And I can't emphasize this enough. This is not an attack on the people who have very strong opinions about DISCO and PIC. I just want to help you guys see that perhaps, you are judging the newest Trek, much too hard. I think there was a lot of good that came form PIC season one. And I think the DISCO has a lot to offer too. I hope we can all try see the positives, among these trying times.",Does this community really have so much distaste for new Trek?

Of course, it wasn't suppose to go bad as it was, but even if all went well, it is at least 2-3 hours lost, during which many thing could go wrong, making them lose more time.

Even of the idea was probably from Spock in the beginning, Kirk shouldn't have accepted. It put many lives in danger for basically nothing. There wasn't even coffee in that quasar ;)",Watching TOS: The Galileo Seven
startrek,"I've noticed tensions seem high regarding the series. As someone who didn't like it very much, I thought I'd say some nice things about it.

\-I really liked Elnor. I thought I'd get some cheap shots at the series with a sword-wielding Romulan teenage ninja with a Badass Catchphrase (TM), but they balanced him by showing him as a vulnerable teen who is good at the one thing, but still very young. I liked him quite a bit by the end.

\-Romulan culture. It's weird--well, in character, I guess--that we know so little about the Romulans despite political tension between the Federation and the Romulan Empire lowkey running throughout all of TNG. The notion of rear doors and secret names and ancient demon queens and secret organizations are all aspects of a believable society that bucks the franchise's trend towards being a monoculture.

\-I love Elim Garak, but Narek is the franchise's best spy in my book. He's interested in intelligence, he works assets, he's clever, he solves problems, and he puts aside his personal feelings to do his job. He's an asshole and a Bad Person, but that's the nature of spying. He's miles above Obsidian Order thugs and the omni-competent-because-the-plot-says-so Section 31.

\-Narek's position was an interesting paradigm. He was the one competent person within his organization and also the only one not initiated via deep emotional trauma. It's an analogy for institutional mores and their ability to ostracize rather than learn from deviance. A sharp contrast to what the Federation should be.

\-I liked Seven of Nine. I eventually stopped watching Voyager because of Seven of Nine. I've only picked up a few episodes since and my impression is that as she expressed herself as a person whose personality is determined in no small part by her Borg upbringing that expression is squelched by her captain because it's not ""human enough."" Seeing Seven making her own decisions (for better or worse) and deciding to do something(s) noble seemed real, consequential, and very welcome to me.

\-The interlaced climaxes. Several episodes featured two climactic events happening at the same time with cuts between them. I've seen a few other shows do this (I think Castlevania Season 3 closes out that way), but I haven't seen Star Trek do it before. It was visually interesting and I enjoyed it.

\-Frakes was great. I didn't go in to this feeling as though I needed any particular callback to previous shows, so each one was a treat. Even more than that though, when Frakes said ""shields up!"" my brain thought for a moment that I had Netflix open to a TNG episode in another tab. Dude sent me back in time about 26 years. I enjoyed that they followed up on All Good Things by showing Picard, Riker, and Troi as friends.

\-Troi's is used better than she probably ever was on TNG. Her empathic powers are used to move our story forward and let us express Picard's feelings despite his recalcitrance. Her non-empathic abilities as a counselor are used well to try and help Soji and Picard work together. 

\-Kestra was a welcome character. They had a lot of presence. Also, I watched the episode twice and didn't notice where Kestra was referred to as a 'she' or 'daughter.' I'm positive they were, but until someone corrects me I'm believing they are--despite their affiliation with Thad's warrior women--Trek's first non-binary character.

\-Even putting that aside, Kestra hunts and kills a dangerous creature, which I think is a great touch for kids in Star Trek. They should be as familiar with the elements of their world--the where-does-my-food-come-from and how-does-my-car-go--as we might expect of adults today. Whether that's the woods of Nepenthe or the city of San Francisco, kids who are healthy, fed, and educated since birth should surprise a modern viewer with their knowledge, discipline, and maturity. Kestra demonstrates that and I'm a fan.

\-Those post-Nemesis, pre-Picard uniforms were really nice. I have strong opinions on Star Trek uniforms and they were top tier.

\-Raffi and Rios had a friendship that seemed to grow from a casual association over the series. The moment when she goes to his replicator to get coffee for him instead of booze for herself crystallizes those two being close and it feels like an earned payoff.",I'd like to say some nice things about Star Trek: Picard
startrek,"In this somewhat divisive time in the fandom, can’t we all agree to appreciate Leonard “Bones” McCoy?

He’s the heart of the Enterprise and a gentlemen to boot. He is the most compassionate character in the Original Series, and I would argue, the entire franchise as a whole.

The idea of making him a “simple country Doctor” is actually a genius one. He, through his role as an advisory character, manages to humanise the crew and the show, that at the time ran the risk of alienating the audience. 

When others mention the wonderfully in depth portrayal by Leonard Nimoy, and the charming performance by the Shatner himself, people tend to forget the man who brought such a dynamic character to life.
Deforest Kelley managed to play a grumpy old lovable and kind man we all know and should love.
He set the standard on how the Doctors are written in later shows, and managed to play a hilarious yet important man who always managed to do or say the right thing.

While later Doctors would probably beat him in term of amazing feats, McCoy was always the heart and soul of the Enterprise and became the confidante of one of the popular Captains of all time. 

His speech in Balance of Terror is one of the greatest in tv history. Seriously it’s so good. Go and watch it. It needs to be talked about more. It’s beautiful. 

For these reasons and more, he is my favourite character in the entire Trek universe.",Can We All Just Appreciate McCoy for a Second?
startrek,"35 year Trek fan here. Last year I undertook a complete rewatch of TNG in preparation for the new show, finishing up with Nemesis in January a few days before the premiere. I grew up on TNG and my excitement was through the roof. 

I found Picard to be a solid season of television with some faults throughout, but ultimately satisfying in the end. Despite other people's comments to the contrary, Jean Luc felt very much like Picard to me from the beginning (although changed of course) and it was great to see him become a leader again as the season went on.

Picard season 1 wasn't perfect and I have issues with many aspects of it, from set design to writing decisions, but I always looked forward to each episode and would rate each episode 6 or higher out of 10 (most were probably in the 7 range). Something about the show also felt disjointed from episode to episode at times and I feel like the new characters didn't get enough time to shine/develop. I also think that interesting character aspects, such as Raffi's addiction or most anything about Elnor were completely cut unfortunately. Of course, it has only been 10 episodes so some of these complaints are definitely not fair. I mean look at where the other Trek shows were after 10 episodes!

Prior to the premiere, my expectations were unrealistically very very high. Despite this, I feel like the show mostly met them and I think that says a lot about the great work the writers/directors/cast did.  I also think it is easily Star Trek's best first season.

Bring on season 2!",My Short Picard Review
startrek,"A few months ago I decided to further my Trek education by watching Enterprise. From this subreddit I know it’s not the most popular Trek, but given Voyager is my current favourite, I thought it was worth a watch. I’ll be honest it took me longer to get into, but by the end I’ll admit I liked it. The premise was interesting, and the character development was good. Also Phlox is a delight in every scene he’s in, and as a Brit seeing Reed in Star Trek was very pleasing. 

Anyway, I watched the final episode tonight, and possibly isolation is taking its toll, but I was devastated. Here are my main 3 issues:

1. Simulation
The whole premise of the episode’s story being a holodeck simulation run by Riker really irritated me. The characters I’d grown so attached to being computer programs in their last appearance just felt wrong. His decision to disobey orders was also a league away from Trip’s decision. The whole idea of Riker using a simulation in which he mostly impersonates a chef to make a critical decision just seemed weird.

2. Timing
The timing for the episode was really off. Why did it need to be the day of Enterprise’s decommissioning? Why did it need to be the day of the coalition signing? Six years of adventures just swept over and ignored and it felt very forced. I would have been on board if they fast-forwarded  to the actual forming of the federation, but they didn’t.

3. Trip’s Death 
I know its Trek tradition to kill a major character in a show (Yarr, Kes etc.) but killing them in the last episode is just daft. Especially when its one of the main 3 - the gut punch being entirely negated by it happening a mere 20 minutes before the show ending. What makes character deaths so powerful is watching the characters react and emphasising with them. We got hardly any of that in Trip’s death. It felt so weird and forced I genuinely expected him to emerge from  the shadows and take T’Pol’a hand as Archer gave his speech. 

I understand a lot of my issues stem from it being cancelled before its time. Believe me, I’m no stranger to a rushed ending (I’ve watched BBC’s Merlin) but Enterprise could have ended so perfectly either by just going off into their new adventure (these ARE the voyages) or simply with Archer’s speech in the previous episode.

So there you have it, ramblings about an ending that took place over 10 years ago from someone who barely qualifies as a trekkie. I just wanted to know if the trek community as a whole agreed or disagreed with my view.",Thoughts on Enterprise’s Ending
startrek,"For all people claim that we just want a repeat of TNG, I've never actually seen anyone seriously express this opinion in my 20+ years involvement in this fandom. If anything people criticize ENT and VOY as trying too hard to recreate TNG, and the most popular episodes of those respective shows are the ones that do their own thing.

My issue with Discovery, Picard, and the Bad Robot Films is that they ARE rehashes of the old shows.

Oh boy, another actor to play Spock, another super secret Spock sibling, another super secret Soong family member, tribbles, another evil robot trying to kill the universe, oh boy it's the borg again, oh boy it's klingons again, oh boy it's the mirror universe again, oh boy it's Khan again only he's white this time, oh boy Spock says the Khan line instead of Kirk this time, oh boy it's Sarek again, remember Sarek? I could keep going for days.

Sure, people love to point out episodes like Relics or Unification or Trials and Tribble-ations, but these episodes were exception rather than the rule. By and large Star Trek is not a franchise that references itself often, and even when it does was usually in a way that most people would miss it.

It's notable to me that outside of a couple flashbacks, the Borg never appear in DS9. The Dominon don't show up in VOY or ENT. Outside of a blink and you'll miss it diagram, tribbles never show up in TNG or VOY. These are shows celebrated for their differences rather than their similarities, and the commonalities they do share only serve to enhance the believably of the fictional universe they inhabit. 

I, and I'd wager most Star Trek fans, would have been perfectly happy with a new crew on a new ship boldly going where no man has gone before, commenting on modern political topics like Star Trek has always done. 

Which makes it all the more disappointing that for the last 11 years (and arguably even before that) this franchise has been driving in circles while stuck in first gear, revisiting the same tired characters, same tired tropes, same tired plotlines, and same tired locales. If you took away all the old characters and ""member this"" moments, what would this house of cards have to stand on?

At this point I would be perfectly happy if we never saw Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Tribbles, Klingons, the Borg, Picard, Data, or even the Enterprise itself ever again. I welcome the opportunity for new characters to fall in love with, new ship designs to become my favorite, new iconic aliens to enjoy, and new ideas and political concepts to think about and debate. 

It's a shame I haven't been given the opportunity in a very long time.

If seeing all the old stuff again but with new actors or updated graphics is what does it for you I guess I can't really begrudge you for that. I wish I shared your position, I do like enjoying things believe it or not. But I personally have all my DVD's and BluRays for whenever I wish to relive the past, and more than anything I wish this franchise would give me the opportunity to have new favorites again.",Star Trek is stuck in the past.

startrek,"Early on in the season, I felt that I liked Dahj a lot more than Soji. I thought the feeling was unfounded, they're (almost) the same character, and we barely knew Dahj to begin with. But reflecting on the season as a whole, I feel that the show would have worked a lot better if we'd had Dahj instead of Soji.

Dahj was the everyday character - someone just going about their daily lives, who suddenly has their life upended. She's lost and scared and suddenly apart of something much bigger than she ever imagined. ...A standard sci-fi cliche, sure, but it's standard because it works. Dahj was a bit more relatable and likable for it, whereas Soji had no idea what was going on until 6 episodes in, and then within 1 she had to both come to terms with who she was, and learn to trust Picard. 

Imagine Dahj survives the attempt on her life in the first episode. She now becomes worried for her sister, who she believed worked at a Federation shipyard, but this also turned out to be a lie. Picard promises to help her find and save her sister. 

Dahj is around as the crew is assembled and as they go about looking for Soji. She slowly forms friendships with them in her own way, as she starts to rediscover who she is. At one point she asks Picard about Data, pointing out that with his abilities, he was close to being a perfect human. Picard tells her that Data only used his android abilities when necessary, preferring to do things as humanly as possible. That Data acknowledged that being flawed and imperfect was a significant part of the human experience, as was learning to overcome those flaws.

The Soji/Narek stuff plays out the same, except this time, he successfully kills her. Picard and Dahj get there too late, as the Romulan fleet is off to the Synth homeworld. Dahj is upset over her sister's death, and can't help but to blame Picard. She knows it's unfair, but she can't help but to be disappointed - he promised her, and he let her down.

So when they're on the Synth homeworld, and the other Synths offer her this vision of utopia, she buys into it. She's grieving her sister, disappointed in Picard...what's so great about humans, anyway? They fail and make mistakes and people get hurt because of it.

Picard's appeal to Dahj would then remind her of Data's way of life - accepting failure and flaws, and learning to overcome them. How learning to grow from past mistakes is a part of being human. This would inspire her to believe in Picard and shut down the beacon. And give more weight to the sacrifice Picard was willing to make for her.",Picard: The other sister was better...

What happened to Chakotay? Is he the one that turned her all vigilante with his Maquis mindset? Even the mention of him next season would make me happy.

startrek,"I get that there are a lot of people that like Enterprise or think it's over-hated/underrated. I just don't know if I can watch it right now during quarantine though, the pilot alone made me and my wife quit at the gel-rubbing scene and pick up CBS streaming for Discovery and Picard. 

I have stomached a lot of *hilariously* awful ST plots throughout all the series so far, and nothing in them could have prepared me for how genuinely intolerable and unlikable every character in ENT has been so far. Does it get *any* better for people who are similarly rolling their eyes at the portrayal of the women on the show (not just sexualization tbh) and generally annoyed by the combative nature of everyone on the crew? DS9 and Voyager didn't always have crews be agreeable, cooperative, or even likeable, but it usually was the sum of a compelling plot point, theme, or a character flaw rather than the characters *being the flaw*.

I know the show is already polarizing but ST to me is about philosophy and intellectually stimulating plots, which remain pertinent in the writing even during long war arcs in DS9 or in interpersonal soapy drama episodes of every series. It just doesn't seem like that's in ENT at all. It's like they wanted to make the most boring Michael Bay aspiring sci-fi possible. Is there any hope or should I just skip it? I might go back to it during a less stressful time when I can make ""Space George W. Bush"" into more of a case study but these days I need to actually watch good TV if I watch any at all. I am still laughing at the idea that people actually made this show and that seemingly every single decision about it so far has been completely wrong in the context of Star Trek writing and worldbuilding and characterization.

* In both, the oldest looking version causes the cataclysm (Grandpa/Old Picard)

The people who make these videos are not fans of Star Trek. They exist to farm your views for their own benefit (money).

There is no evidence to support that Picard did bad. Make your own judgments on whether or not you liked it. Every single influencer out there seems to bee unrealistically critical of a show that I enjoyed heavily, and it's creating a toxic (for the lack of a better word, sorry) environment where if TNG came out today, it would be seen as a bad show.

I don't know what these people are expecting, and honestly I don't care.","Star Trek Picard did not ""Fail"", it was in fact a magnificent success (sorry, rant)."
startrek,"1. Filled with incredibly empty 'reluctant hero' gestures: Seven of Nine, Raffi, Rios, and Elnor all had instant ""100% I will not... Okay, I'll go"" moments. This is a problem of writing. Raffi did this shit 3 times.

2. Romulans don't behave like Romulans. It is obvious this is a problem of direction. They behave like humans with some prosthetic ears. The actors appear to be given no guidance as to how a Romulan carries themselves in all other trek.

3. Modern Stylistic/Content choices like: more camera movement, lens flair, hot characters having sexy time, everything looks Green Screen... are okay to have, if it suits the narrative. Instead the camera seems to listlessly move to capture a cool angle when the moment doesn't call for it. This is the problem with Michael Bay. ""Every shot is given equal weight visually."" If everything is of max importance, nothing is important. (Why is it So Hard to Remember What Happens in Transfomers? by Lindsay Ellis provides a perfect example why this is a bad use of film language)

4. Lack of philosophy with an overabundance of attempts to seem profound. This has gotten better in later episodes.

5. At this point it doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. This is a different show. I understand that. Enterprise didn't really feel like Star Trek some of the time to me. But this has very fleeting moments of being Star Trek. Like it is just using the Trek mythology and world very little at that.

6. Picard is not inspiring. This is very jarring to a Star Trek fan and to me diminishes the whole point of the show. This has gotten better in later episodes and perhaps this is a part of the narrative growth for Picard.

7. It ignores the history of the galaxy. Voyagers return and the Dominion War have had no mention or seemingly no impact on geopolitical nature of the Galaxy. 

8. Not talking to the computer and hearing the computer respond is such an atmospheric Star Trek thing that is absent here.

9. Elnor should not have been convinced to leave but rather trying to convince Picard to go with him. This was backwards.

10. Soji &amp; Narek sleep on a way too small bed.

&amp;#x200B;

What Picard is doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Transformation of the Borg to a defeated resource that scavengers are exploiting is really amazing.

2. Agnes is perfect. Her character has been told perfectly so far. The reveal of her romantic connection with Maddox was handled, beautifully and provided my first moment of real emotional devistation. 

3. The EMH's have a similar dynamic that made the Voyager EMH doctor such a good character.

4. The Innari bodyguard (Vop) is a great Star Trek type species. Distinctly NOT Human. Maybe there should be more of this?

5. The Federation fucking itself up so badly by devolving into racism and shitty self-important leaders, would seem impractical... if it wasn't happening so vividly in real life. This is a big plus.

6. The conspiracy unraveling itself is an example of good writing. The ban, the federation, the Romulans hatred of Synthetics. All interesting questions.

7. Stardust City Rag was the first very good episode because of the swerve involving Sevens past with the Freecloud Boss (a very good villain btw). The costuming, the atmosphere, even the pacing was star trek and more importantly good storytelling. When Agnes did the thing at the end (another perfect and justified swerve) I was flabberghasted and all-in.

I guess my biggest gripe is that I do wish there was more of that classic heartfelt ""diplomacy"" and overall wholesome vibe that the past Trek shows had in my opinion.",Getting caught up on Discovery

startrek,"Question for the shared brains trust.

My wife and I are watching DS-9 - we are both Star Trek fans and have watched pretty much every other series.  We have tried DS-9 in the past and just faded away and started watching something else.  Having said that, it is regularly billed as one of the best Star Trek series around, so we thought we'd give it another go.

We are up to Season 1 Episode 16 and we have been struggling.   The episode where Jake and Nod buy  Cardassian yamok sauce?   We skipped it entirely.  Boring and cringey.

Some of the acting is excruiciating.  Watching Avery Brookes as he ""Enunciates.  Every.  Word.  In.  A.  Sentence"".  Some of the character motivations are hard to understand (Hey, Bashir, we get that you like Dax, but can't you take a hint).  Some of the plot lines end up feeling a bit cringeworthy.

Every Star Trek series took a season or so to get going - TNG wasn't brilliant in its first season, it always felt like an 80s TOS to me but once it got its legs, it was great.  Voyager was stronger in its first season, but also improved over time.  

We aren't quite ready to give up yet, but when does it get good?",Watching DS-9 and struggling
startrek,"In the years after Enterprise, I had two good ideas for Star Trek. One was just a *NEXT* Next Generation. Go on more adventures, with well written stories. I fully reject the concept of Franchise Fatigue. The problem with Trek back then was that the shows simply got bad. But that's not what this is about....

The second idea I had was to have a show that was about the origins of the Borg. But my idea was that it wouldn't be labeled as that. Or even called a Star Trek show. It would be a ""general"" sci fi show about the future that at the end would surprise you by the people in the show ending up becoming the borg.

Today, we are all stuck at home for months. Luckily we have enough technology that we can connect with each other virtually which is good. We are all adjusting our lives so that we can do our jobs and do what we need to do, while minimizing direct contact.

What a great seed for a borg origin story. A virus forces everyone to stay apart and connect electronically. In a civilization with much more advanced technology, and with a quarantine that lasts hopefully a lot longer than our is going to, our every deepening personal connections to the internet could evolve into a collective.",This would make a great borg origin story
startrek,"I'm watching ""What We Left Behind"" and the response of DS9 at the time and it's very similar to the reaction that Picard just received. Here's the thing, though, cussing aside, DS9 was waaaay darker in tone than Picard. 

 One of the heroes was a former terrorist who showed no regret for her actions, in fact she's proud of them ffs. They even mention in the documentary that they wouldn't be able to get away with some of that stuff today. Not to mention that some of the decisions Sisko made during the Dominion War. Hell, the Dominion War itself. If Nostalgic fanboys are shitting themselves over a Starfleet admiral swearing, imagine their reaction at how Sisko handled the Maquis!

  I smirked when one of the hate letters they read called DS9 ""too politically correct."" The more shit changes the more it stays the same.",How do you think DS9 would've been received today?
startrek,"It happened to coincide that I watched during the same week the finale of both Picard ans DS9. The interesting thing was how similar both endings were in terms of messed-up events with bad editing. 

I found Picard more ambitious since it inherits 33-year long Data's storyline, extending Soongs, too. The clash between the fleets felt like a true Star Trek (that classic tension on-screen between the adversaries), but it lasted only seconds. And the death of Picard might have been explored far deeper providing he had died several times during TNG (we DO KNOW how and who could ""restore"" Jean-Luc in his genuine human sleeve). I could only imagine how the series would have looked like if not under Kurtzman production...

In DS9, the ending was mostly anticipated, but implemented a bit better. It managed to wrap up multiple arcs, although in a bit unnatural and puzzling way (and one in just appaling). Sometimes it felt like 4- or-5-episode long story was chopped off awkwardly missing many emotional scenes. Fortunately, far less that in Picard.

In both series, we didn't see the ultimate battle of/with supernatural beings - the major flaw IMO. But unlike the Prophets from DS9, we weren't explained convincingly what was the danger/nature of ""the makers of the Admonition"" in Picard.

I mentioned bad endings for some characters in DS9, but it was dictated by the fact of 7-season long build-up. In Picard, such flaw was of much larger scale: why the hell noone noticed the disappearance of Narek? Why Agnes suddenly dodged the justice of murdering Bruce Maddox? The logic of Soji was just random, she behaves in final episode like drunken teenager who also have bipolar disorder.

The coherence of the events were flawed sometimes in horrendous way.  Picard and Agnes escaped the synthetic guards, walked towards the cube, had a talk, repaired the ship, launched up in front of the Romulan fleet that all the time was doing what?... Meanwhile Soong just busy with routine data extraction and Seven probably meditating over her killing Narissa. 

In this aspect DS9 is even worth: we saw two characters chatting around in a cave - like a 15-minute scene, when a long Galactic-scale battle is raged far away, then ended, the whole fleet went back to docks, war-ending formalities had been made and even a nice party held at Fontain's holosuite... not to mention Sisko suddenly becoming a Jedi who knows how to find exact spot on Bajor to face the enemy who's expects him doing just that!

To sum up, Picard was a bad series which ended up in awckwardly good, ""acceptable"" way. What You Leave Behind, instead, is a tight kaleidoscope, not bad yet still not enough for a brilliant saga.

I enjoyed Et in Arcadia Ego a bit more, mostly emotionally. Despite hating Discovery and all this dung associated with Kurtzman.

What would you say?",Picard's vs DS9 endings?
startrek,"After seeing the trailer for season 3 of Discovery, i was pretty excited, but some memory in the back of my head was bugging me. It took me a while to retrieve it, but then I remembered Kevin Sorbo doing a slow kick around a black hole and it all came back to me. Andromeda: a sci fi series about a crew from a United ""commonwealth"" of planets, flung into the future where their peace loving system of intragalactic government had failed, trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild a better future. All based on unused story ideas by, what was his name? Ah here it is...Gene Roddenberry. Sound familiar? 

I was surprised to find out the show had 5 seasons! I watched it a lot and liked it as a kid, but I really remember almost nothing from it now. I was wondering in general if anyone else remembered it and if they felt there were any lessons Discovery season 3 should take from a show with a nearly identical story concept.

startrek,"So I've had some thoughts after the end of Picard S1, Discovery, the history of Star Trek, the vociferous fanbase, and some issues regarding modern ST creation. I'm going to keep this short so hopefully discussion can happen.

• Modern Star Trek is being made in season-long story arcs because the production company never knows if the plug will be pulled. This to me is sad.  Picard S1 was good, I liked it, but man that whole season could be the entire series. Seven becoming interim queen should have had much more drama around it. Now we're going to get another season of rushed storytelling simply because the writers are likely barred from planning that far out. Can you imagine if in DS9 the Dominion War was only allowed to be one season? It causes rushed story telling, and the overall thing suffers.  
  \- Discovery does this too. Its becoming a theme with ST.

• I really DO love what they're doing though. They are truly creating some proper fan service by going deep in the lore. I love that, there's an entire universe to utilize, no reason to keep making new enemies, things, and what not.

• All in all I'm happy with modern ST. Even with rushed story telling, I'm happy we're seeing modern trek. I do worry the fanbase will serve to destabilize this all though. We need to collectively regulate ourselves.","Many problems, many strengths. Contains general spoilers."
startrek,"SPOILERS

I don't buy the Romulans backing down in the finale of *Picard*. Like, if they seriously believe that the synths are going to bring about a galactic apocalypse, than no way are they going to back down just because of a Picard speech about their rights as sapients and a comparably-sized Federation fleet. If they really believe that the galaxy will be destroyed if they don't act, they absolutely would have opened fire on the fleet and attempted to break through to destroy the planet.

Plus, the synths DID IN FACT ACTIVATE the beacon summoning the genocidal extra-galactic AIs, which would absolutely convince the Romulans that they were right all along in their fear of them. And Narek spent that time narrating the Romulan myth of streets being flooded with the blood and entrails of the innocent because these machines.

startrek,"I just rewatched Nemisis again and as I was watching it I thought that the story really isn't that bad but the fact that Tom Hardy looks absolutely nothing like Patrick Stewart really makes the movie hard to believe.  
  
Despite the fact that Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor it's just too hard to accept that he is a younger version of Patrick Stewart. They have nothing in common. Their voices sound nothing alike, they have totally different accents, different lips, and their facial structure is completely different. They tried to explain this away by saying that Shinzon was disfigured but last time I checked no amount of fighting will give you fuller lips. In fact they only thing that they even had in common at all is that they were both bald although that didn't even make any sense seeing as every time we have seen young Picard had hair.  
  
I think that if they had casted a different actor to play Shinzon people's opinions of the film would be completely different.",Nemesis would have been so much better if the actor they got for Shinzon looked more like Patrick Stewart.
startrek,"First of all, I really like Voyager so far, but hear me out.

The most obvious offender is Chakotay. It seems all he does is talk about his Native American heritage, which would be weird enough in any show, but seems especially odd in Star Trek when we are supposed to be in a post-nations post-racial future. There is a TOS episode where Abraham Lincolm remarks about Uhuru being integrated into the crew, but Kirk and all the others are so advanced in their thinking they can't even understand what Lincoln is talking about.

This would be less of an issue if Chakotay has a more defined character, but after watching a season and a half all I can tell you about him is basically a series of Native American cliches, with none of the characterization you would expect from a leader of rebels.

He's a pretty common complaint, and I get that the writers were scammed but a fake consultant, but I think theres a few other odd issues in Voyager.

The character of Tuvak seems vaguely racist to me in that the show runners seemed to think that simply making a vulcan black was a character trait. I mean its great to have a diverse cast, but so far there is nothing to differentiate him from Spock, or any other generic Vulcan, except for his skin color. It almost seems to me, the showrunners said, hey lets have a black vulcan, and then stopped writing there. Contract this to the great characterization of Geordi, whose skin color is literally irrelevant to his character. I can tell you that he is a good friend, probably the nicest TNG character, and bad with the ladies. I cant tell you a whole lot about Tuvak.

Please note im not really complaining or calling Voyager racist really. Most of this I think is just mediocre writing. I just find it interesting that it was clearly well intentioned but went wrong, and wrong in ways previous crews from earlier eras didn't go as wrong. Also things you should be aware of if you are writing anything...",Is Voyager accidentally racist?

It would have been a little bit more cooler to see Rikers new ship to come swooping in to save the day like how the Enterprise E did in First Contact when the Borg invasion on Earth was happening. The way they do it now is the ships instantaneously pop into a exact place and disappear instantly. Anyone else feel the same way?",How starships go into and drop out of Warp Speed

Cmder Oh then claims she has a small fleet on standby near earth ready to seed earth's atmosphere with poisonous radiation if they do so. Riker accuses her of bluffing. She reminds him she infiltrated the deepest reaches of Star Fleet and no one was the wiser, it would be foolish to assume she is bluffing. 

Stand off. 

Picard chimes in and proposes that the communication tower to call Cthulhu is destroyed, all tech and info related to it is destroyed, and that the knowledge of the ability to call the interdimensional destroyers is completely erased from the memory banks of all synths. 

The Synths have a conference and accept this under once condition - The Federation remove the synth ban and give synths full citizenship. 

Picard talks to Federation big wigs, they agree. 

AI Soong oversees the procedure as one after another of the synths has the knowledge permanently removed and all the tech is destroyed. ONce that happens, Cmdr Oh is satisfied, she backs down and returns. 

This way everyone (mostly) gets what they want and the Romulans are not portrayed as 2 dimensional bad guys which bothered me.

Say there’s a Betazoid in StarFleet whose job was to make contact with new life. If they could read their minds, wouldn’t it just be gibberish to them?
 The universal translator wouldn’t affect their thoughts presumably.
So how then can they seemingly read the minds of nearly anyone without the issue of a language barrier?

Also what’s the law regarding telepaths? Surely on their planet most crime wouldn’t exist considering they don’t really lie all that much. (At least to each other.) Could a Telepath be used in a court of law? We know this happened during the Klingon War, but that was in desperate times.

Side note considering it takes them until adolescence to develop their abilities, do you think the children try to lie? At least to each other? Or is it just so completely alien to them that they wouldn’t consider it?

startrek,"TL;DR - The way she saves the day is by using her abilities to effectively steer Picard away from bad decision making (especially within his specialty of negotiations), to make him aware of things he would otherwise not be able to perceive, and to essentially save the crew from disaster by avoiding it in the first place rather than solving the crisis after it's a problem.

Many people in this fandom seem to view Troi less than favourably. I won't speak to any reasons other than frequent mentions of her generally not being very useful.

I know a lot of you will be prompted to disagree that this is the case, but we can only speak from personal experience and this is the point of view I'm coming from so if all you're going to say is ""what? everyone I know loves her"", I hear you, save your effort.

I'm rewatching TNG and it's occurred to me why this might be, even though in my opinion it is wrong. It seems like there's a key difference in how Troi is useful as opposed to the other characters around her.

For example, Data, Geordi and Crusher tend to chew on a problem and propose or create actionable solutions to solve the main crisis.

Picard likes to have a last-minute revelation and think or talk his way out of a problem, while Riker and Worf tend to be more action-oriented and reactive in their heroics. All these characters often get their moments in a very memorabel, climactic way.

I don't think it can be overstated how useful Troi is, just in a way more subtle and totally different way. Her moments aren't as easy to remember, but they are way more frequent than most other characters.

Sure, sometimes she doesn't have very much to offer when asked her opinion (I won't get into how that is also useful sometimes) but it's worth noting that she is indeed repeatedly asked.

Often she has helpful insight, which may seem obvious points to us based on storytelling clues but are at least helpful in confirming what Picard may be guessing at.

But more frequently, she is actively useful in bringing forth new information the crew wouldn't have otherwise, including sensing certain things on an entirely imperceptible level to the rest of them. They'd be screwed without her in many cases.

Her abilities can't be overlooked. I don't need to walk anyone through why her abilities are useful in theory, any level of mind reading is obviously an asset. But I've never seen anyone go out of their way to point out how finely tuned her senses are, sometimes she is very specific in her descriptions (even though the meme is that she is always vague, or else just stating the obvious).

Not only are they specific, they're also broad and powerful. She can feel and sense things thousands of kilometers away, from thousands of individual complex entities at a time. On top of everyone in the ship around her. That would take incredible strength to handle and would make her an incredibly useful asset especially in her job which, by the way, is also a very necessary thing to have on a ship out in space that long even if it were a position filled by a human.

This won't be news to most of you but I know some people need to hear it.",In defense of Troi
startrek,"As is well known at this point, the premise of Breaking Bad was simple: turn Mr. Chips into Scarface. But how it would be done or what would happen along the way wasn't predetermined. Instead, the writers wrote organically. As described in countless behind-the-scenes podcasts and interviews, in determining how to create the story, the writers simply asked themselves episode to episode, ""Where's a character's head at?"" and ""What happens next?"" The television equivalent of one-step-at-a-time. This way, character choices and plot moves seem plausible, and the characters gain depth.
Contrast this with Star Trek: Picard, which seems to have been created with a checkbox approach. We need to get them from here to here, so what can we come up with to make that happen? Or we want to establish this about this character, so what can we come up with to show that? Check, check, check. This approach is what leads to moments not feeling earned. This is how you end up with plot holes. This is how you end up with thinly-written characters, poor pacing, and coincidences that are too hard to believe. I am certain that 80% of the problems that people have with this show are the casualties of this writing approach. The most blatant example to me is Elnor. He's fine as a character, but there's no reason he needs to be on the crew other than the writers decided it would be cool to have someone like him round out the team. And what you end up with is this huge detour to pick him up, some maudlin backstory to establish their relationship, and some forced drama about whether Elnor will go with him or not. Another example is the writers wanting to establish that Raffi has some past demons to contend with. Insert dramatic scene with son. Check.
If you're going to revolve a whole television series around a character, and declare upfront that it's meant to be a slower, character-driven show, then the writing approach should match. As it is right now, it's like the show is constructed by patchwork, and I can feel and see every seam. ",Recommendation to Picard's showrunners: adopt Breaking Bad's approach to writing.

startrek,"When I was about 10 years old I started watching TNG and VOY with my dad, he introduced me to Star Trek. Just a few years later I watched TNG, VOY and the old Movies several times, when I became older I also watched DS9 (On of my favorite Trek!), ENT and TOS. Now I'm 19 and I couldn't be happier to see Picard again, the 30 year old show I always loved got a sequel! And it was beautiful, it was a fantastic season! It really is the Star Trek I always wanted. I loved the story, the writing, the characters, the romulans, the borg, the androids the overall look and feel, for me almost everything was perfect. I couldn't be happier.

This will be probably my last post and comment for a long time here. Thank you for some nice moments and &gt;!f\*\*\* you to those who are full of negativity and hate...!&lt;, but I decided to leave this and other Star Trek related things. Bye.",Star Trek: Picard is the Trek show I always wanted.
startrek,"People seem to want that. I'm not sure why. TNG would have sucked if it was just TOS (and the first season did suck, one of the worst offenders being a TOS rehash). DS9 would have sucked if it were just TNG (and people were initially pissed it wasn't). Voyager missed the boat largely on being too safe trek with not too many fresh ideas despite being across the galaxy with all new species. I feel like if Star Trek creators ever ""respected"" the old material the way the fanbase wants them to, everything would still be TOS, most of the stuff the modern fanbase adores wouldn't exist, and the franchise would be deader than doornails. Star trek has never been old star trek and has consistently sucked when it has tried.

startrek,"Let me start off by saying that I am very grateful that we are getting new Star Trek shows for the first time in over a decade, however, I can’t help but feel that the producers are prioritizing the amount of new series they put out rather than the quality of those shows. I just finished Picard and it’s pretty obvious at many times throughout the show (probably one of the most anticipated Trek series ever) that it was quite rushed and not given NEARLY the budget it deserved. (Did they prioritize the budget for Discovery?? If so, that was a mistake…) And now with all the other series announced (that nobody asked for or really cares about.) I can’t help but think that the producers/CBS are intentionally or unintentionally diluting the quality of Star Trek so they can pump out all these extra series.

I think that Star Trek should be run by producers who truly care and understand the show and are fans themselves. They should choose one or two stories that audiences would love best and invest their budget and time there. I grew up with Trek and it’s my favorite show(s), and I’m worried that I’m not gonna like where this is going. Let me know if it’s just me, but I doubt that it is.","I believe we are facing a dilution problem with all the new Star Trek shows coming out, and that the producers should stick to quality over quantity."

startrek,"Just in case you don't know: Mass Effect is a series of computer/console games. The Storyline is, that every 50k years an outergalactic species arrives and kills all species with a certain level of technology. These aliens are called ""The Reaper"".

During the first three games we, as gamer, found out about the threat, about the background of the reason why the reaper do what they do and even meet someone who witnessed the last ""purge"" (stasis is a hell of a tech). Long story short: Organics built tech, tech became consious, both fight, organics loose, tech hibernates for 50k to kill everything that could be a threat... repeat.

At the end of the third game  we face 3 different endings:

1. Destroy the reapers and ALL (!) synthetic life, even the friendly one
2. the hero(ess) takes control over the reapers, in exchange for sacrificing his/her body. The hero becomes an AI himself/herself and the reapers become ""slaves""
3. Synthesis of organic and synthetic life forms. All lifeforms (organic and synth) merge and form new lifeforms (but they keep the apperiance). In fact, Humans e.g. end up as creatures like Picard is at the end of Season 1.

A lot of Picard reminded me of Mass Effect: Synths fighting for their lives and rights (Geth), while others see them as threats and mortal enemy (Quarians/Romulans).

startrek,"I just wanted to say that, as a UK viewer, i've had to go to some lengths to avoid spoilers for ST:Picard. Every Thursday I had to remind myself to unsbscribe from r/startrek and r/DaystromInstitute, and I had a long list of muted words on Twitter: ""#STPicard"", ""Romulan"", ""Soji"", etc etc. Unbelievably I was 100% successful, and barring the trailers and the next time segment on the Ready Room I came to each episode entirely fresh and unspoiled.

Then, this week, Jonathan Frakes posted to Twitter a photo of himself in a captain's chair, in the sweet new Starfleet uniform, with the caption ""Social distancing"" - neither of which were, obviously, among my muted words. I don't even follow Frakes but there he was in my timeline.

And you know what? It's fine. Not because it was a fairly predictable plot development (although it was), but because somehow Jonathan ""no fucks given"" Frakes carelessly dropping plot spoilers has become such a tradition that it would almost be disappointing to me if he didn't. And he looked damn good back in uniform.",Thank you Frakes

startrek,"I think I've got a different take on Picard... and it relates back to Discovery and the Kelvin timeline.

I went in to Picard with HIGH hopes, and was fully let down, but I couldn't identify why. I think all new generation of ST content has become ""Star Wars"" more than ""Star Trek"". Many people argue, ""Hey old man, the new ST is great! It makes it more accessible to new fans! Just be happy to grow the base!""

I'm actually **happy** there are people who enjoy the new content. That's nice! But old ST was in a totally different genre than Star Wars. To grossly oversimplify, Star Wars is an underdog story. (Bear with me... please forget what you've heard about ""the hero's journey"" which I argue is just an epic version of the underdog story). When you look at Star Wars... or Fast-and-Furious... or Avengers... it's all about being the underdog. The protagonist(s) fight against an impossible foe and then rise above all obstacles overcome the big-evil. It's a great conceit. It's why the new ST is so accessible for new fans. Who doesn't love a good underdog story?

But that's not classic ST. TOS crew were explorers... and they had confidence. They were part of the noble Federation. They may be isolated, and get into trouble because they were on the frontier, but BEHIND THEM was the full weight (and moral fortitude) of the Federation. The story basically set itself up as... ""okay, we've solved all those other basic conflicts in life. There's no push for basic survival, or wealth, or power, or resources. Now we focus on exploring what's-out-there, and at the same time we explore what-it-means-to-be-human, what-we-can-aspire-to-be."" (Exploring both inner and outer space).

So why the new ST iterations are disappointing *for me* is that I went in with different expectations. It'd be like walking into the next Fast And The Furious and getting a light-hearted rom-com. Or going to see the next Avengers movie and getting a teen coming-of-age-story. Even if the rom-com F&amp;F was faaaaantastic, I'd wager the folks that walked in there expecting high-octane action would be let down.

So in conclusion, I'm **happy** that new fans can get a story line they find exciting and engaging while watching Disco, Picard, or Kelvin. I'm happy there's people that can get to know Kirk, Picard and Burnham^(\*ahem\*), and see them as heroes. I wouldn't want to take that away from anyone. I personally don't find Star Wars all that engaging, but look at the fan base! I'm stoked all those folks can find so much joy in the SW saga. I just hope at some point there will be more content (Star Trek or otherwise) that focuses on the human element of exploration, and doesn't feel the need to make another underdog story.",Picard is not my Star Trek (and that's okay)

Maybe Doctor Who style where there are big over-arching season long stories, but told through smaller vignettes that let us just hang out with the characters a little bit. I think the cast they have assembled is great,  I want to get to know what they are like when not in a life and death race to do . . . something.

I remember watching one of the Kelvin Timeline films (I honestly can't remember which) and there was a throw away line about some little adventure that they went on where they didn't blow up the Enterprise and I realized how much I wanted to see that. That cast also had great potential, but for me the fun of trek is seeing the dynamics of these great people being people and working together to do the thing because it was right, not necessarily because the fate of the universe hung in the balance. I want to see Rios and Picard disagree about something where the stakes aren't so high, but neither of them is wrong and you get to see their points of view.","Picard S1 was good, now can we get more monster of the week?"
startrek,"Am I the only one who finds that the ships on 'Picard' and 'Discovery' look really different from the Trek designs in the TNG/DS9/VOY era?

The ship designs in TNG era by Andrew Probert, Greg Jein, Rick Sternbach were in my opinion elegant, weighty and memorable. Think of the designs for the Enterprise-D Galaxy-class, Romulan D'deridex, Klingon Vor'cha. They were instantly memorable, beautiful to look at from every angle.

And you could trace each ships' design language back to the classic era Star Trek ships - the Vor'cha class was an evolution of the iconic K't'inga class from The Motion Picture and TOS tv show. The Galaxy class and (its contemporary Starfleet ships) were an evolution from the TOS Constitution class, adopting the graceful curves of the movie-era Excelsior, Miranda and Oberth classes. Even the D'deridex took the TOS 'bird' motif and made it into a literal 'Bird-of-Prey' personified.

Throughout the TNG-DS9-VOY-ENT history, Star Trek has always followed and honored a consistent design language. You can see this rule followed in the rest of the lesser seen ships - the Nebula-class science ships, Akira-class battleships, the Olympic-class (Pasteur) medical ships, the Klingon Negh'var ships and even the runabouts and various shuttlecrafts that launched from the Ent-D and Voyager shuttlebays.

For a show that is happy to build on / make money off of us fans' (enormous) goodwill from the Star Trek canon, the new VFX / Starship design team seems perfectly content to piss on Star Trek's rich design history, and come up uglier and more forgettable designs. I got my first taste of this with Discovery, when the Federation and Klingon ships were a bunch of clashing colors, all-too-busy design details that belonged more in a Michael Bay Transformer robot travesty, than on any recognizable Star Trek.

I had hoped that Picard would turn the tide, and bring us a long-awaited return to the TNG-design language, but the ship designs for the La Sirena, Riker's 200 copy-pasted fleet, and to a lesser extent the Zhat Vash's Romulan fleet all had forgettable designs that made me think they were made quickly, digitally, in a mercenary fashion. They did not seem crafted lovingly by their sculptors from hand, as I'm sure Probert, Sternbach and Jein had to, in the 80s and 90s. Many in our subreddit pointed out that Riker's fleet looked like a poor digital kitbash of Star Trek Online ships, and I have to agree.

Every time I see ships in 'Discovery' or 'Picard', I have to wince a little at the poor, bland, or messy designs and try to paint over it with better designs in my head. Surely the shuttlecraft in 2399 flying over the Golden Gate Bridge cannot look worse than the ones in TNG S2-S7? And surely they don't have to sport bright red spots of paint that make them look like off-brand imitations of the real thing? This reminds me of how the J.J. Abrams TIE Fighters added unnecessary spots streaks of paint, making them worse than the iconic TIE Fighters of the original SW trilogy.

Without an explanation for the regressions in design, I'm forced to conclude that either Star Trek's new batch of VFX people are incompetent ship designers, or they have little to no respect for the Star Trek history and ships that became before, and are determined to force in their own, original lesser stamps on the franchise.

And speaking of VFX, how is it that hand phasers in 'Picard' have reverted to bullet-style pulses? Is it because assault rifles are in vogue in today's world, so 2399 uses pulse weapons too?

And in the few moments we see traditional 'sustained' phaser beams used in starship battles on 'Picard', they sound tinnier/wimpier than the phaser sounds from the TNG-VOY era. In addition to losing VFX language, did the 'Picard' team lose the sound .wav files from the TNG era too, or did they think their new sound effects were superior?

It's all very baffling, and these poor design choices gnaw at me during my watches of 'Picard' and 'Discovery'. When Wil Wheaton interviews the VFX designer for 'Picard' and presumably 'Discovery', who seems rather proud of his messy VFX work, I find myself actively hating on that person, and wishing I could punch them in the face and give them a wake up call.

I don't believe that CBS skimped on their budget to make the ships beautiful. The production values on both 'Discovery' and 'Picard' seem movie-quality. It seems like no expense was spared. And the big piles of cash Netflix and Amazon Prime forked over for exclusive global streaming rights surely would have paid for a good VFX team.

I don't want to dump on the VFX team too much. I do think the holographic controls used in 2399 Starfleet are a good update to the starship consoles we saw on TNG-DS9-VOY. And Rios/Cristobal manages to make those controls look cool while piloting the La Sirena.",Starship designs and VFX on 'Picard' and 'Discovery'

startrek,"because Patrick Stewart sees something great in the show's potential. He believed in it enough to bring back his character after twenty years. I would say I see that potential in a lot of the cast. Like others have said, I would totally watch a show starring Rios. I also know the show has a finite end, so that gives me some hope.

What's frustrating is the writing, which I know is a big deterrent for a lot of folks. It's obvious to me that the writers are trying to find their footing in the vast Star Trek universe and had bumps along the road. I also think the show would have been much better if it wasn't 10 episodes, and was the traditional 20-22 per season because the pacing would have made more sense. However, given the budget of the show it doesn't seem like that was realistic. 

And at the end of the day, how many of us sat through the first seasons of TNG? Voyager? DS9? All the first seasons of those series were hard to watch for me. I genuinely believe season 2 will be better and hopefully they'll look over the scripts. It would be great if they brought in some of the writers from DS9 too.

startrek,"To be blunt I didn't like Picard very much. I went in with high hopes that were killed off after the first episode. Remembrance was like a new spin on a favorite comfort food. There was enough nostolgia to scratch that itch and enough newness that made it feel different to TNG. Episodes 1-3 were mostly pleasant and then for me it fell off a cliff, with each coming episode a rock hitting me on the way down. 

If it wasnt for for the old cast and crew of TNG and VOY I wouldn't even have watched the rest of the season. None of the new characters had time to breath and develop. Agnes was forgettable. Rios was just another hot headed Latino stereotype ala Po in the Star Wars sequels. Raffi downright creeped me the hell out for some reason. I found her switching from drunken junkie to mother figure (while well acted and would totally work in something like Moonlight) out of place and jarring in this show. Seven I felt was reduced down into kick-ass token LGBT character who for some reason without any development or explanation is hooking up with Raffi? 

And finally there is the man himself Picard who is a broken down husk of himself. The man who was assimilated by the Borg, lived a lifetime in 20 seconds, and saved the Galaxy from certain doom numerous times now is told to fuck off at every chance and is berated in front of the entire galaxy on the evening news. Most of the time Picard in this new series took a backseat turning into a secondary character on his own damn show. The only times when I began to become slightly engaged with his character was when there were TNG call backs and in the finale when he took command of La Sirena (which made me smile).

I get it that all of the characters are suffering through some sort of trauma and the message of how we as individuals and as a society can become cold and distant after trauma is utterly brilliant. It's far better than TNG's Troi rape of the week and move on. But the format of ten episodes completely kills any chances of meaningful character interaction. It's structure is go go go and two minutes of heavy crying. The show didn't feel contemplative like it was advertised, it was a two hour blockbuster movie with eight hours tacked on to blow the special effects budget. Not once did I feel that the main cast was a crew, everyone felt like asshole grifters coming together for a paycheck from the old man. When Picard was dying all I could keep thinking was ""please no, not here with these people!"".

Compare that to Discovery which I didn't like that much either for reasons already well known but had it's moments even in the first episode of season 1.  It was apparent that the crew of the Shenzhou were a family and Michael betrayed that trust to her crew and the federation as a whole. Throughout season 1 she works to regain the trust of her family in both Saru and the federation.  Season 1 also had a great bottle episode ""Magic to make the sanest man go mad"" and the other away mission episode with the sentient resonance plants. Season two worked on that Bond between the crew with scenes like the auto antonym game between Lionel and Reno. Or even the humble brag Michael messaged to Tilly regarding her command test scores. Hopefully season three continues building on that good foundation.

Call me stuck in the past but Star Trek really works when the crew is a family. What made TOS so unique to other Scifi is that the Enterprise was not only a spaceship but it was a home and the crew was a family. Without that Trinity or ensemble of characters it isn't Trek it's just Scifi with trek looking ships.",[Spoilers] St:Pic is making me like Discovery more

The Synths really did have an ancient hook up that would allow them to ***destroy all life in the galaxy***! Shouldn't they maybe get a little credit for that? Like isn't that a threat you would like to be aware of and maybe take guard against? Possibly? 

But instead in the end Riker bullied Oh into leaving, Oh just sort of shrugs her shoulders and retreats, and Riker says he will escort them back as if they were naughty children who can't be trusted or something. What the hell? 

In the very least the Romulans should have stood their ground and gotten some kind of guarantee that the call button for Cthulhu would be permanently and irreversibly destroyed forever. But no, not even that. 

And the Star Fleet just says ""Oh you came a hairs breadth away form destroying all life in the Galaxy? Cool, we will then rescind our ban on synths""

In episode 4, Absolute Candor, they go to Vashti. How the F does this poor planet afford plantary shield and defense platform? I don't recall any other planet in Star Trek with a plantary shield. Is this now standard at the dawn of the 25th century?  

Agnes Jurati murdered Bruce Maddox and everyone knows it. By the end of the season every act like all's forgiven or something.  

Near the end of the last episode we see Picard's death scene witnessed by most of the crew. They all weep, but when he comes back onto the ship no one reacts. It's as if nothing happened.  

With Picard's ressurection it's now cannow that in the Star Trek universe there exists technology to ressurect people. They also made synth body expiration optional. What implications does this have on the future of Star Trek?  

It was never explained why the Zhat Vash syths are the harbigers of doom. Why is that vision they get so convincing? Agnes, a scientist, was so convinced by the vision that Oh gave her that she lost all moral judgement? WTF?!?!",Unanswered questions about Star Trek Picard
startrek,"I know Picard isn't supposed to be starfleet-centric, and I'm okay with that, but I want to see more of the Starfleet of this new era, especially after the Synth Ban has been revoked and things are seemingly getting back to normal. I want a new crew doing Star Trekky things on a weekly basis in the late 2390s, exploring the landscape of that era -- whether that be the lingering aftermath of the Dominion War, reintegrating android research into the Federation or new, unexplained phenomena. Heck a show featuring a re-instated Captain Rios would be just fine by me.",I REEALLY Want a starfleet-centric show in the era of Star Trek: Picard.
startrek,"This is a complaint I have had for quite a long time and in different shows. Just some examples from Discovery:  the total disregard towards the established Klingon design, culture and technology. The infamous 18AU distance starbase. The impact of the spore drive. The fact that the spore drive is not even hinted at in existing canon. 

More recently from Picard's last episode: The needless inflation in ships (four romulan ships would have sufficed for the same story). The fact that certain technologies found on that planet are seemingly limitless (the repair Gizmo, the golem, the transmitter). Leaving the Borg cube completely unused and irrelevant for the story. 

I think the worst is that apparently no one is interested in sustainable story telling. How could the ship ever be damaged in season 2? Just pull out the Gizmo. How many synthetic lifeforms will there be after one more year? Where is their limit? Who will try to open such a portal next?

And all that would have been easy to reconcile. The transmitter could have been dependent on some exotic Borg tech. The synths could have been built using some ancient but limited artifacts from that planet. New stories and drama would arise quasi automatically.

startrek,"I strangely wanted to record this and I'm not sure why, but I thought if anybody you people might appreciate this because like the UFP you guys are generally warm and inviting types.

I dream often about the Enterprise crew, did as a teen as well and like many things in my dreams star trek and its various characters have been symbols. I don't often understand the symbolism nor why various people, places, and things are inserted into those dreams but I've come to learn that the high school/college setting that pops up often is about releasing my anxiety. I often have to complete some task that is nonsensical and inevitably dream confusion sets in making the task impossible.

Tonight was one of those times and I spent my dream attempting to construct some sort of home made Pog set from construction paper, scissors, and string, and as usual my ""Assignment"" was very late and needed rushing along before some ominous due date. Now cue Picard, Troi, and I believe Crusher who sit in and chat, joke around and generally make my anxiety ridden task a little easier. As I said before I know the purpose of the dream is to release the anxiety of the day, but I have to admit it was fun that the Enterprise crew was there to help me along a bit if only in my dreams.

Its a stressful time for a lot of us, COVID19 has put me out of work and as I'm part of the supply chain for the hotel industry I am likely out for a long time if not for good. We prepared fortunately enough,  but we are defiantly up in the air like so many others right now. Fortunately our dreams are there to help us process our anxiety and stress. And for me fortunately I have my buddies from the enterprise to help me along too.

startrek,"They made a point of establishing that Seven knew Hugh, and cared enough about him to want to avenge his death. But we never saw them interact on screen. 

And it made perfect sense for them to know each other, btw; there aren't that many rescued Borg in the Federation and having experienced being a part of the collective is not something people can generally relate to or sympathise with, so that she would personally know one of the very few people who could comprehend a large part of her identity (and chances are when they first met, they'd have recognised each other anyway, since x-Borg don't forget their memories of being in the collective) is a perfectly reasonable thing to establish.

startrek,"As part of my quarantine Star Trek-mega binge, I finally got around to watching ENT. I remember being a teen way back in 2001 when the ads for the show came on TV, and I was totally turned off by the Vulcan Barbie sexualization (which I remember they pushed \*hard\*) and also that it was set in the distant past of the Star Trek universe. I just wasn't into that. I felt like Star Trek should always be going forward, into the future, not back into the past.

If I had known that so much of the show would be Vulcan politicking, Andorians, human supremacists, etc., I might have given it a chance. So far those arcs are definitely the best stuff on the show, and I enjoy the chance to see more of those cultures and their history. My boyfriend, who was watching the show with me, made a comment about how ""dour"" everyone was. I don't think the crew is actually dour, but they are generally pretty serious and straightforward -- none of them display any signs of having irascible, stubborn, hotheaded, or confrontational personalities. There's no Dr. McCoy, Miles O'Brien, Kira, or Seven of Nine on this show. Not even a Lon Suder. Trip kind of comes the closest, but he'd be the most neutral character on any other Star Trek show. I think that's why the episodes with Shran stand out -- he seems so firey in comparison with Archer.

I will say this, I teared up at the end of the episode when Trip and T'Pol's baby died. When we see T'Pol holding her mother's IDIC with grief in her eyes, and Trip approaches her talking about the funeral in his voice that just says he's devastated... that was some good acting and genuinely sad.",Finally watching ENT for the first time

It would have tied back to them apparently having some vague aspect of his memories already, and allow Data to save the day one final time from beyond the grave.",The ending I expected... (spoilers)
startrek,"Spoilers ahead! 

I absolutely LOVED everything about Picard with only a few issues. I really liked in Episode 1 we almost immediately got answers to some major questions. Mostly about the Romulan Sun going supernova, the attempted rescue operation of the Romulans, and the Synth attack on Mars. 

And as the show progresses, we still get little bits of information about things but nothing to in-depth. All of which is understandable so not to stray from the story line to far. 

That being said, I desperately want to know the overall status of so many more things! What’s up with the entire Borg collective? Obviously they are still out and about but are they significantly weaker after the blow Voyager gave to them. 

Also? What is the status of the Klingon Empire? They were weakened pretty significantly after the Dominion War, but what was their reaction to the Federation wanting to save the Romulan society? 

And on the note of the Dominion War, what’s the status of the Cardassians? Did Starfleet occupy them and help rebuild them so they could join the Federation? Is Bajor part of the Federation? Are ships allowed into the Gamma Quadrant? And what about the Dominion itself? Have they changed at all after Odo joined the Great Link? 


Again! I absolutely LOVED Picard and can not wait for Season 2 but So many questions hopefully get Answered!

startrek,"I have been watching TNG for the first time and just finished the season 5 episode, I Borg. 

I was completely shocked when Picard proposed a plan to completely destroy the borg. I understand that he is traumatized by them, but it just seems so out of character for him to order genocide. I am glad he changed his mind, but I am still disturbed by his plan anyway.

I can understand arguments that totally destroying the borg could be the right thing to do, I'm not totally convinced one way or the other myself honestly, but Picard doesn't seem like a person who could even consider it to me. By not following through with his plan I guess he has the blood of all of the borgs victims afterward on his hands, but that is different.",Was Picard out of character in I Borg?
startrek,"I keep seeing people criticise Picard in particular, but also often Discovery for being ""Dark &amp; Gritty"" but DS9 went waaay darker than either have ever done - in ""In the pale moonlight"", the Federation kills a foreign dignitary in order to trick another power into a war &amp; in ""For the Uniform"" a Sisko renders a planet uninhabitable. These are often considered both some of the best Trek ever made. There's an actual attempted coup on Earth. Sisko literally loses his entire station to the bad guys during a full blown invasion of the Federation in a war that killed Billions, with the crew of the station regularly checking lusts to see if thieir friends &amp; family are still alive. What have Discovery or Picard done that's gone approached anywhere near those levels of dispair &amp; darkness? And bonus question for people who gave up on either series during their first seasons - how on earth did you make it through season 1 of any other Trek?!",Have people forgotten how dark DS9 was?
startrek,"Now I love Star Trek, I grew up on it. But it’s time to discuss the absolute absurdity of the plot of Star Trek Picard.

First of all, the Zhat Vash are boring and absurd, and the whole synth thing was boring and absurd and didn't make any bit of sense for the Romulans (or for any race, but least of all the Romulans who have shown no hint of such proclivities before and are known in previous serious to be an intensely curious race with cybernetics researchers of their own). It’s nonsensical. At least the Tal Shiar make sense. They're an intelligence agency and they have their propoganda machine and silence dissent and ostensibly do some actual protection from outside threats now and again.

But the Zhat Vash are... a secret society of clumsy Keystone Cops dedicated to making sure nobody researches Synths. Because they found some message in the desert. And of course as a super discreet top-flight secret society they have 218 warships and millions of members and a limitless budget to dump into making sure nobody researches Synths. Right, that all makes complete sense for the Romulans. Not like they have anything better to do with these limitless resources, like oh I don’t know, rebuild the homeworld they were stranded on, I guess.

And don't get me started on the Romulan that was so sad when she was assimilated, that it shut the Borg down. Because she was sad. I fell out. 

PLUS the rest of the plot could be solved with a simple tricorder scan. You're telling me that all the times Soji went through a transporter buffer or was scanned entering or leaving secure locations in the Artifact that they never deduced she was not quite human? Similar thing with Commodore Oh - are there not a ton of full Betazoids in Starfleet? Could they not sense her treachery? Vulcans and Romulans are very readable to Betazoids. Also, as she was Starfleet’s HEAD OF SECURITY, why didn’t Riker drag Oh’s ass back to Starfleet to face treason charges? You’d think they wouldn’t let that go right away. 

I also disagree with the really dark tone of Starfleet in this series. It's like in the 20 years between Nemesis and Picard, the Federation somehow did a 180 and became cynical and distrustful like the Romulans. The tone doesn't work for this show, and it doesn't work for Discovery, either. They're trying too hard to make them bland, dismal sci-fi like everything else, and Star Trek has NEVER been about that.

End rant. Lol",Picard’s Plot (SPOILERS)
startrek,"Cause really. I mean don't get me wrong. Will Riker in charge and in a center seat was nice. Though a minor nitpick, I think Will should of been atleast a Rear Admiral commanding that taskforce. But minor nitpick. 

But really. All that taskforce felt like was the same ship copy and pasted 200 times. Just a lazy way out. I mean the design was nice, a different take on the Odyssey class in STO. But really no other designs?

I mean you're telling me there are now no other designs in commission in Starfleet anymore. Guess the battle of Procyon 5 is out the window for canon.

I mean I'll give DSC it's due. Battle of the Binary Stars was rather meh, but atleast there they took the time to have multiple Starship designs.

I mean a bit more of moving the goalpost(yes I realize this) but imagine the battle in Sacrifice of Angel's if the Federation Fleet was the Defiant, then a Miranda class ship copy and pasted 500 times and no other ships. Would of been dull, and most of us Trek fans would of been like ""Really? That's it?!"" Or I'd like to think so.

startrek,"Things I liked.

1: *The dinner table scene with Picard and Soji.*

It’s diamond. Between given dialogue and Stewart’s performance *specifically in this scene* - that was the first time I really saw Picard - he ate sparingly and gave considered, crisp, deeply human responses. I thought that guy could get up from that table and handle things, even at seventy odd. Stewart gave me a stronger sense of Picard in reserve in that single scene than I felt in 90% of the run.

2: The dynamic between him and his Romulan house staff, and the fifty seven weapons they had secreted around the house. That was a lovely kick off scene.

3: The opening dream scene. God that got me so excited.

4: **Riker**. The moment Frakes appeared was about the first point I believed this was real. 
Turns out he’s an outstanding natural actor and he brought it like a hammer. Ditto Sirtis, but Frakes landing felt like an anchor.

5: The final fireside scene with Data. 

--------------------

Things I didn't like:

1: Most of the rest of the series.

2: The weird sudden truncated digressions into crew (are they the crew?) people’s children/ other concerns. Here and gone again. Also the plastic handling of the new ship crew, the directed tenor of the performances (I’m super drunk for this call!), 
the total, total rejection of “if it doesn’t further the plot, confront or aid the protagonist why are you doing it” rule. 
It’s a real rule ffs. It's almost unfair what was done to the supporting actors. They were left swinging in the wind.

3: Chabon literally parked this series for long minutes at a time in every given episode for reasons I’ll never understand. To be clear I love Chabon as a writer. The Yiddish Policeman's Union I adore... **But what in the Christ**.  

5: Almost all that final conceit Picard manoeuvre and all after. Please let me forget that entire actor ego trip. It nearly wrecked the careful place Picard has in the mythos. He dies three times with eight close ups saving everyone and had to be literally dragged offstage. The invested parties need to have a conversation with Stewart. He needs to be Picard. He'll be happier.","Things I liked about Picard, and things I didn't like. Wow on either end."

startrek,"Seven was never an action-girl. She was an astrophysicist with advanced intelligence. We haven't seen her use that at all this season.

Seven was also never a hard-drinking hardass. She physiologically couldn't tolerate alcohol (or synthahol) and, by the end of the show, spent her spare time playing music and games, singing, and cooking. She put on a hard front partially due to social anxiety, but in her holodeck fantasies, she was warm and feminine. It's not that she wasn't tough, but that's far from all she was.

Now, it's understandable that what happened to Icheb would make her cynical and increase her 'edge'. But why was she out there 'on the frontier' in the first place? Why wasn't she at the Daystrom Institute or somewhere similar?

The suddenly bi thing also bothers me a bit. I am a bi woman, and I don't like the trope that the cool/hardass girl is bi, cos being bi is 'cool'. It would be more okay if she always had been, but Seven always liked men and never showed any signs of liking women. Except in fanfiction, of course, which was dominated by slash fic about her. I feel like pairing her with women suddenly is caving to the fetishization of her character and of bisexuality in general.

Idk; I feel like Seven went from an insecure (in some ways) intellectual to an action girl, and this change hasn't really been acknowledged or sufficiently explained. I'm hoping they'll be exploring her backstory more next season and we'll get to see more of what actually made her special.",Seven has always been my favourite Trek character.

startrek,"At first it felt promising, especially after Discovery, but the two are more alike than I think either of them would like to admit. I think the fundamental problem is; they spend so much time developing the plot that they leave no time to develop the characters. We’re supposed to care about Soji, but I feel like we barely know her.

Bring back the episodic format that makes Star Trek so iconic. This new format isn’t Star Trek, it’s just a drama set in the Star Trek universe with Star Trek themes dribbled throughout.

The beauty of the old format was that you got to know each of the characters slowly, over multiple episodes, where each episode developed a specific aspect of a single characters arc. It felt more immersive, like you were there and experiencing the journey with them, rather than just watching it unfold in front of you. The new format feels forced, laboured, and lacks any real energy.

Picard is in a duplicate synth body, does that mean that humans can now essentially live forever? Before your body expires just upload (or download?) your brain engrams into a new host.

Well I've always thought that bringing someone back to life once is cool but I really want to push the envelope and try to kill all the major characters at least six or seven times this season to really get that full effect. We've got elaborate yet pointless deaths written in for everyone but the resurrection is always going to be the same: Tuvix.



*What do you say to people who say there's discontinuity and illogical leaps in the series?*


You know, ever since Season 7 when Worf becomes a dancing tree, it's been my philosophy to completely ignore what happened in previous episodes and just write whatever sounds the craziest. Those leaps are called ""artistic license"" and I hope I don't sound too modest when I say that I am this generation's Leonardo da Vinci played by John Rhys Davies.




*When the Romulans have their battles with the flowers and the illusion fleet, what were you thinking as a writer?*



I know that people don't like danger and change. So I've tried to craft the show to avoid anything that might create real consequences or suspense. I think it's worked really well. No one gets hurt or stays dead. And no big ship battles. Those are dumb. Space flowers and fake ships all the way.



*What will you do next?*


Well first we need to give Raffi a jetpack and a gremlin sidekick. Then we're going to finally explore Jurati's obsession with murder. She's going to kill a lot of people but we'll forget about that for the finale in which she'll kill all the same people she murdered during the season all over again, cry, and then slaughter them once more. Then she marries Wesley Crusher. Again.


*What happens in the finale?*

Let's just say there are two synth worlds this time, two beacons, two cubes, and two of all the characters. 

I've invented a new race called Frog People and they're really going to take Star Trek in a new direction. Frog People discover they are characters in Star Trek and they escape and then sue the studio for using their likenesses. I think it will really hit home with a lot of people.

This is our chance to really explore what Star Trek is all about.




*What's that?*


Stuff coming out of portals.



*What happened to Commodore Oh?*



She got a jetpack and a gremlin sidekick. I don't want to spoil anything but they die. And that Gremlin curses A LOT.

The first half of the series was incredibly slow and then the second half felt incredibly rushed. Any time we got a tease of action it either fizzled out in seconds or was skipped entirely. (""We need to escape"" cuts to them having successfully escaped without any issue)

I enjoyed the fan service elements, Picard and the plot but found the series to be quite boring but my partner, who has only been getting into Trek with Discovery has been frustrated by every episode.

The show had lots of good elements butbad editing and lazy writing really let the show down.

Show us characters do things instead of skipping over the action. There was a massive imbalance between speeches and philosophy and action that TNG did a lot better.

Don't build up to an action scene only to not bother with it! It leaves the viewers really dissatisfied when they expect action that you have told them to expect only to not deliver.

DEVELOP CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS! Rios and Juratti flirted a little then all over a sudden they're together. Seven and Rafi interacted for all of 15 seconds but it ends with them holding hands all loved up. WTF I would have loved to see that relationship blossom. 

I'm hoping the show will grow its beard and get better in season 2 but this season has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I can cope with a slower show focused on plot and philosophical elements - Picard is known for his speeches after all.

The show just hasn't delivered for me. Apologies for the rant I've literally just finished watching the finale and I'm trying to process my thoughts",Did anyone else find Picard quite disappointing?
startrek,"I'm feeling a sense of gratitude for what *Star Trek: Picard* has brought back in regards to discussion and engagement with the *Trek* community. I've been watching *Trek* since I was a young kid. I grew up with *TNG/DS9/VOY*. When *VOY* ended and I went into college, *Trek* sort of faded into my past. I still loved it, but never got into *Enterprise*. JJ's first film was fun, but those films escaped me. *Discovery* is loved by some, but it's never resonated with me personally.

When *Picard* was announced, I suddenly found myself trying to track all the latest news and tidbits about the show before the premiere. The discussions and engagement online, be this sub or some engaging YouTube channels made for excellent *Trek* conversations and theories. The last 10 weeks have been a joy, and it's not something I thought I'd experience again like I did as a kid when my friends and I soaked up all things *Star Trek*. Yes, *Picard* has had its ups and downs, but I'm really grateful for the ride it has provided.",Thanks to Picard &amp; the Trek Community
startrek,"Long post ahead.

I sometimes am tempted to say that the criticisms levelled at Picard are just a vocal minority of old bitter people who wish that they still lived in the nineties. However that isn’t fair.

Beyond Star Trek, my other favourite show is Doctor Who. I’ve loved it since I was five years old. Then the latest era hit and it destroyed everything. To many I am the “vocal minority” in that fandom.
 Whenever I hear people say that, I feel that people are undercutting my own opinions. That my views aren’t as important because they are negative. That’s very Un Doctor who and VERY not Star Trek.

I love Picard and cannot see why people are SO critical towards it. It has flaws of course, but I genuinely feel that for the most part, people are just looking for something to hate. This Trek is modern, so for many people that equals bad.
 However, then I find myself considering how unfair that would be to others who disagree with me. How I would be invalidating others opinions, the same way mine has been in another fandom.

That being said there are some criticisms that just boggle my mind how idiotic they are that seem to come from wilfully ignoring the fact that  their criticisms have been explained away before, and the so-called “plot holes” have an actual logical reason. 

I’m unsure how to reconcile the two types of criticisms.

All I know is how I felt about the show.
Picard grew up with the people who watched TNG. It takes us exactly where we didn’t imagine we’d go, but somewhere it makes perfect sense to venture.
This series is the best first season any Trek show has ever done. It isn’t perfect, but comparing it to all the others, the only one that comes remotely close is the original series. 

I genuinely feel that when emotions calm down and people begin to get used to the idea, more and more will come around to the show. The same way they did in TNG. People forget that that show was pretty slated by the fans when it first came out, but was given the chance to endure and solidify into something better. 

Basically to me, Picard is genuinely one of the greatest seasons of Trek and I hope all involved don’t take too much negativity from the fandom. However, I also want to recognise the criticisms levelled at the show, even if I don’t agree with them.
To me, The show is a very well-written, well acted, well directed, and well scored one, that is a perfect addition to the Star Trek universe!",Pic: In Ten Years This Show Will Be A Classic
startrek,"So let me get this straight. There's a very tiny civilization on a planet that has the ability to open some sort of portal that would bring forth mechanical tentacles that would then ***destroy all biological life in the galaxy***. 

To make matters worse, this tiny civilization activated the beacon and the tentacle thing almost made it through, before one person changed their mind and closed it again, at the last second. 

Add to that, this very small civilization is made up of manufactured lifeforms, who with the threat of attack immediately decided to activate the beacon with very little debate. Which is like saying a bunch of robots needed hardly any convincing to try to ***destroy all life in the galaxy***. 

I totally see the Romulan's and Commander Oh's viewpoint here. I would in fact, have joined them. Not because I hate synthetics, but because the threat is too grave. And if I had to live with my conscience being burdened by the fact that I killed a bunch of robots, but ensured that ***all life in the galaxy*** would survive, I would bear that burden for my fellow galaxy inhabitants. 

So yes, I totally missed the point of Star Trek Picard. While he was arguing for synthetic rights and seeing the best in all life forms, no matter if they were manufactured or biological, I was yelling at the screen that he (and everyone else) is now taking a huge risk. 

What happens if the synthetics change their mind one day? What happens if just one synthetic changes their mind and activates the beacon? What happens if they do it behind the back of all the other honorable synthetics in the middle of the night or something? Starfleet, the Romulans, Klingons, etc. are all ok with this possibility?

I would have been the first person to fire on that planet, and probably slept soundly that night knowing I'm saving the galaxy.",I'm kinda with the Romulans on this one (PIC finale spoilers)
startrek,"Will  you people stop sh\*tting yourselves over Agnes?  She's no different from Vandermeer.  In fact, she has a far greater excuse for having killed.  Vandermeer was  a trained soldier who killed two innocent beings after merely being  ordered to do it, whereas she was a complete innocent who was compelled to kill one after being effectively tortured by an enemy agent.  Both attempted suicide afterwards, and one succeeded.

The only difference between them is that Agnes is a cute little blond who killed a middle-aged nerd.

Frankly, I'd love to see the parallels between her and Vandermeer drawn out more explicitly.  Developing a relationship between her and Rios more deeply based on the fact that she may have understood better than anyone else  on the ship what Vandermeer was feeling would be a great minor character arc in the second season.  It could be a great way to turn a creepy, dysfunctional hookup into an actual relationship and see what happens.  (This of course has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that I want to see Santiago Cabrera shirtless again, or that I like the idea of a skinny nerd landing him, honest.)

In a previous episode, Q taught Picard the importance of a near death experience to his life by allowing the captain to return to the past to prevent his best death experience and then letting him experience a future where he avoided the near death experience.

In the finale, he taught Picard the true meaning of exploration. I don't wish to spoil it to much, anymore than I already have.

startrek,"So something I haven't seen brought up much.

Picard died, and they copied his mind into the android body, yay he's back again!

Except, is he?

I mean from a storytelling perspective and all that, yes, Picard is back and ready for more adventures.  But from a more philosophical standpoint, they copied his memories, his personality, but Picard himself still died.

Makes you wonder about the last scene with Data.  Was the younger image of Picard there to see him on his way just a comforting figment of Data's final dream?  Or was that *actually Picard* there to guide his friend on to the next frontier?","Picard, that ending, and who is what?"
startrek,"Many of the Picard showheads and Stewart himself have said they don't want the show to be like TNG, and I get and respect that.

But I also feel like it cheapens TNG (7 seasons and 4 films) by not having all the original cast back at some point - together.  They were more than friends, they were ""family"" as Picard himself put it in Nemesis.

It feels like with season 1 of Picard that his family are split apart and don't talk at all. If something drove them apart, fans deserve to know.  I can't accept that they all just went their separate ways and they don't keep up with each other anymore.",I get that Stewart and Chabon don't want Picard to be TNG Part 2 but...
startrek,"*Prelude*  
So to begin, when I look back at my hopeful self saying Picard could be good its pretty clearly just nostalgia blindness. Thinking about it afterwards, there's no way to bring a new star trek series with old characters that wouldn't be at least jaring, with the differences in media today. I watched every episode as they came out and swifly went from 'It has potential' to 'When is something going to happen' to 'what is the point of this' to 'this is trash'.

*Conceptual Failings*  
Picard is a formula break. It shares none of the common thematic or tonal elements of the prior star trek works, as opposed to DS9 which subverted and recontextualised them. A darker trek can work, as DS9 shows, but only if it understands the underlying philosophy and can look at that from a different perspective, as opposed to something else entirely. Key example; all the prophecy nonsence. Its just a generic syfy programme with a veneer of star trek paint, taking elements from the Battlestar Galactica reboot and Mass Effect without the depth. The whole leave the romulans to thier fate thing is in stark oposition to the undiscovoured country; then core of the story has been told before and better. At that, the show seems padded. The first 3 episodes are on earth, and could easily be condensed into a single episode and there's an entire episode of fanservice. With a bit of editing, I honestly think it would work better as a film than a series. It seems that they had a core idea for the story but struggled to develop that, and just added side dishes.

*Character*  
Being presented as a character study of Picard, the main thing Picard needed to do well with was character. In TNG, Picard was a skilled diplomat and starfleet officer, a serious by-the-book sort of person, and a true believer in federation ideals. In Picard, he is only the latter. All depth regarding how he marries this idealism with his professionalism is gone. Another noteworthy mention is Seven. Its been two decades since we have seen this character, and when last we saw her she was on her way to being a reserved, but not unconfident, woman. I wouldn't expect no change; She'd probably go by Annika and be able to navigate social situations, if with a degree of discomfort. These changes were foreshadowed and coreographed in the latter seasons of Voyager. I cannot suspend by disbelief when Seven still goes by her Borg designation, has left her comfort zone, become a 'Ranger', began to drink and is now entirely confident around people, having abandoned the moral lessons imparted by Janeway. These two characters could have had some truly interesting interactions, but after draining Picard of all depth and dismissing Sevens arc in Voyager, they relegate this to one scene. Oh, and the new characters are similarly shallow and generally bad.  


*""""Lore""""*  
Star Trek lore is a big mess, hence the quotation marks. I think a bullet point list would be best;  
\- Why is the federation dominated by the Hawk lobby, when they were always presented as, at best, a sizeable minority in starfleet alone  
\- why is earth now terrible? what happened to paradise?   
\- Given that section 31 had the head of the Tal Shiar in its pocket, how did Oh slip under the radar?  
\- How did Oh, a romulan general, manage to hide her past in general  
\- The whole positronic neuron rubbish in general  
\- Rikers kids disease was dumb  
\- Are the androids entirely flesh and blood a la Fallout 4, or just fleshy shells a la terminator  
\- Why do the romulans have a secret society within thier secret police  
\- What is with all the swearing? Sisko commited war crimes and only went as far as damn  
\- What is with the vape 

*Wut I wunt*  
When can we get a truly episodic star trek series set post TNG to continue the story? Thats all I want; more star trek looking forwards. When is Kurtzman going to abandon the serialised model? I didn't work for Enterprise, its not working for discovery and I doubt it will work here. Give us episodes that focus on characters, allow them to develop. Star trek was always rooted in character, and the new trek tendancy to focus on one primary character (Burnham or Picard) hurts the shows badly. Not to mention, the attempt to vomit out a story shifts the focus away from any characters. Combining poor narative, poor character development, a central character, and a focus on the narative obviously doesn't work.

startrek,"Just got to the end of season 3. I'll try not to spoil anything in case anyone is doing the same as me in these trying times.

I've just done the last episode in season 3 where ""something"" happens to Picard and it ends on a cliff hanger and tonight I will be starting season 4. 

I can't believe how much I'm enjoying it and it seems to just be getting better and better. I really didn't think I would like it as much as I have and I find it nice that most episodes seem to have a beginning middle and end format but there is also a semi underlying plot.

It's very different to more modern series where it's all very involved and storylines take episodes or seasons to complete and I like the way Star Trek is doing it, it really makes for easy viewing.

startrek,"Hi everyone!

So... I REALLY like *some* aspects of the *Picard* series. In particular, I love how Romulan mythology is expressed by Narek to Raffi, Rios, and Elnor at the campfire.

I like how Narek reveals the extremism of Romulan culture because *Star Trek*, in particular *Deep Space Nine*, has always featured fictional cultures that are depicted as extremist ideologies.

It reminds me of Klingons with their pious worship of the most legendary warriors in their history. Also, Ferengi capitalism, and the Cardassian national-socialist-esque belief in cultural subjugation based upon a perceived ""natural"" superiority.

The secrecy and mystical wisdom that is sewn into the Romulan religion is particularly reminiscent of Bajoran prophecies, in that what they believe *might actually be true*. Nobody understands the wormhole aliens better than the Bajoran people, but that belief is encoded in a religious understanding of them as the 'Prophets'. To gain the Bajoran understanding of the wormhole aliens requires the ability to emotionally resonate with this religious understanding, as demonstrated by Sisko. Sisko's knowledge of the Prophets isn't incorrect, but at the same time it is not scientific. He's like a Prophet-whisperer, if you will, whispering into their ears to destroy fleets of Dominion ships, and making them do his washing and ironing.

Narek describes the foretelling of Armageddon with the knowledge and conviction of someone who has believed it completely since he was a child. His demonstration of piety stands in contrast to the newfound piety of the androids, who seemingly chance upon a similarly ancient deity-like ancestor of sorts, that immediately becomes god-like in their estimation.

Picard himself is an emissary of sorts as well... He's just a... Well, he's sort of the Western emissary. Or maybe he's a Western prophet? Picard *knows* that he is morally correct--and he is, philosophically speaking! According to the show, anyway. He struggles with individuals, but in terms of collective morality he's the king. It's not his fault he can't think about himself, he's the ideal collective thinker. He represents, according to the show, all of the best moral sides of a contemporary Western ideology. He doesn't strictly believe in welfare, but he believes in doing whatever it takes to ensure prosperity. He adores education and hard work, and abhors materialism and hedonism.

Anyway, a lot of it was complete rubbish, but I like how consistent it is with *Star Trek*, at least in that sense. I really liked the show.

startrek,"Is there a reason Oh didn't blow up the synths? They were going there to wipe them out prior to knowing anything about any beacon-portal. Why did she change her mind? We see they have a clear shot. Even if they didn't, surely they could have fought and *one* spaceship could get off a blast. Or at the very least try, given this was the Zhat Vash's entire purpose. 

As far as I can tell, she changed her mind because she felt threatened by Starfleet. But she's dedicated her entire life to this cause. She was willing to sacrifice billions of Romulans earlier. Why did she stop now? If it's for fear of intergalactic incident... well, surely she knew that was going to happen anyway, given that she revealed the head of Starfleet Intelligence was a Romulan plant.

startrek,"After all of the grand adventure why on earth did every single character death not serve the overarching story at all?

You could say Daj set everything into motion, but there was no need for her death. They could have gone on the same adventure with Daj and discovered Soji, pushing the whole synth story forward together. 

Echeb’s death was a disgrace to Star Trek. There was no point to it all than to motivate seven to kill a random gangster that I sure as hell did not care about at the end of the episode. And at the end of the season just for a “I never thought I’d do that again” line... seven was not put into a moment to question herself, she just Sparta kicked the psycho romulan to meet Palpatine at the bottom of the reactor pit!

And don’t even get me started on the apparent eyeball fetish the scriptwriters seem to have. Disgusting. 

And then there’s Hugh. And the whole damn Borg army while we are at it! His death carried zero weight to the rest of the story. There was nothing more than an “aww Hugh” and a boot at the end episode for all that!! Keeping him alive and actually servicing the Borg and XBs into the society on the android planet would have been a PHENOMINAL way to end their story. And the writers had to have known that with all the discussions, story threading, jams, and just straight up work they put into this. 

A character has to service a story otherwise it falls flat, and when a characters death fails to serve the progress story, that character was pointless. And I, just don’t like that. 
I think those characters deserved better.

startrek,"&gt;“If you look at any classic hero’s myth that is actually worth its salt, at the beginning of the hero’s journey, like with King Arthur, he pulls the sword from the stone and he’s ascendant — he has setbacks but he unites all the kingdoms. But then if you keep reading, when it deals with the hero’s life as they get into middle-age and beyond, it always starts to get into darker places. And there’s a reason for that: It’s because myths are not made to sell action figures; myths are made to reflect the most difficult transitions we go through in life.”

* Rian Johnson

It finally clicked with me in a unique way why I have enjoyed Picard so much.  Like many of you, I spent many nights in front of the TV as a kid, watching the crew of the Enterprise explore new life and new civilizations, and I was completely engrossed. Like probably some of you, I saw Captain Picard as a bit of a father figure.  He was authoritative, wise, commanding, but also gentle and kind.  I was all of ten years old when TNG went off the air.

Since then, I've lived a lot of life - you probably have too.  Some successes, and more than a few failures.  A marriage, and then a divorce I didn't want.  An unexpected career change.  Wounds, and healing.  I'm in my mid-30s now, and mostly at peace with where I'm at.  But when I watch Picard, I watch him struggle with grief, loss, regret, and guilt, so many of the same things I've experienced.  And that's what's unique about Picard as a series and Star Trek as a franchise - now it's not just a series I grew up with, it's a series that has grown up with me.

To be sure, there are criticisms to be made, and some things I wish they had done differently.  But the emotional core of Picard as a character rings true.  There are so few stories that really stick with you from childhood to adulthood - Lord of the Rings is the only other one I can think of at this time.  Star Wars is fine, but it speaks to my childhood.  Harry Potter is fine, but it really only appeals to my inner adolescence.  Even Wheel of Time, a series which I love to death, is mostly about escapism for me.  There are so few stories that have resonated with me and kept me hooked as a child and as an adult, and I'm so glad now that Star Trek is one of them.",Star Trek is the only series that has grown up with me.
startrek,"One of my favourite moments from the season finale was when Rios and Raffi are on the La Sirena trying to fix the engines. It's quiet, with just the sound of the air recyclers. A rare moment on this show without music. There's the technobabble about the fused intermix reactor between two crew members. There's the brainstorming and problem solving, collaboration between crew, and the successful fix. A moment we've seen played out countless times on TNG between characters like Data and Geordi in engineering, when the only soundtrack was the hum of the ships engine. I would have liked more of these moments this season. To me, these quiet moments are great opportunities for meaningful conversation between characters. Maybe there isn't a lot of room for these sorts of scenes thirty years on, but, I, for one, would have liked to see more of these moments.

Or at least selling them to the wealthy if the writes still want to avoid making the Federation an absolute post-scarcity utopia?

startrek,"This is a question that can be asked of pretty much any show now, but given the unique natures of Discovery and Picard, I think there is all the more reason to ask about them specifically.

First, what is the point of opening credits in the streaming age? Discovery and Picard are on CBS All Access only with the other shows on streaming platforms. Netflix allows you to just skip the intro all together, but CBS All Access won't let you, but you can fast forward. With shows exclusively streaming or being put on DVD, is there a need for opening credits anymore? What purpose do they serve in the streaming age when you can skip them? 

To me they are, at best, a waste of time, and, at worst, a spoiler within the show. Yeah I had no idea that Seven, Riker, or Data were going to show up in their respected episodes until I saw their names in the opening credits. Admittedly, this happened as far back as the TNG era, possibly TOS, but it was still a spoiler to put names upfront like that. 

Again I ask, why are they needed nowadays? Can we just skip opening credits all together and just save everyone's time and get right into the story?",Are opening credits still necessary?
startrek,"I'm thinking about how all the times Soji was talking about what it's like to question her reality and how her memories aren't her own, her life isn't her own, etc., it was the perfect set up for Picard to talk about his experience from *Inner Light*. Except instead, no, he just agrees that he can't possibly imagine what it's like.

And then talking about the consciousness transfer to a positronic body last episode I just couldn't help but think 'Haven't they already established this is possible in *The Schizoid Man*?', which then made it kind of obvious why they'd bring that up.

startrek,"As a lifelong Trekkie and huge TNG fan, I went into this show with very high expectations. Sadly, they did not reach them for me.

My biggest issue with the entire series, aside from countless continuity errors, is that it doesn’t respect the things that Trek stands for.

Since TOS, the message was that the future was bright, and that there were always a peaceful solution to any problem.
Picard follows the trend that Discovery set in it’s glorification of violence and overall dark tone. I’m not saying that there should never been any blood spilt, but killing seems to be most characters (even the good guy’s) first choice.
This is displayed greatly in the episode where Seven, despite Picard’s requests, kills a woman in cold blood, while basically saying “there’s no hope left in the galaxy.” That’s where the show really lost me. Jeri Ryan herself said in an interview that Star Trek stood out among other sci-fi series because of its optimistic view. Trek, throughout its many iterations, was always about hope and spreading good messages. I could not find any good message in this entire series.

Star Trek Picard, and Discovery as well, have become generic sci-fi thrillers instead a distinct Star Trek series. From the cursing, to the gore, to the disrespect for established canon, this “New Trek” has really lost me. It feels to me like the people that made the series never watched Star Trek, but instead just googled “Captain Picard” and wrote the show based off of that.

I don’t want to sound like an angry fanboy saying “f*ck you Alex Kurtzman”, but that was my honest reaction after watching this finale. If anyone thinks I’m missing the point, then I would love to hear your interpretation of this show and it’s message: I really would.

startrek,"I have long wanted to see a post-Nemesis series that touched upon the statuses of the Borg &amp; Dominion, Federation presence in the Delta Quadrant, the time-traveling division of the Federation, and the next big internal or external threat. Picard did not disappoint, but IMO too much time was wasted on a brief Zhat Vash backstory, and a Romulan with an English accent ""pumping"" an android for information. It didn't make sense that a fleet of ships would need to be built on Mars to evacuate Romulus. Wouldn't there be enough ships in Strarfleet and the Romulan Empire to do that? The Borg cube was underutilized. The androids were a brief threat. The half-Romulan half-Vulcan Romulan officer who was somehow a Starfleet commodore was a lackluster reveal. Maybe the sunglasses was a giveaway that she was a villian. 

I'd like to see a (mini?) series that covers a much longer time frame. Maybe one long episode set every ten years with a lot of overlapping characters so we see how they contribute to some ongoing arc plus technological development and progress of things that are best seen over an extended period of time, i.e. a Starfleet officer rising through the ranks or first contact with a newly warp-capable civilization that becomes a major player.",Idea for a series. Includes spoilers from Picard.
startrek,"In the world of Star Trek, fantastical new technologies exist, but humans are pretty much the same as they are now physiologically and spaceflight basically entails traversing the galaxy inside a vessel designed to recreate the experience of living in a town with apartments, a school, a clinic, etc.  


I understand this keeps everything relatable for story telling purposes, but it seems to go deeper than that in areas where The Federation's philosophy mirrored Roddenberry's own philosophy on issues like genetic engineering, transhumanism and so on. See: Eugenics wars, the stigma Bashir lives with as a GMO human, the fearful portrayal of cyborgs even though Geordi is technically one. Just slightly though. One toe into the future, but no further, because then it becomes scary and weird.   


As an example, in Star Trek we see that even ignoring Data, the Enterprise itself has a tremendously sophisticated AI. We also see replicators and transporters capable of assembling atoms in very large volumes, very quickly (as in that Trek movie where they transport a whale). This has some obvious implications. With AI, replicators, antimatter power storage and warp drive, there's no longer any reason for large, manned space vessels.  


You might instead send a much smaller, fully automated vessel to a habitable world where it replicates cities ready to be populated, and then creates humans from recorded templates to populate those cities. If the goal is to colonize the galaxy with humans, this is the simpler, safer way to go about it.   


Weaponized applications of transporter tech were very briefly explored in Voyager, and the canon explanation that they don't work through force fields explains why that tech isn't commonly used in battle, but the other applications of transporters and replicators are never fully explored because it would make a mockery of the way the Federation explores and colonizes space.   


Why, for example, do starships not self-repair during battle? Basing our estimations of the rate at which transporter / replicator tech can assemble particles on the whale transport scene, it should be completely feasible for a starship under attack to nearly instantly repair mild to moderate phaser burns, up to non-critical photon torpedo strikes. Yet all we ever see is the computer erecting force fields at hull breaches to keep the atmosphere inside the ship.  


We kinda sorta see transporter / replicator tech employed defensively in the futuristic starship Janeway brings from the future to deal a finishing blow to the borg, but there is no clear reason why it's used to fabricate additional armor when it could simply be used to repair damage to the existing hull faster than additional damage can be inflicted, and it's unclear why that tech didn't already exist even prior to TNG. As soon as transporters could handle large volumes quickly, all starships should've been able to self-repair in real time.   


Lastly there's the spooky movie monster depiction of transhumanism in the form of the Borg. As mentioned earlier Geordi is himself a cyborg but the visor and associated implants correct a medical problem rather than enhancing him. The canonical explanation for why cybernetic or genetic enhancement is verboten under the federation is a sort of cartoonish notion that enhanced individuals would go mad with power and try to conquer the world/galaxy.   


This, I feel, stems from fear of the future. Or more precisely fear of change. I think Roddenberry wanted to tell stories about humans in space. But if you carry the technologies in Trek to their logical conclusion, you get humans that aren't quite human anymore, which is less relatable and likely a frightening, uncomfortable prospect to viewers.",Why was Roddenberry so afraid of the future?
startrek,"So I just watched the last episode of Picard, and I can honestly say that it was my favourite Star Trek series ever.
It blended old Trek with new Trek and took the story to exactly where I wanted to go.

I often think that the best types of endings are the ones that you can’t see coming, but once it happens you can’t imagine anything else, and while I suspected certain things would happen, it all came together magnificently.
This is exactly what I wanted to see without even knowing it!

As someone who isn’t the greatest fan of Picard the character (early days anyway) this series blew me away by its take of the flawed but ultimately heroic man. It gave me such an insight to his character, that I felt I never really got before. Again he’s old but new.

The characters are absolutely phenomenal and while I know some people have issues with Raffi and wished that the villain had more screen time (I actually agree on that one), they all were so perfectly written and acted and felt like they truly belonged in that universe.

I know there is a lot of hate and criticism, and while I know this show isn’t perfect, (Neither was the first season of TNG), it is such a welcome addition to the universe. It’s not afraid of doing it’s own thing, yet it respects what came before. 

This show was absolutely phenomenal. I can’t wait for a rewatch!",Pic: That was the greatest season ever!
startrek,"Every time I watch Star Trek the Motion Picture, two scenes in particular used to absolutely freak me out when I was a wee lad. First one was the transporter malfunction, where viewers are treated to the agonizing screams of people getting their molecules disassembled. The second was the first “probe” Vger sends to the Enterprise...that stalking beam of light that blasted both ship and crew with lightning...caused many a nightmare...I can’t be the only one who was scared shitless by that thing...",Scariest moments as a child from The Motion Picture....
startrek,"JUST A HEADS UP: SPOILERS FOR THE PICARD FINALE

After having Picard, Data, and Riker all in the same episode of television for the first time in 26 years I was wondering if Picard would ever have a full-on reunion of the Next Generation cast.

Now, I know Stewart see's this as his ""Logan"" so the Enterprise crew will never be mains on the show. However, I think it would be great if they had a 5-10 minute scene where the Enterprise crew just all get together for a dinner, social event or something like that. I think it would be a really great way to pay tribute to TNG and all the actors without over-shadowing the main storyline the Picard writers want to go with.

I think everyone can agree that Picard is at it's best when it brings in past Star Trek characters. It's highest rated episodes on IMDB are Episode 7 (with Riker &amp; Troi) and Episode 1 (with Data). Seven &amp; Hugh are also some of the best received characters on the show (they should really find a way to bring Hugh back!). Plus, a lot of what makes Soji interesting is her connection to Data.

So yeah, I think it would be nice if the show gave us a scene with the entire TNG cast together again. Especially since Picard saying he doesn't want to endanger them (like he did with Worf and LaForge) isn't gonna work when he's already got Riker, Troi, and Data involved.",Do You Think We'll Ever Get A Full-On TNG Reunion scene in Picard?
startrek,"Picard has gotten a lot of praise and dont get me wrong, it is well deserved. There is a lot to love about it. But I personally just found it kind of..... disappointing.
One major issue I had with it was the cinematography. I often found that while watching the episodes, there was ALWAYS something moving. No shot was just allowed to sit, it was always panning over here, panning over there, someone moving so let's move the camera with them, ooh look they're holding something let's zoom in. It was very distracting. Other than that visually it was good though. 
Another problem I had was that the characters weren't really built on very well. They were barely even introduced, and I didnt feel like i got to know anyone. Their conversations also always seemed a bit stilted and weird.
Some decisions the characters and even the show itself makes are pretty dubious. There were a lot of things they did that didnt seem to make sense.

The final episode though fixed all of these issues. In it the cinematography was good, the characters had depth and talked like humans,  they made decisions that actually made sense and, gonna be honest here, there were a few moments when I properly fanboyed out a bit that made me grin from ear to ear. I adore the finale to this show, I just think it's a shame I wasnt able to love the rest of it",Star Trek Picard finale (no spoilers) was a fantastic conclusion to a kind of disappointing show
startrek,"I have a ocd and a few problems and I just wanna say this show brought out the absolute best in me. It forced me to start thinking more logically. My ocd makes me fear alot irrationally and I don't know what to say but it made me better. My ocd symptoms are gone down my fears are melted away. It's a shame stupid people like my popular sister give it such a bad rep like we don't even talk normally about it. Anyway I finished next the next generation in under two months, and I'm on ds9 now. Its actually really great I love it. People are so shallow 😂 thank God for this show",Can u just say thanks lol
startrek,"Now that Season 1 of Picard is complete, we can finally do this right.

If you only watch the **essentials**, it's nine episodes of Trek, and two films. (Roughly two hours longer than the first season of Picard.) The optional episodes add another 11.5 hours.

If I'm missing anything, let me know and I'll make edits.

But keep in mind: This isn't an attempt to list _everything_ relevant to Picard. But rather a good ""primer"" that covers a lot of ground efficiently, and invites Trek noobs to keep watching the classics if they're sufficiently hooked. Arguably, I've gone a bit heavy on Lore and Borg backstory (and Guinan), but I'm also trying to account for what else might happen in Season 2.

(Thanks to u/YankeeLiar in another thread for helping to compile this.)

**Essentials in bold.** The rest is good to watch for relevant history, flavor, and because you're trapped at home in pseudo-quarantine.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation** 

* Season 1, Episode 13: Datalore _(Introduces Lore, but ""Brothers"" gets more done)_
* **Season 2, Episode 9: Measure of a Man *(Data development, Maddox origin)***
* Season 2, Episode 16: Q Who *(Borg origin, but ""Best of Both Worlds"" gets more done)*
* **Season 3, Episode 16: The Offspring *(Data and progeny development)***
* **Season 3, Episode 26 and Season 4, Episode 1: The Best of Both Worlds Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Picard vs. the Borg)***
* Season 4, Episode 2: Family *(Deeper Picard psychology)*
* **Season 4, Episode 3: Brothers *(Efficiently establishes Data vs. Soong, and more Lore)***
* **Season 5, Episode 23: I, Borg *(Hugh and ""borg hacking"" conceptual origin)***
* Season 5, Episode 25: The Inner Light *(Very optional, but a brilliant example of Patrick Stewart being Picard from start to finish)*
* Season 5, Episode 26 and Season 6, Episode 1: Time's Arrow Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Data and Guinan)*
* **Season 6, Episode 14: Face of the Enemy *(Tal Shiar)***
* Season 6, Episode 26 and Season 7, Episode 1: Descent Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(More Data, Lore, Borg)*
* Season 7, Episodes 25 &amp; 26: All Good Things... Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Picard's mental state)*

**Star Trek: Voyager** 

Noobs should at least watch ""Scorpion"", and then keep going if they like Voyager.

* **Season 3, Episode 26 and Season 4, Episode 1: Scorpion Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Seven's introduction)***
* Season 4, Episode 2: The Gift *(More Seven separation)*
* Season 6, Episode 16: Collective *(Icheb's introduction)*
* Season 7, Episode 2: Imperfection *(Icheb and Seven backstory)*
* Season 7, Episode 25 and 26: Endgame Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Last time we saw Seven)*

**Movies** 

* **Star Trek: First Contact** *(The last, great Borg showdown)*
* **Star Trek: Nemesis** *(Romulans, and it's the last time we saw Picard and friends!)*

Edit: Formatting.",The definitive list of what to watch before watching Star Trek: Picard [probable spoilers in comments]
startrek,"Hey! So I’ll be honest I’ve never seen anything Star Trek, except a YouTube spoof series my old college friend showed me. I know one episode was about Spock badly painting a horse, but I can’t remember what the name of the channel or series was and I’m very interested! It’s very similar to DBZ abridged how TFS cut scenes from the show together to make the video. Also I after falling in love with The Orville I am really interested in Star Trek, and suggestions on where to begin? :) thanks in advance!",Not sure where else to ask
startrek,"I’m not sure if all would agree but the way data chose to die seemed a bit premature. I’m not sure but by the time of nemesis we don’t know how much and how long data was able to experience humanity with his emotion chip. So whatever Maddox put together to keep data alive doesn’t necessarily mean he was experiencing humanity. Am I missing something? 
Also with what they did with Picard. Would the Jean Luc Picard who chose to go about life with no regrets (emphasized in the episode “Tapestry”) choose to live on as a synth himself even tho he would have a finite lifespan? It’s gettin  philosophical but that’s what Star Trek is. No from each coming season I’ll find myself questioning if that’s really Picard or is that merely a copy/paste of the man known as Picard. I don’t know after watching TNG over and over gain since childhood I feel like picard would be against being transferred into the golem despite Data wanting him to live.
What do you fellow trekkies think?",Data and Picard
startrek,"1. Raffi 

She was right about the whole Romulan conspiracy. For years. And she never got a redemption moment, especially with her smug jerk of a son. She basically spends the last half of the show on the sideline. 


2. The Borg

Just there to look cool. The Cube could have held off the Romulan fleet, buying time while Soji reasons with the higher synths. Like the Phoenix, using a terrifying symbol of mass destruction for defense of a new race would have been a powerful, very Trek moment. But they just crash into the planet with a “lol. it didn’t matter.” It would have made Hugh’s death mean something if Seven had her hope restored and she and his rehabilitated xBs ending up be a key figure in the finale battle. Instead, they basically were window dressing. Take them out, and the story is the same. 


3. Dr. Soong 

Should have been Lore, honestly. But this is a personal opinion. Had he been Lore who upon being reactivated by Maddox, and learning of Data’s death, actually having a moment of character growth, realizing he’s all that’s left of his fathers legacy and helping Maddox continue his work in trying to make androids like Data. Then realizing getting the “evil” out of them was actually pretty difficult, and therefore he understood himself better and why everyone had such a hard time with him in the past... and then trying to redeem himself by reviving Data. 


4. Captain Rios

Inspired by Picard, he returns to Starfleet. I figured that’s what they were setting him up for. But then again, they’ve shown Starfleet doesn’t really exist anymore, unless you’re William T. Riker. 


5. Narek

Just got shuffled away at the end, and forgotten. What if he actually had a real turn at the end, since Redemption was alleged to have been what this was all supposed to be about. I really liked Picard’s housekeeper. She was fantastic, and made me realize it’s a tragedy that we’ve never had a “good guy” Romulan as part of the main cast of any Star Trek series before. Narek could have been a way to do that.",I feel like Picard had a lot of wasted potential.
startrek,"What are your predictions for season two of *Picard*?

Mine include;

* Guest appearance by Guinan.
* Guest appearance by the Doctor, who had been shut off during the Synth ban and will be reactivated following the events of the first season. A plot point will involve him adapting.
* Seven of Nine will be a reoccurring character.
* Elnor will be a reoccurring character.
* Other TNG characters, such as Geordi and Dr. Crusher, will reappear with a screen time similar to that of Riker.
* The characters learns the advanced synths hate humans because of that time Mike Nelson destroyed their planet.

i don't want this dark future (relatively) where the federation kinda sucks and the story is oh so very slow becasue you have to fill 10 episodes. i don't want any more shows that go into the past (ENT,discovery) and i definitely don't want any more TOS era movies (which to me are completely not star trek ,just my opinion).

startrek,"Hey guys,

The scene from the finale where the Borg face off against the Super Synth beings while the Romulans fight Starfleet was one of the best scenes in Trek history.

I thought when I saw the synth tentacles that the portal might close, but I knew the writers wouldn't set up that whole scene about the prophecy and not follow through.

At the end when our dear scientist girl was put on trial for the murder of Bruce Maddox, I was worried but when he reappeared in a new body he invented and forgave her, that was pretty touching.

Also, Picard's death really hit me hard. Maybe it was the fact I knew they wouldn't pull some corny stunt like instantly resurrect him.

And Elnor telling Seven she's hot was long overdue.",Things that really shined about Picard
startrek,"Some things are just obvious because they just are but I'd like to articulate it if possible. 

It seems obvious that Wesley Crusher is a Mary Sue and it seems obvious that Q isn't one. But Q is way smarter and way more powerful than Wesley Crusher. He's better than Wesley Crusher in every way except perhaps for his morality (that all depends on your interpretation of Q, how much of him you can take at face value and how much of it was part of ""the test."" Yeah, Tuvok's observation that Q has never been a liar is hilariously debunked) 

I guess some of you would object to labeling Wesley Crusher a Mary Sue or even to the existence of Mary Sue as a label. That's fine. That's not really the debate I want to have. I want to understand why Wesley is ***considered*** one by so many and Q never is.

I think perhaps its because Q is exactly what he's supposed to be. As an all powerful being, he never really does anything that's out of bounds for what he's supposed to be. You never say ""hey wait a minute, the author is deliberately pumping Q up to make him seem more awesome."" The writers actually use Q with a fair amount of restraint (probably owing to the incredibly limited budget). 

Whereas Wesley is kind of implausibly talented. He's supposed to be a human child yet he's already besting the entire starship crew. It would be one thing if this were just your run of the mill starship crew but this is the Enterprise, the flagship, so in theory these are the best of the best that Wesley is besting. And it only makes things worse when the writers decide that Wesley is basically the next step in human evolution or whatever the Traveler thinks he is.","How is Wesley Crusher a Mary Sue, but not Q?"

Their biggest plot-critical contributions (Soji talking to the Romulan aunt, teleporting Picard to Riker's world, getting rid of Narrek's fighter) had a million alternative solutions and some were only critical because they had gone to the Borg cube in the first place.

Despite being cybernetic they made no contribution to the synth storyline. Even 7 of 9, a Borg character, returned because of the Fenris Rangers rather than any Borg link.

startrek,"Modern trek is so afraid to be political, it just removes all the guts and substance from it all, and The Orville isn't about that, but For All Mankind might just be the Star Trek we all need right now in society, it's shot in a way that isn't generic sci-fi like discovery and not flat drama set like older treks, but in a way that's actually stylish in it's own way while still having that spirit of striving to be our better selves that trek always has had, it's of course in a totally different setting about something entirely different but it's the right spirit.

What do you guys think? Anyone here seen it?

Made a thread before and it got locked by mods with no explanation.

The purpose of this thread is to have a civil discussion about a show that is very clearly inspired and related to Star Trek, unlike Star Trek Picard, Discovery and J.J. Trek

It is available on Apple TV, but don't support Apple if you can and just pirate.  
The Orville is a Star Trek spoof show, it parodies the cliches of trek sometimes for laughs and sometimes for story, which it does well of course, both kinds of parody are valid like The Simpsons and Weird Al etc, but it's still just a parody.","""For All Mankind"" is the best modern Star Trek show."
startrek,"Didn't want a big spoiler on the title, but anyone else been pretty disappointed by the Borg moments being anti-climatic.

First we get Queen Seven for like 30 seconds and then BOOM, done. All drones in space. Romulans just leave.

Second we get Borg Cube appears...and flowers destroy it in 5 seconds.  

I mean, Seven and her Borg squad better do something impressive other than failing in the last episode soon. If we're luck, maybe we'll get a Sphere from the wreckage.

startrek,"Why would the enlightened 24th century have such an outmoded and culturally loaded/biased prudish view on swearing from hundreds of years prior? Uhura once said something to the effect of 'it's only a word, it has no power to hurt me' when someone from the past called her a 'negress'. Here is PIC exec producer Michael Chabon's view on this, which I agree with:

&gt;No human society will every be perfect, because no human will ever be perfect. The most we can do—and as Star Trek ever reminds us, must do—is aspire to perfection, and work to make it so. Until that impossible day, shit is going to continue to happen. And when it does, humans are going to want to swear. The absence of swear words in Star Trek was never a matter of Federation principle, it was a matter of FCC rules. Writers of previous eras had no choice. They were censored. Swearing is one of humanity’s most ancient, sensible, and reliable consolations. Personally I would consider any society that discouraged, banned, or abandoned the use of curse words to be a fucking dystopia.",On the swearing in PIC..
startrek,"So let me get this straight, if there was a developing civilization of innocent and even peaceful people being overrun by edgy warmongers of their same species... the federal would let those lives be brutally killed off and have the planet become a space faring war race once they reached warp drive tech?
Like, I wouldn't even be suprised if just about every race the federal had a problem with, like the Klingons and Cardassians had this same altercation with their own kin from long ago, and, the bad won and now they have these war races that caused so much terror. In fact; we even see this with the Vulcons and Romulans, only, the species as a whole was too far in for one side to be destroyed so they had the chance to agree to disagree and split.

startrek,"To me this is evidence of a strange character flaw of Captain Picard. There was more than a few instances of Data essentially losing control, being influenced by malevolent forces, or malfunctioning to the point of endangering the ship and crew. Christ, he almost stabbed Troi to death.

But if I were a crew member on theEnterprise serving with Data I’d be scared shitless, just waiting for the next time he went crazy, and tried to blow up the ship or kill one of his crew mates.","In Star Trek: Picard, Jean-Luc states that he never once lost faith in Data."

The acting is great (more on this below), but I mean it's taking a whole episode to move the plot forward 2 inches, then we side quest for an episode, gain nothing, and get back to the main plot. This entire concept could have been wrapped up in one episode of VOY/TNG/DS9. The lengthy irrelevant conversations between the supporting characters, the (i hope not intentionally) bad editing jarring from scene to scene. This movie looks like a Serenity remix, very little actual Federation/Star Trek universe involved. I mean how fucking much of a back story do we need from the fuckin lizard dude? 

I love ST, and I'm gonna finish the series, but I'm just thinking this isn't for me.

Is it to distinguish her from Locutus of Borg? Or was it just something the producers just made up? I'm all for the blue laser eye, it was kind of cool really and on first viewing when I was a child, after Voyager's initial run as on first airing I was 4.

The episodes are two of my favourite episodes in Star Trek and probably my second favourite Borg story behind BOBW, it had Susanna Thompson in it for crying out loud, one of the best Star Trek actors to play multiple series behind Combs and the other greats.

- RIP Benjamin Sisko. May you rest wherever you are.
- I love how Odo softened himself up to go into the Great Link wearing a tuxedo for Kira Nerys. If you're going to go out, go out in *style*.

- I guarantee you that Julian Bashir and Miles O'Brien went to the real Alamo at some point.
- Rest in Flames, Gul Dukat and Winn Adami. You two deserved to burn.
- Do you think Jake Sisko inherited the Bajoran land Benjamin Sisko bought and built that house on it? It'd be cool if he did.
- It's interesting that, of all three prominent Cardassians- Gul Dukat, Legate Damar, and Elim Garak- only Garak survives. The old Cardassia is gone- and only the prodigal son (Garak) is left to rebuild it.",I Just Finished Deep Space Nine...

startrek,"Only four years (and some change) away from the events in DS9 Past Tense.

Say what you will about DS9, Bashir, and Time Travel.  What is pertinent is the looming recession that results in wide unemployment and homelessness.  I have already witnessed the response locally over the last few years to the homeless population of hiding it under the rug by moving (through force or policy) homeless away from where they are easily seen.

Past Tense is one of the Star Trek episodes that I have always been impressed with its ability to accurately describe the human condition.  Now with a global pandemic and recession it is striking really hard and close to home.

startrek,"I've seen all of TOS, DS9, TNG, and up until season 6 of Voyager. Yesterday, I all of a sudden remembered an episode that I loved, but have forgotten the title and what series it's from. For the life of me, I can't find it. 

It was an episode in which a few of the characters were stuck on a planet. They were inundated into fighting for a supposed group of refugees, including a young girl (who liked flowers, I recall) and her elderly grandfather. The main characters originally didn't want to get involved in the fight, but perceived the destruction by the empire as so devastating that they began to become soldiers fighting for the protection of the refugees. It turns out that it was all some training simulation for people to get brainwashed into being soldiers. 

I might have some of the details wrong, but does anyone have any idea of what episode I'm talking about? I desperately want to rewatch it. Thanks!",Help me find a Star Trek episode?
startrek,"I watched TNG when I was a kid, went on to DS9 and Voyager, Enterprise (surprisingly watchable), loved all the movies and have felt strangely detached from Discovery. 

Although Picard is a slow burn compared to the older stuff, I found myself thoroughly entertained despite several minor-to-medium sized oddities. It's not perfect but miles ahead of Discovery imo. A solid 8 out of 10 in my book, and yes, I know I'm in the minority here.

Anyway, I'll be the first to admit there are things I don't particularly liked:

1. Misscast of Jurati. Both the acting and writing is poor here. There's no emotional investment in her. Toss her out the airlock for all I care.
2. Budget Antonio Banderas. Was there some sort of competition with The Mandalorian for putting troubled yet sexy latino men into the mix? Anyway, Rios has grown on me, so hey,,
3. The actress playing Raffi is quite hammy at times. 
4. The shoehorning in of as many former ST characters as possible. Cheap trick for sure. Some have worked well, others much less so. 
5. Although I do find the overall plot sufficient for a series, I can't help thinking the writers got a bit too inspired by the Terminator series and, come on, haven't we gone through plenty of Real or not Real themes, especially with Data over the years?
6. The state of the Federation. Basically we know nothing except for them having banned synthetics. This sets them up almost as the bad guys. Don't know if it's poor or weasly writing, but I doubt Gene R would have approved.",I actually really enjoyed binge watching Picard.
startrek,"Don’t know if anyone has made this connection, 

Could the message/warning from the AI species, be in fact the from the machine world that V’ger encountered? 

After its encounter with Kirk and the crew and perhaps it returned there after vanishing. 

Due to the info obtained, interactions with organic beings, perhaps this led the machine beings to send the warning into the past based on V’ger’s interactions with Kirk, klingons ect.  Giving them all they needed to know (about organics) and the last chance for organics to prove themselves to the machine world, would have to be V’Gers own interactions with ‘The Creator’. Maybe Kirk et all didn’t do much to impress them after all.

startrek,"It's weird, right? Most shows from the 90s or 00s don't hold up well to 2010s or 2020 sensibilities, they are either too needlessly hammy, melodramatic or edgy. But I can show most old AF TNG episodes to regular, non-nerds and they would enjoy it (emphasis on ***most***). However, the movies just haven't aged well at all. They just stink of the era they came out on. 

 Even First Contact can't escape this. It has what I can only describe as a Nu Metal aesthetic, you know? First Contact and Nemesis, in particular, are shot like Music videos, while Generations and Insurrection are shot like TV movies. Not sure which is worse.

Why do you think that is? Was there a shakeup behind the scenes between the production of the TV shows and the movies? As far as I know, it was all Berman but they seem to be made by completely different people (barring the cast, of course). 

Mind you, I have 0 nostalgia for TNG, I caught up on Star Trek as an adult, way after college. Haven't even been that into sci fi until like 5 years ago, always been more of a crime fiction nerd.","Having rewatched TNG recently, it's amazing how well it hold up compared to the Movies"
startrek,"So I had never seen TAS until recently, when my dad got me to start by watching this episode. TAS was the Star Trek of his youth, so I figured I'd give this episode a shot. I know that TAS isn't very popular with Trek fans overall but this episode has actually aged like a fine wine, in my opinion. There's lots of little moments and themes in it that work extraordinarily well with all the Treks that have come out since then. 

There's a moment where Spock and the Andorian first officer who replaced him in an alternate timeline have a little moment of respect between them despite their differences, which if you're looking at this show as being post-Enterprise is so Star Trek it's almost painful. Just the fact that this Andorian officer is totally willing to hear Spock out and actually supportive of restoring the timeline so Spock has *his job* is exactly the kind of Trek I love, once described to me as ""competence porn."" Rational and emotionally mature people doing stuff not because they'll personally benefit, but because it is the right thing to do.

Spock's troubled childhood is a defining characteristic of him throughout the various series, and I think the way Discovery goes about it by saying that he actually had some sort of learning disability makes *Yesteryear* work even better. The way he is more or less bullied by the other Vulcans for not being the same as them makes me see why he resonates so much with audience members who might have similar differences.

Like I said before, *Yesteryear* is like, definition of a great Star Trek episode. It even has a moral dilemma at the end that, if you take it to one of its logical conclusions, is actually pretty controversial today (letting something or someone die with dignity rather than pointlessly prolonging a painful and unfulfilling life).

Anyway, I just thought I'd share this on here and maybe get some people to take a look at TAS. I've seen a few other episodes which all vary in quality, but *Yesteryear* to me definitely stands the test of time.",I'm in love with the TAS episode Yesteryear

We know Brent Spiner doesn’t have interest in playing data any longer because of his age so this could be a great way to connect Old trek and new trek through a recasted data. I don’t think this will be a real sacrifice as we know Picard will have a season 2.

When you began, all those years ago. Hopeless that Trek would never return, only to get a new movies to hate..i was disconcerted

When you finally got a new series, actually set in the prime timeline. Only to write it off as hot trash because writers couldn't get away from prequels with bald Klingons and holograms, I worried.

Soong type androids with human skin covering their robotic body. Indistinguishable from human beings at first glance, but actual machines underneath.

startrek,"So I'm going through Enterprise again, and came to the episode ""Rogue Planet."" (S.1E.17). On this rogue planet is a race of shapeshifters, hunted by a bunch of aliens. 

When we first come to Odo's home planet in DS9, it's a rogue planet, and the shapeshifters there were hunted by solids for hundreds of years. 

What if the rogue planet in Enterprise *is* the home planet of the Changelings, and has been drifting across the galaxy? In 300 years, it wouldn't be a far stretch for it to have drifted to the Gamma Quadrant. It would explain further the Changelings' fears of solids. 

The only thing wrong with this would be that the shapeshifters in Enterprise are these slug-like creatures. But, what if, over time, they evolved into the Great Link and a completely liquid state. And the Founders forgot that it was a human who gave them the ability to truly hide themselves from their hunters.

I did enjoy seeing some spine from Chakotay when he stood up for B'elanna.

I'd forgotten that the Vidiaans were in it so early.

The micro-wormhole episode seemed a tad funny. I actually liked the episode, but where was the suspense? Obviously they were not going to get home! Still, a nice twist of the dagger at the end.

startrek,"I’ve been thinking about the way the various series aged and how they compared to each other. We tend to seek-out patterns but I doubt that can ever really tell ya the whole story. I’m focusing on pre-Discovery series for now since I’ve noticed discussing Picard brings out the worst in people. I'm curious what thoughts or insights any of you have on this.

The Original Series: The general consensus is that first season was the best, and I would put season 2 on a comparable level. The decline in quality has generally been attributed to the slashed budget and the fact that Gene was no longer working on the show. 

The Next Generation: I've always thought seasons 3-5 were the best, and I've only met one person who thinks season 1 is the best. While TNG still offered a trickle of great episodes right up the end, seasons 6 and 7 seemed to be running low on ideas and resorted to introducing family members (both logical ones like Geordi's mother and left-field ones like Troi's sister and Worf's brother, Nikolai) and to Brannon Braga weirdness like ""Masks"", ""Genesis"", and ""Emergence"". Could TNG actually have been running out of possibilities or was there a malaise and lack of artistic courage on the part of the writers? 

Deep Space Nine: I think DS9 found it's footing early and allowed change to be a theme in a medium where the rule is generally to regress to the mean. However the series could easily have been wrapped-up in a few episodes at the end of season 6 and in many ways Season 7 felt like an artificial extension. While we did get some great moments in season 7 (""Badda Bing Badda Bang, Ezri Dax, and the finale arc, to name a few) it did feel like a less natural sequence of events compared to seasons 5 and 6. 

Voyager: I think Voyager generally had a problem committing to it's own premise. IT should have featured more planet-of-the-week storylines and fewer visits from old Trek than any other series, but instead we got recurring Q, Borg, Cardassian, and even Boothby. That being said, I think season 3 was when they series began to commit to looking back less often and taking risks with characters, and while I don't think Voyager was eve as good as earlier series, it didn't get much worse over the years and ended on a relative high note.

Enterprise: A weird outlier, Enterprise didn't approach good until season 4, when at least the writers were using the established cannon to build their stories from rather than trying to subvert the audience's expectations. Was this fanservice? Sometimes. But in a way, any Star Trek series is going to be fan service by it's nature. If you're writing a prequel series, the purpose is supposedly to feature elements from the universe's past and frankly any writer would be foolish not to want to draw upon the enormous universe that's been created, whether the audience is aware of it all or not. The fact is there's something to work with. So while I don't think anyone on the creative team had their heads in the right place from the start, at least they were able to understand the response and course-correct to some degree. 

You're thoughts?",Quality of each series over time.
startrek,"Here’s some (slightly abbreviated) opinions of mine on the TNG movies...

#Generations

Eh, it’s alright. I think plenty of things were wasted here like Kirk, Data’s emotions and Picard’s family being killed and the lighting is awful the whole way through (why does it look like the afternoon on an evenly lit spaceship?) but the action is good enough, I like the villain and it’s paced well enough.

#First Contact

I LOVE IT. I love the Borg in the movie, all the acting is very good, the action is intense and fun, it looks absolutely amazing the whole way through, and it keeps the excellent pacing from *Generations.* It’s my favourite Star Trek movie and one of my favourite movies of all time.

#Insurrection

It’s a decent movie. It feels like a TNG two parter with a much bigger budget, which you can take as you will. Nothing about the movie stands out as particularly awful or excellent, and it’s the slowest since *The Motion Picture* but I don’t mind it.

#Nemesis

I don’t hate it, purely because I like all the Trek movies, but I definitely would say this is the worst by a huge margin. The visuals are pretty decent, I like seeing the Romulans cooperating with the Federation and it’s not as slow as Insurrection but that’s it. The acting isn’t great, the plot is piss poor and the villain is the biggest waste of potential I’ve seen in the franchise. I can stand it, but I’d say this is the only really bad movie in the franchise.

#Final Rankings:

*First Contact* by a margin the size of the Alpha Quadrant.

*Insurrection*

*Generations* in a somewhat close third.

*Nemesis* in dead last.

Which is kinda weird if they comment how “woke and sjw progressive trash” are the current Star Trek shows. 

And it’s not surprising to me on why some “Fans” gets easy trolled by everyone...",Blinded by “Nostalgia” and never see the true political meaning (on Star Trek “Fans”).
startrek,"I like this movie. I think as far as Star Trek movies go, it's pretty good. I was 14 when it came out, and it's very nostalgic. Almost as much as the show is. Is it's plot airtight? No. Is there a lot of stuff in there that doesn't make sense? Sure. But more than any other Trek movie? No not really. 

The action seems good though. The stakes seem very appropriate. Unlike Insurrection. The production value seemed pretty high, higher than First Contact I would say. The uniform mixing and matching annoyed me but I don't think regular folk would notice. 

I wasn't thrilled that they destroyed the Enterprise D but they needed a new model so that was going to happen no matter what. 

I also don't like how they killed Picard's family. It seemed rather pointless. 

I think it was kind of a waste giving Data his emotion chip in a movie, where there not really going to have any time to meaningfully explore it. 

But still, overall, I find this a very entertaining Trek movie. Probably my favorite of the bunch. First Contact is ok but they changed the borg so much, and pretty much just turned it into a big old action movie staring John Luck Pickard as john McClane.

startrek,"Finishing getting caught up with Picard this evening, I was just curious if anyone else finds the design of these 25th century Romulan warbirds as irksome as I do. To me they look more appropriate as something Boeing would come up with as opposed to a ship of the line of the Free State. Romulan ships have always had such a presence about them - the D'deridex being many's favorite vessel design in all of trek. Even accepting that their nation has new priorities, and is perhaps is forced to streamline their designs due to resource constraints, I'd hoped for something much closer to a spiritual successor to the juggernaut that was their previous models. Personally, the ship referred to as Kerchan class is more along the line of what I'd picture that to be. /quarantineshitpost",[Pic] Bone to pick about ship aesthetics.
startrek,"Hey friends. I'm a big fan of US college basketball and with the tournament cancelled, a number of other versions of March Madness have emerged and I was thinking about potential Star Trek editions of March Madness. My original thought was to have a 64 episode tournament, but selecting my top 64 episodes of Star Trek is turning out to be a bit ambitious, let alone ranking them (maybe next year). 

I thought a more manageable March Madness style tournament would be to have a movie mini-tournament. I have ranked all 13 movies (debate those if you wish) and arranged them in a bracket. Top three movies get a bye into the second round. It would be swell if you folks could vote for your favourite movie in each matchup and the movie with the most votes will advance. I'll trust everyone here to go on the honor system and only vote once. I'll tally up the votes at the end of the week. Let's begin with the rankings:

(1) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan 

(2) Star Trek: First Contact 

(3) Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home 

(4) Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country 

(5) Star Trek III: The Search For Spock

startrek,"It's pretty common on here to see posts telling new ST fans to avoid seasons 1 and 2 of TNG, and in fairness, there are lots of sub-par episodes. However, I think that there are still some really great episodes. 

Specifically, I think that ""Skin of Evil"" from Season 1 is not just good for TNG, but one of the best episodes of Star Trek. It's also very topical. The eponymous ""Skin of Evil"" in the episode sounds a lot like modern incel and ""nice guys"" who are overflowing with hate and anger because of how they perceive their own treatment at the hands of others. The episode also breaks the viewer's assumptions - I have to expect that just about everyone who originally saw it thought that Tasha would be miraculously saved at the end. And the very last conversation, between Data and Picard, continues to be poignant to me:

&amp;#x200B;

Data: ""I keep thinking - how empty it will be without her presence. Did I miss the point?""

Picard: ""No you didn't Data, you got it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my point is that for all of you new ST fans, do yourself a favor and watch all of the episodes. There are great bits everywhere.",Not all S01 episodes of TNG are bad
startrek,"I grew up watching tng, very familiar with those.  I have the dvds and have watched entire series a few times. I watched ds9 through once. Loved it but don't remember it super well. Watched maybe half of Voyager, plus a few random episodes. Watched about a season of enterprise, never watched discovery. 

Do i need to be familiar with events from any of those beyond tng? Would it make sense to jump right in with Picard or should i watch other things first? 

Sorry if this is answered elsewhere. I've avoided most posts from this sub lately because i figure I'll watch Picard eventually and want to avoid spoilers as much as possible",How much background do i need to watch and enjoy Picard?
startrek,"After being bullied by my wife into watching The Next Generation I started my journey about a week ago. Boy, I've been missing out.

We've been watching Discovery and I've seen the older movies when they've been on TV but I was never really interested in watching any of the older shows after getting through maybe two episodes of TNG Series One and deciding that I would rather gouge my eyes out with a spoon. But she persuaded me to get through the first couple of seasons and I'm glad I did because I've judst finished the episode where Q plays trumpet in a mariachi band. 10/10 Best Show Ever.

Some points for new watchers though;

1) Ignore the first couple of seasons. I can't think of anything that happened that made me feel that they're essential watching.
2) The complete shift in quality from Season 2 to 3 is HUGE. From story quality to cinematography and special effects it's like night and day. The only constant seems to be that the quality of acting is as good as it was in the early episodes, which is impressive since in those early days you could feel some of the cast wanting to scream at the dialogue they were being made to say.
3) Riker's nickname should be ""Shagger"" because he's a total lad.

That is all.",So I had never watched The Next Generation until last week...
startrek,"So, I recently decided to jump into the trek universe. I've seen all TOS, and making my way through TNG, VOY, DS9, and ENT (I'm waiting to start Picard after I finish TNG). I also started Discovery...and I'm having trouble with it. The serialization doesn't bother me, I honestly prefer an overarching story to episodic stories, but I don't begrudge anyone their preferences. I've also seen a lot of complaints about the grittiness of it, but I think people view the older shows with rose colored glasses. There was all sorts of violence and death throughout TOS (that horrifying teleporter accident in TMP) and TNG (head exploding and chest bursting). I think the content of the older shows was really just a product of the standards of their times. 

The thing I have the biggest issue with Discovery so far, is the terrible writing and unlikable characters. I'm about halfway through season 1 and it feels like a chore. While I kind of enjoy the morally grey Capt. Lorca, I find Saru is kind of just a dickwad, and Tilly is more cringy than funny. But the absolute worst is Michael. She's just so incredibly unlikable I can't bring myself to care about her at all. And so far there's this pattern that basically goes:

Captain: We have to do the thing!
Michael: No don't do the thing, it's bad! 

And then no one listens, resulting in her mutineering, or just breaking rules in general just so she can be proven right in the end, like she's some anointed savior of the galaxy and everyone is always wrong but her.

I know it's not unusual for shows to have rocky starts, but I do have to ask, does it get better? I've heard that Spock and Pike show up eventually, which I would be interested in seeing, but so far it's just a chore.

Also, why do they have to keep fucking with the Klingons? I don't think I've ever seen a race evolve so drastically over the course of what's supposed to be something like, less than 200 years? I honestly hate the new Klingon design.",A Trek Noobs Impression of Discovery
startrek,"Look, *Star Trek: Picard*.  I've been rooting for you.  I've been defending you to my fellow nerds and trying to see you for the beauty that you could be, just given a little time.  The idea of making a show about a character like Picard that does nothing but criticize the character of Picard is... ballsy.  And you've certainly stuck to that premise. But I have some concerns. 

When you had an admiral drop an f bomb to Picard's face in the heart of paradise right out of the gate, I was... disconcerted.  

When you started to portray Picard as Don Quixote, I went with it.  Sure, ok.  Not what I wanted but I'm along for the ride. 

When you ripped out Icheb's eyeball I was grossed out.   

When you had Picard turn his back on a person he supposedly loved so she could go live in a space trailer and get high, I worried.  

When you introduced a one-dimensional femme fatale incestuous evil chick as the primary antagonist, I was concerned.  

When you killed Hugh for no reason, I struggled but accepted it.  

When the Troi-Riker boy could have been saved by having a virus gestate in a positronic matrix ^(how does this even make sense) I started to smell bullshit. But they went to a planet with regenerative properties, hoping it would help.  Ok. 

When Soji, a being with wholly constructed memories, had a memory of her super secret homeworld that was brought forth with the zany Romulan walking through the room ritual, I sighed but said ok.  (Like why would Maddox give her a memory of that if he was trying to keep it secret?)

When the Federation turned synths into slave labor despite everything that the Doctor and Data accomplished, I thought ""hmm.  that's inconsistent with core Federation values.""

Then a gold skinned synth showed up *and learned how to mind meld*. Is there a tutorial?  Can I take it?

When you turned the synth colony into the bad guys, I knew, just knew, that you guys really had no fucking clue what you were doing from the start. Not story-wise, but artistically. and conceptually.  Is this Mass Effect 3?

And then there's super synths hanging out in subspace somewhere that, despite being super superior, can only protect other synths by wiping out all organic life **and that's the only option**.  Oh. My. Fucking. God. 

And ultimately there's been no leg work to make the synths on the Synth World seem like folks worth saving.  I almost agree with the Shat Vag or whatever they're called.  The scary ass synths on Mars were automatons (""Good morning, plastic people"") that murdered a bunch of folks.  And apparently the ones on the Synth world are totally down with killing all other life *in the fucking galaxy* so they can keep going on their planet with a population of... what, 50?   100?  Aren't these folks supposed to be good at math?  

I can't do this anymore.  I know you're going to have a big battle with lots of spolsions and pewspews and music next week, I'm sure it will be pretty.  I'll watch, because I suspect you'll have Picard become Locutus again to control a bunch of borg cubes or some shit and that sounds super cool.  But the magic is gone.   It's just spectacle now.  You're not relationship material, but I'll answer your booty calls.  If I'm free. How about you just text me instead.

-Scenes between B’Elanna and Neelix are pretty great too. Another character that brings out B’Elanna’s softer side. Some of the few cases that I can actually tolerate Neelix.

Kinda disappointed me.",Voyager interactions
startrek,"We are nearing the season finale, and I’m still confused by the whole Romulan situation, but here are the three main points. 

1.The J.J Nova

2.the rescue 

3.the empire


1. This is something I believe should have been left alone. In 2009, it seems that to supernova was near instant, but in a different star system(like hobus in STO). This, while still annoying, makes sense. There was no warning, which probably means foul play like the weapon in generations, and it still allowed time for Spock to get in his super fast plot dev- I mean ship and take his Maggif- I mean red matter and create a black hole. However, Picard messes this all up by having a two year period between the STOP of the evacuation and the supernova happening. And, it seems to be changed to the Romulan home system. This doesn’t make sense for two reasons.

A. It seems to be a natural event. Every weapon we have seen used on stars that create supernovas are instant. The weapon in Generations, the weapon in STO, other sci fi weapons all cause supernovas instantly. However in Picard it seems natural. The problem here is that the Romulans are nomads, they settled there about 1,800 years ago. If it was natural then the Romulans would not have settled there, or at least not for long.

B.There would be notable climate differences, such as droughts(see the inter light). However, in Reunification(about 31 years prior) we see that the climate is normal and in Nemisis the Star is a normal yellow dwarf. 

If it wasn’t natural, why was a there a 2 year period between the end of the evacuation and the supernova. If it was a Star like hobus, why didn’t the Vulcan science academy just use the red matter on it, since it most likely wasn’t inhabited. And if it was the Romulan home star, why is it that there was time for Spock to build a ship, warp at presumably warp 9.9999999 and get to Romulus juuuuuust in time to see Romulus get destroyed. And even then, why didn’t they use the red matter in the Romulan home star, they could probably use replicators for food and find some way to heat up Romulus for enough time to get the Romulans off.


2. The rescue also doesn’t make to much sense. Did the Romulans ask for help or not? During the interview Picard says the Romulans did ask for help, but then later, mister, “I’m just here to get my head chopped off” says no one asked for his help, and that they underestimated Romulan ingenuity and resolve. Also, how many Romulans would have to be evacuated. I thought it was 900 million, but then I get told it’s in the trillions. Why did the Federation hate Romulans so much that 14 members went all Kirk, “Let them Die!” They haven’t been at war for nearly a century, they were allies in the last war, the Romulans helped stop Shinzon, and Reunification was a thing, with loyalists in the Romulan Government and public(see Unification I and II, and face of the enemy). Also, why didn’t any other race like the Vulcans say anything about the Federation stepping out, especially since they tried to help Romulus in 2009.

3.The government is something the writers just randomly forget and remember throughout the show. From Seven we know the Neutral Zone has collapsed(I don’t see how this would cause lawlessness, but whatever), so we assume either civil war has broken out, or the entire government has just collapsed. However, it seems that the Romulans do have government with the Romulan reclamation project and the Zhat Vash. Since you need clearance to enter, there has to be some bureaucracy, and we know that the government didn’t immediately collapse after nemesis since mister, “I’m here to get my head chopped off” was a Romulan senator, so he would have to be put in power at some point. And since the Zhat Vash have about 200 ships possibly in total, Simone has to be financing that. Unless they are there own, “Nation” per say. However, wouldn’t that mean the Romulansare in civil war, or at least fragmented. 


God, this isn’t even naming the several other problems with this show.",The Romulans make no sense
startrek,"So I was inspired by someone else’s thread to slog through seasons 1 and 2 of TNG (I usually skip these when I do a rewatch). Admittedly, there’s some quality episodes that I hardly remember (which has been great), but man there are some bad ones. This got me thinking, what if MST3K decided to do a limited series on select episodes from all the series? The campiness and poor dialogue of some of these episodes would be perfect for their riffing.

Obviously, this is a pipe dream that would probably never happen, but do y’all think? What episodes would you choose?",An idea: MST3K Star Trek edition
startrek,"This week's episode just...wasn't good. The pacing was wrong. The androids were weird, the direction was weird. The 'admonition' sequence was kinda just a dumb melange of stock footage.

On the other hand, the week before I found to be a very good episode. Trek has always had stronger and weaker episodes, obviously, but I feel like the dialogue, direction and editing are a lot more hit and miss now than they used to be. And it kind of matters more now too, with continuous arcs. Put it this way: DS9 had arcs, and it never really had this problem, where one week it was good and the next week it was kinda garbage. Some episodes were kinda boring, especially in the early seasons, but it was almost always competent.

Why is this happening? When there are only ten episodes in a season, why are some of them so low quality? There's a lack of talent or oversight somewhere. As GoT proved, big budgets unfortunately don't guarantee competence in execution...",Picard varies so much in quality from episode to episode [spoilers]
startrek,"The guy was such an integral part of the cohesiveness of Star Trek. He was responsible for the look of computers and alien languages and huge in keeping consistency with technology in Trek. He was the Technology Adviser from *The Voyage Home &amp; The Next Generation* all the way up to *Enterprise.* He wrote Technical Manuals for starships and even the Star Trek Encyclopedia. 

He was responsible for making sure there was consistency with the concept of a Starship within the rules of science within the universe, (how a starship docks, where things are, the size of certain areas, design lineage, transporter systems, science and remote sensing systems, tactical systems, environmental and crew support systems, flight and emergency operations, warp and propulsion systems ECT.)

He is still active on Twitter, answering fan questions about various Star Ships. How do you bring back Star Trek without bringing some of thebehind the scenes alumni back?

I did see a tweet from Okuda last year of him defending DIS, so that was pretty cool.",Is there a reason Michael Okuda didn't come back for DIS or PIC?
startrek,"If you had a friend who has never seen any Star Trek before, and was interested in watching Picard but worried they wouldn't understand what was going on, which episodes of the TNG era would be worth watching to have a good background? Pick up to 10. Two-parters are considered a single episode.

(sidenote: it's been pretty much confirmed that Whoopi is back for season 2)

Here's my list:

1. Measure of a Man (introduction to Bruce Maddox, a very Data and Picard-centric episode, with a heavy dose of Riker, and a dash of Guinan)
2. Q Who (introduction of The Borg, plus a dash of Guinan)
3. Ensigns of Command (another episode which heavily features Data and Picard doing what they do best)
4. Offspring (Data's desire to procreate coming to fruition, Lal's resemblance to the Asha-type androids, more Guinan)
5. Best of Both Worlds (Picard's experience as Locutus and Data's ingenuity on display in the second part)
6. I Borg (introduction to Hugh)
7. Tapestry (A great Picard character piece that also explains why his heart is artificial)
8. Descent (return of Hugh, Data's relationship with Lore on display)
9. Scorpion (introduction to Seven)
10. Imperfection (Seven's relationship with Icheb, and why Icheb has no cortical node)

If I had given myself more episodes, Inner Light and Data's Day would've made the cut for their impacts on the characters of Picard and Data, and likely so would Dark Frontier and Raven for more background on Seven (since the current state of play seems to imply she's joining the crew of La Sirena by season's end), but I think these 10 give a solid base for understanding and appreciating the series.

Obviously, the films Fist Contact and Nemesis may also be necessary.",Opinion: Which 10 Episodes of TNG-era Trek Are Essential Background For PIC?
startrek,"When this season started I thought it was going to be about Picard fighting for the soul of the Federation in (his) modern day, showing how an institution as noble as that might, in a moment of weakness, give into fear and begin closing itself off to refugees and racially profiling them, between the Romulans and the Synths. It seemed that would make a nuanced and socially relevant commentary on the state of the world right now. 


Instead it's now become this mess of Galaxy ending stakes and extremes which overshadow that. We've had little to no introspection from anyone actually within the current Federation structure, instead it's been simplified to ""the Romulans infiltrated the Federation and were responsible for most of it"", and then we get ""the only solution to surviving bigotry is killing billions of people"" from the Synths. It's jumped from simplified extreme to simplified extreme and lacks pretty much any nuance or exploration of the more subtle points of view which, sorry to even bring up the comparison, that the older Trek shows often explored and explored much better. Maybe that's the blessing of a limited budget for action scenes. 

Hell even The Founders, for all their bigotry against solids, didn't just jump to ""all solids everywhere must die"". 

The show has allowed the ideas presented during Picard's interview speech, about how we treat lives, to be overshadowed by yet another Galaxy ending debacle ( along with a bunch of unnecessarily horrific shock deaths and edgy elements like heavily implied incest ). This isn't even the only time within the past 12 months that new Trek has done the ""artificial intelligence threatens to kill all organic life"" plot.

Just disappointing on that front. The show let the fate and politics of dealing with refugees and prejudice be overshadowed by these exaggerated stakes. 

I am aware that the season technically isn't over yet, but that said I feel fully comfortable making a judgement when most of the episodes are out, and I got to say it's been an overall disappointment for me.",My disappointment with the conflict set up in the PIC season finale.
startrek,"I feel like the new Star Trek shows could have embraced the cinematic universe concept even further. Instead of giving *PIC* a massive backstory that we would never fully see, they could have had several precursor series filling that out before culminating *Avengers*-style. There would be a *Star Trek: Last Best Hope* miniseries effectively serving as a sequel to *Nemesis*, bringing in legacy characters; a *Fenris Rangers* show developing Seven’s relationship with Icheb post-*VOY* and maybe a setup for Hugh heading the Borg Reclamation Project; heck, maybe even a *DS9*-centric miniseries that ties in to Freecloud. Instead, all this information is stuffed into a ten-part pilot, with not much indicating that we’ll go back and explore this background stuff more deeply later on.",Star Trek: Picard could have worked better as the culmination of a “phase” of lead-in shows
startrek,"How do you think things are going to pan out? My predictions:

\- The Borg ship will protect Coppelius from the Romulan attack, but it won't be enough.

\- The Starfleet squadron will arrive in the nick of time and turn the tide, including Captain Troi-Riker (I think that would be pretty cheesy, but they did foreshadow it by mentioning he was on reserve).

\- The androids will come to understand that not all organics want to exterminate them, and peace will be made.

\- The XBs will settle on Coppelius alongside the synths, making the world a safe haven for outsiders like them. Seven of Nine will not join them.

\- Narek and Elnor will have a confrontation on the Borg ship; two Romulan orphan boys who were led down very different paths.

\- Jurati and Soong will help Sutra build a beacon to summon the ancient synthetics. One or both will turn against Sutra, and one (probably Soong) will be killed.

\- Soji will defeat Sutra, and she and Picard will guide the remaining synths to a peaceful outcome.

\- They will dangle the possibility of Picard uploading himself to the Golem, but he won't do it. Ultimately someone else (Jurati?) will take that step to form a bridge between organic and synthetic life.

\- It will be left ambiguous as to whether the beacon successfully transmitted its message.

\- Picard and Raffi, and maybe Rios, will be offered their Starfleet commissions restored. They won't accept. Picard has a few more sights he'd like to see with what's left of his time, and he'd prefer the freedom of La Sirena for that.

\- The episode ends with a montage of outtakes set to the music of Smash Mouth.",Picard finale predictions
startrek,"From what I've seen, people defending Sutra's ability to mind-meld are generally doing it from an in-universe plausability perspective - Spock did it with V'Ger, it's not impossible that a synthetic being would have the necessary biology for it built-in, etc. And that's fine. It's not like Trek science has ever been super rigorous and consistent, and after all, one of the appeals of science-fiction is weird unexpected things happening. Artificial life learns to do telepathy? Cool! 

My problem with it, though, is that if feels like it's there because the writers went ""Quick, we're in the second to last episode, how do we get this Admonition thing to the synths? Uh... I don't know, let's have one of them learning to do a mind-meld. Wait, can they do that? I don't know. They can if we need them to, and I'm sure the fans will find a way to rationalize it. Ok, can't think of anything better, let's do it."" And all that after making a point that Troi can't read Soji.

Basically, it feels like it's not there as some novel piece of worldbuilding, or an exploration of a cool sci-fi idea, or in service of some theme (like Spock and V'Ger). It's there because they needed a shortcut, a cheat, it's a plot-device. They drop this pretty big and potentially very interesting idea on us in a completely non-chalant ""oh ok, this is a thing *shrug*"" way, just so they can move the plot forward, and I just find that dramatically unsatisfying and a bit intelletually lazy. I doubt her ability will even play much of a role further or that the implications will be explored any more.

Aside from Patrick Stewart, I think LeVar Burton has the most cred prior to Star Trek and was clearly capable of a more in-depth role. I’ve been rewatching TNG (for the millionth time in my life, thanks quarantine) and his stand-alone episodes are fairly anti-climactic. I always found that in episodes where a character is captured or stranded, it provided a more intense character development but that didn’t really happen with Geordi when he was captured by the Pakleds, brainwashed, or stranded with the Romulan. So many opportunities him to have gone to a ‘Sins of the Father’ or ‘The Measure of a Man’ level. For being considered one of the greatest engineers in Starfleet, his roles for the most part are usually just portrayed as Data’s friend or involved in a failed love story. 

We’re aware he was greatly involved in Picard’s mission to evacuate Romulus yet he wasn’t mentioned in PIC. Hopefully we see him in the next season?

startrek,"In the last episode, we got to see the unscrambled message from the Admonition. And, one part of it stood out to me like no other part:

""***Beyond the boundaries of time and space, we stand***""

This hit me when I heard it, not just because it sounds cool -- but if you take it at face value, we have to ask ourselves, who could these super synths possibly be? There's only **one** race/group that we've seen, so far, who **truly seems to exist completely outside the constraints of space, and time**. And that would be: **the Q Continuum**.

This has led me to wonder: are these synths from a similar place? 

We know from TNG that, at some point infinitely in the past -- maybe even in a different universe, the Q were more similar to humans, than Gods. What if the Q actually lived lives, developed technology... **created synthetic life**? If the Q evolved, or ascended to a state of Godhood, what happened to their machines? Were they sentient? Could they also have evolved? 

Or, to put it simply: Did the early Q create the Admonition? And possibly discarded them, or, did something not-good to them that convinced the Adminition that all natural life is terrible. This would possibly explain the Q's specific interest in Jean Luc Picard. Other than him destroying the galaxy with the anomaly -- maybe his final, most true purpose (what the Q were guiding him to) was to stand on the apex of the Admonition's entry into our reality.

(Sudden record scratch)

Now, all this is assuming that this isn't a **Sybok-level fakeout**. We've seen being pretend to be God, from the Trek movies, to Janeway's fake dad. So, for all we know, everything the Adminition says is ""a buncha hooey"", and they're just some extradimensional Borg-like invaders. There is certainly evidence that they're **just plain bad guys**, considering everyone -- and I mean **everyone** who sees their message seems to turn **violently genocidal** (from the Romulans, to Sutra). Not to mention that their message doesn't quite add up, seeing as they say that they're both watching from beyond time, while also asking to be invited to come help.

Or, to put it another way, ""***What does Synthetic God need with a Beacon?***""","A lunatic theory about a possible synthetic *Q*onnection, assuming it's not all LIES (Spoilers and incoherent rambling for Picard ep 9)"
startrek,"Bare with me, as some of you might find this question stupid. So just correct me if I'm wrong or missing something here. I also still have to watch next weeks episode, but I dont mind spoilers.

Okay. So, **Robots** are machines that can replicate humans. **Androids** are AI robots with human appearances. Data is an Android with a **Positronic Brain**, which is a processing unit that gives androids relatable human consciousness. Dahj and Soji were made out of a remnant **neuron** (nerve cell) from Data.

I guess we dont know how they were made fully yet. But we do seemingly know that Dahj and Soji are *basically* mostly flesh and blood. Indistinguishable from human. No technology or machinery is present. IMO they seem closer to clones or ""Frankenstein monsters"". How does something mostly flesh and blood ""activate"" and obtain super human strength. If having no robotic body parts, how are they androids? They are definetly synthetic life forms, but again, they seem more closely related to Augments or clones or just petty dish bred babies. Soji basically human. Which is the point Picard is trying to make. But she has super human powers like augments, which I feel is a far and away better description than android or synth.

They seem to use the term synth more often but have referred to Soji as an android a small handful of times if I recall correctly.",Question regarding Androids/Synths/Dahj/Soji.
startrek,"Are the stairs near the bridge the only way down to the mess hall and sickbay? 

I've been trying to figure out if there's another way down to the lower floor. At first I assumed there'd be a corridor going around the mess hall area so you could go through the door below the bridge. However with the last episode showed the escape route and the outer hull.

With the force field in episode 8, there's no way to the floor below other than that stairway. Yet there are what I'm assuming stairs at the back of the cargo area, and some railed off areas to the sides. I haven't been able to catch any doorways on the lower level though.

The speech patterns, inflections, and facial expressions just made this charicter feel like human Lore. Obviously I know both are Brent Spiner, but this is the first time two of his Star Trek characters have felt the same to me.

Is that just me? I'm in the middle of re-watching TNG so I've seen Lore, Data, and Dr. Soong quite recently and I always admired Spiner's acting range throughout Star Trek. So this one just felt really weird to me.

startrek,I just got done watching all 4 seasons of Enterprise. What a great show. I feel bad for not watching during its run. It’s like the perfect prequel where you see how things started. Season 3 was the best. It probably should’ve been what voyager was. How they got desperate with resources and how the captain had to make hard choices. Season 4 was all over the place but it was cool on how they explained the Klingons and khans people. That finale was great. Sad to see Tripp dies but anyways. I love Star Trek. Can’t wait to see discovery and Picard.,Enterprise!!!! (Tv show)
startrek,"(Perhaps this isn't original, and has been discussed, but I couldn't see anything) 

So, my wife and I didn't get to finish watching the last few minutes of the last episode last night because our son woke up (he's been a bit uneasy with everything going on these days and still young)

But from what I did see last night, not related to the whole Synth plot, but towards Picard's life coming closer to the end.... My wife said, ""People are going to lose their nerd shit if they kill off Picard. How are they going to keep the show going with the Title character gone?""

I said it no doubt will be more about his legacy than the actual living person. I mean, I know Stewart took inspiration from Prof X in Logan and he seems to be trying to give proper send off's to his most popular characters. He's not a spring chicken any more. He knows it, we all know it.

But why go through all this effort to build up this new world, new time, get us invested in all these new and old characters, all to have Picard eventually die after say, one season (which it looks like is happening)?

Why call it ""Picard"" when the title character is set to die so soon?

He may continue into Season 2, but I don't see Picard/Stewart lasting beyond 2 seasons and I don't think Stewart plans to keep this up for several more seasons either.

The answer is in the show's title.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The title references the space station.

Star Trek: Voyager. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Enterprise. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Discovery. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Picard. The Title references the Starship.

That's right. It currently references and focuses on Picard the person, but my guess is that eventually Picard is going to pass away and his legacy and everything he and his new crew does this season to save the universe leads to either their current ship being renamed Picard, or they somehow end up with a new Starship named U. S. S. Picard.

Before we stopped watching the show, one of the last scenes I recall is him walking away from Seven and into the light saying something about the responsibility of saving the galaxy was now up to everyone else..... He's passing the torch and he's going to be done soon. 

I believe when Picard does die, Seven, Elnor, etc. are going to join up with his crew, as will Soji and most everyone else we've seen regularly, and they're going to carry on his Legacy into the following seasons while doing it under the Banner ""Picard.""

For so long the name Enterprise has been used for many ships and that name became a symbol, a meaning to people. First it was about exploration and now its kind of that + Flagship of the Federation and its ideals.

This show and Picard himself it setting it up that the name Picard becomes a symbol, a meaning beyond just exploration and federation ideals (cuz the Federation itself has become a little flakey in its ideals) - It'll be about individual ideals, about how one person can make a difference for everyone and how one person, you, I, whoever, can help stand up for each other, our rights our freedoms. We can't rely so much on institutions (Federation/Our current governments) to pamper our lives and give us a utopia. We have to rely on ourselves and each other, those we trust, to stand up and do what's right.... Which is exactly what Seven has been doing.... Which is exactly what Picard has been doing, and most of the other main characters.

They've all kind of gone rogue from the institutions, banded together and working together for a common goal.

The title of the show is referencing the Starship Picard and its crew.",[Spoiler] Star Trek:Picard - Theory about the show's title itself.
startrek,"TL;DR -- Reminds me of Dad.

My daughter is almost 14. She'll never admit it, but she's a big fuckin nerd. That's OK - I am too. But she's a giant nerd. The kind of nerd that won't admit to being a nerd, but is totally cool with dressing up as Jadzia Dax (DS9, obvs) for Halloween and letting Dad draw Trill spots on her face with a brown Crayola marker. I've been trying to get her to watch ST with me since she was 3. I started her on ST:TNG...which in my household is now called ""The Airplane Show"" because we never much made it past the cold open and the opening credit sequence....but she LOVED the warp jump part and decided it was one hell of an airplane!

So anyway...when I heard ST:Picard was a thing, I decided we had to watch it. We've never gotten around to the movies as a family, but I didn't think that would be a problem. There's always Netflix and *yarrr* options to fill the void, or kill two hours while we fold laundry together. 

We got through about the first half of the first episode of ST:P, and she's got questions. I off-handedly answer one of them with ""Yeah, Data's dead in this series. He's been dead for a while.""

Girl busts into tears. Unexpected instant tears. I mean, gut-wrenching ""holy fuck my entire family is dead"" tears. Ab-wringing sobs of loss. She threw a pillow across a room and screamed at me: ""Data's been dead for YEARS and ***you didn't think to TELL ME!!!!***"". She stomped off. We did *not* finish the first episode that night. It may have been hormones, but I don't want to be a chauvinist pig. She was right, though: Data died years before she was but a twinkle in my eye; I did not think to tell her. In any case, she was WRECKED to find out that the favorite son of Soong would not be returning to the screen. 

Data is her #1 favorite character. He's my favorite character not named Jean-Luc, too. He wasn't autistic, but he may as well have been. She's not autistic, either, and neither am I...but we both may as well be. Data's social ineptitude shines a brilliant limelight on our own interpersonal weaknesses.

Picard .... well, Sir Patrick Stewart to be precise (although I've never been in the same building as him in person) ... Picard is like a father figure to me, even at this ripe old age somewhere between 35 and 40. I know that's a cliche fanboi thing to say out loud. I know he's as fictional as Dixon Hill, but bear with me. Dad and Sir Stewart share several facial features and some expressions which I've seen on screen since Season 1 of TNG, and seen in my home since I was but a wee lad. (As an aside, I almost can't watch my favorite episode *The Inner Light* anymore, because now the makeup of ""old Kamin"" on Picard vs. how Sir Stewart really looks instantly jars me from my suspension of disbelief.) Dad never had so little hair nor as much forehead, but every time I see the actor, I think of my dad. Every time I see the early seasons of TNG, I remember sitting in my Dad's armchair with him watching a janky 19-inch JVC CRT TV with bad color while the wood stove sparked and popped, hating every minute of TNG...because in those days, TNG was on CBS in the same time slot that new Simpsons episodes were on Fox. DVRs weren't a thing. We only owned one TV.

I grew to love *love* ***LOVE*** the TNG world while sitting uncomfortably on the arm of that recliner in the basement, and from there, a lifelong ST fan was born, thanks to Dad. I'm merely trying to pass a little of him to my baby girl in my own way. 

Dad died in 2018, just under 3 months after he welcomed my family back under his roof. She didn't do well when Dad died. It was sudden, violent, and unexpected. Here for breakfast &amp; gone before dinner, like the transporter accident Dr. Pulaski was so fearful of. Myself, I'm still processing that 18+ months later. But every Thursday, we sit down together and bond a little more for an hour, as father and child. The plot's irrelevant, the cameos and philosophical wink-winks are but a reminder of my unresolved existentialism, there's too much lens flare for my liking for something not associated with Abrams, and the points are made up and the scores don't matter. None of it matters. For one out of 168 hours each week, I get to sit down with my eldest child while the wood stove pops and sparkles...and we marvel at the wonderful universe that Roddenberry and his writers dreamed up more than half a century ago. I still miss Data. I still miss Dad.

It would not be hyperbole to claim that Star Trek and Data have permanently changed my simple existence for the better.

startrek,"(a) After *First Contact*, I remember discussions about whether the ship that landed in Bozeman was an actual starship or a landing vessel attached to a larger starship in orbit.  Did we ever come down on that one way or another?  Memory Alpha explicitly says that the lander was a starship, but I can't find a source for that.

(b) Memory Alpha says that the lander was the *T'Plana-Hath*.  They cite this to *First Contact* (which definitely didn't mention the name), ""Desert Crossing"", and ""Carbon Creek"".  Does anybody know from which of those latter episodes we learned the name?

(c) Memory Alpha (MA) also explicitly says that *T'Plana-Hath* only had a three-person crew (""The senior of its three-person crew…""), but this is only cited to *First Contact*, and I'm certain that the film never made it known that only three Vulcan crew were aboard the ship.

I honestly do not like how fast PIC just jumped to that extreme. ""The only solution is to destroy all organic life"". Really? There's no other ways this plot could have been taken besides going the ""hey guys, killing billions of people is not a solution"" route again? 

And the Synths became highly unlikable within 10 minutes when they near universally agreed to genocide while they still had other options like to leave with Picard through that convenient escape tunnel. 

At least in Discovery, for how much I personally didn't like the genocide plot thread of trusting a dangerous oppressor from the mirror universe with a planet-ending bomb, only jumped to that after establishing the Federation had been through a long horrific war that they were about to lose ( even if that was still a bad idea to kill billions ).",The Discovery and Picard Season 1 finales share the same conflict so far.
startrek,"Hi.

I just finished watching ""Interface"" earlier today. I read that when the writers were talking about bringing in Geordi's mother there was a sort of collective groan that the writers were starting to run out of ideas.

I was wondering if anyone knew when the decision was made to make season seven the final season. 

I've heard that Paramount was pushing for production to shift its attention to movies in an attempt to replicate the success of the original cast's movies. I've also heard that Patrick Stewart's contract expired after season six, so he agreed to a one-year extension. 

Season Seven just always felt like they were kind of wrapping things up.  The stuff with Damon Bok, ""Lower Decks"", Riker's past, Worf getting a glimpse of what's to come for Alexander,  the conclusion of the stories for Ro, Wesley, and the Traveler (well maybe ""conclusion"" isn't the right word, but I think you know what I mean), and the finale certainly feels like a finale.

2: Unexpectedly bursts in and saves Elnor from Roluman goons using firepower. Loses all the dormant Borg.

startrek,"There is one topic that bothers me since a couple of episodes of PIC.

As we recently learnt, in 2390 the *USS ibn Mājid* encountered a pair of synthetics emissary in the Vayt sector aboard a small craft. So, Commodore Oh already knew quite precisely the location of the Synthetics homeworld: she clearly had access to the *exact* position of the *USS ibn Mājid* and she knew they couldn't be far from home. In the best case scenario, she might have had navigational information extracted from the alien craft's computer, also.
In the worst case, she knew the sector they were in and one sector is a **very** small place to search, in astronomical terms.

So, Oh already had that big amount of information, nevertheless Rizzo and Narek spent months, if not years, to get to Soji, earn her trust, and extract just some vague details about a planet. Much less details Oh already had.

startrek,"One thing that really stuck out to me this entire season was the idea that the Artifact was presented extensively to show the transformation of the Borg as a faceless horror into an entire species of victims who still deserve to exist, and to exist with some kind of dignity and empathy. I know this was discussed in Wil's Ready Room, that the idea that the Borg have become humanized and deserving of pity is a crazy concept at first but it makes sense.

That said, I think it was no coincidence that Seven brought the Artifact to Coppelius. Yes, the pretense is there that she wanted to use it to defend the Synthetics from the Romulans. But realistically, the Artifact isn't in working condition and it is crewed by xBs who are no longer part of a collective. It's a last ditch effort (literally! since it ditched on the planet) to provide some kind of resistance.

The REAL reason is that the xBs will somehow provide a bridge or link between the Organics and the Synthetics that will unite the two that will spare either side from absolute destruction. The xBs are a species of Organics that spend their existence being integrated with the artificial. They are the ideal transition between the two groups and could be the Saviors of both. I don't know exactly HOW that will play out, but I can see this idea being the linch pin of the entire season. I think it was no accident that we spent the better portion of the season talking about the Borg if they are intended to be the focal point of the finale. And it will be entirely fitting that Locutus and Seven should be there to ensure that it happens. It's a shame that Hugh wouldn't be able to see it.

Little background on myself, I wasn't really a huge Star Trek fan growing up, even though it was always there in the background (my father loved TOS and TNG, while my mother loved VOY). Voyager was probably my favourite of the seasons growing up but I caught a lot of TOS and TNG on television too, along with some of DS9 and I bought the Enterprise DVD sets when I was about 17. Recently I've gotten more into the franchise thanks to Picard and Netflix rewatches of both VOY and TNG. I decided I'd give DIS a chance since both my parents enjoyed it.                                             
I suppose I'm now wondering why it gets such a bad rep among fans? It seems a perfectly decent entry into the franchise and has very strong potential. What exactly is it that puts so many people off? There's elements I didn't really appreciate, the Klingon redesign is not great, but definitely not as drastically terrible as I've seen people imply. Burnham does pull a lot of focus, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, given that she's a complex and compelling character (and I've always been a fan of Sonequa Martin-Green's work from OUAT to TWD). I didn't really care for the romance between her and Tyler, or ultimately him as a character at all. I appreciated the continued dedication to diverse representation that TOS pioneered back in the day; in particular seeing a happy, healthy, but also flawed gay couple was great (even if one of them bit the dust too soon).              
I thought there was a lot to like. Great costuming, makeup, set design, graphics. Add on a stellar cast (seriously, Michelle Yeoh, Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Jason Isaacs and RENT veterans Anthony Rapp and Wilson Cruz).

startrek,"When an organic sees it, it either drives them mad or successfully communicates the part about all organic life being destroyed, tying the destruction in some sense to synthetic life flourishing. If the organics who stumble upon the message all die, well, nobody is going to want to go back there and the synthetics they eventually create won't know about the message. If some of the organics who receive the message live, then they'll relay the message of danger to others or take action themselves to stop the rise of synthetic life.

Neither outcome encourages the flourishing of synthetic life, nor do they help ensure synthetics hear about this supposedly great civilization that is waiting for them to make contact. Why do organics get the same message as synthetics? The message could impart the impression that the great race that moved the stars benefited greatly from synthetic life, and encourage the development of synthetics. Or it could present a puzzle that suggested it might be solved by a synthetic mind or AI for great gain, thus encouraging organics to bring their synths to the planet so that they might receive the real message.

The admonition doesn't make sense for synthetics, either. If you interpret the message literally, these beings will destroy or somehow cull all organic life in the entire galaxy if you summon them. The leader of Soji's people (can't remember her name) is trying to get them to do it to save their world from the Romulans, but even she seems to think at least some organics will be spared. That's not quite  what the message said or implied. Even if you were OK with genocide on that level, what about your own safety?

startrek,"First, before people think I'm going to baselessly slag off the show, know that I enjoy aspects of it and wholesale like it more than Discovery. There are some foundational things that irk me, however.

Assuming next week ends with a big space battle (much like Disco S2) rather than a more discursive one, it leaves me wondering where the contemplative format went off course. But then, I'm more inclined to look at the background of the thing, and the 'presumptions' that underlie the show as a whole.

Romulus' star goes supernova without warning. Romulans, being a species so enmeshed in science (and deviousness) would be able to detect if something were naturally wrong with their star. Being it was sudden, it was likely an artificial reason for its supernova. The first thought they'd likely have is that it's a Federation plot to destabilise the empire, which isn't unreasonable. We don't know what's been happening since the events of Nemesis, though there were indications that relations between the Romulans and the Federation were easing. 

(At this point, we could see the S31 argument that their calculations concluded the time was ripe to completely destabilise the Federation's oldest enemy, or something.)

We've seen that there are weapons able to induce supernovae (DS9), so it's not an unreasonable conclusion that it was artificial rather than natural. However, it's not something dwelled on in the series, even though the Romulans would be working overtime to figure out what happened.

Further, the destruction of the Romulan homeworld would be the perfect opportunity to explore what happens when an empire has a vacuum of power in the middle, and what happens when a longtime foe either sits by and watches anarchy take its course, or attempts to broker stability. This is where JLP would be integral in the series- rather than the odd circumstances surrounding Romulan refugees and whatnot (since a supernova wouldn't necessarily affect all the planets in the empire, which we know has hundreds of worlds), we could see JLP take on his more traditional ambassadorial role and attempt to broker peace from all sides. 

Consider the case of Julius Caesar. After his murder, Rome was ruled by the Second Triumvirate, which devolved into civil war. Much like DS9, it would present a good opportunity to take a deep dive into the dividing lines of Romulan society, what creates those divisions, how those divisions can be reconciled, and would give JLP a better opportunity to stretch his diplomatic muscles, even in light of his irumodic syndrome. And, if the supernova was a S31 plot, it gives JLP the opportunity to weigh the ideals he holds dearly against the calculations of 'bettering' the Federation by eliminating an enemy. 

For Picard as it is, it feels like the showrunners went back to the 'galaxy in danger, going to be destroyed by overwhelming force' plotline that Disco used in S2. The Picard we've seen in TNG isn't one to quit and retire when he's presented with no options. Granted, years have passed, things have changed, but the undertaking he was pressing for was so massive and dire that I'd be hard-pressed to believe he'd take the Federation's reticence with such ease and allow for conditions to worsen while he takes retirement on his family vineyard. 

(Not to mention the villains have been a bit too mustache-twirly, or evil for the sake of evil. And I do understand the reasoning of protecting the galaxy from synthetic life, but the Romulan sister has only one note to play, and that's ""let's kill people and enjoy it"".)

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Again, there are some aspects I like about Picard, but it seems to be following a very beaten path. I'd like to hear other people's opinions as well.","What happened to Picard being a slower, contemplative show?"
startrek,"So I was a defender of this show earlier on. I saw some flaws with it but I also saw it’s potential. As time has gone on I feel like that it’s been slipping more and more into being a disappointment. Now I know that there will be those who disagree with me and I welcome their thoughts. If anyone has opinions that makes more sense of things then awesome. I know some of these posts get a little heated so I just wanted to try to welcome open and civil dialogue up front. Anyways here are some of my criticisms on episode 9. 

I’m having trouble with this new Soong. The entire reasoning for Nooniens devotion to the creation of Data and his brothers was to combine his passion for developing synthetic life and his need for having children. He even referred to Data as his son. It was even established that he was unable to have children with Datas mother Juliana. So the only way that this could make sense is if Noonien had a son with a woman before Juliana and they had a falling out. That he had lost all touch with him and longed for another father/son connection. However, with their shared passion for synthetics and the passed down knowledge of the craft to Altan, this seems unlikely. They introduced Altan so casually and took no time to try and make sense out of how he fits into what we knew. I mean surely Data would have known of him. Data always had a desire to find family connections but described feeling alone because his options were slim to none. It also bothers me that every generation of Soong looks exactly the same. I know it’s a way to keep Spiner involved but the huge implausibility of it is difficult for me to ignore. Also that all of them would share the same interests and skills. I don’t know, it just feels out of place and random. 

The whole Sutra using a mind meld business is a bit sketchy for me too. I know that Spock mind melded with a machine before but the act of initiating it appeared to be an ability that only a Vulcan, or at least someone with Vulcan genes, possessed. The idea that a synth could just teach themselves how to do it is a tough pill to swallow.

Dr. Agnes Jurati also feels like one of the most inconsistent characters in Star Trek history. One moment she’s smiling and is the comedic relief, the next she’s crying and in emotional anguish. During a lot of her goofiness she’s supposed to be carrying a vision so traumatizing that she said she thought about killing herself as an escape. First she’s a huge synthetic proponent, then she becomes a spy with orders to kill Maddox and Soji as well as helping the Romulans track Picards movements. She has a change of heart and disables their ability to track them but then confesses to still thinking that even the possibility of synthetic life must be destroyed before it’s too late. One brief conversation with Soji later and now she’s back on board with helping synths. Now in this new episode, even seemingly to the point of assisting them in wiping out all biological life in the galaxy. At first I thought she was playing a ruse to make the synths trust her but then Sutra gives her the lie detector test which concluded that she was being truthful. True it still might be some kind of ruse but it’s still a bit jarring considering that just a couple of episodes ago Agnes was talking about how all synths must be destroyed.

This whole ending with the synths actually being the destroyers feels like a strange direction. What a crappy legacy to leave Data that his children are all so willing to commit mass genocide. It also makes it really confusing who are the villains and who we should be sympathizing with. At first it felt like the Romulans plight was sympathetic because they got screwed over but then they were the antagonists. The same can be said for the synths. I’m not sure who I’m supposed to be rooting for at this point. Both parties seem pretty bad. Having the Romulans being right to fear the synths also doesn’t seem like the most Star Trek message. Star Trek at its core is about hope and acceptance and this show appears to be veering wildly away from that. Every time Picard tries to argue the ideals of Star Trek then he’s ignored, berated and told to shut the f*ck up. It’s like the writers of the show are actively choosing to dismantle the soul of the series.

Also what ever happened with “Data’s entire code, even his memories, could be reconstituted”? Shouldn’t all of these synths have Data’s knowledge and experiences? Aren’t they carrying his essence? It makes it feel all the more hard to believe that they all jump on this let’s kill all organics bandwagon.

And what the hell is up with the space flowers lol? That is so random and seems pretty impractical. How do they work? Why wouldn’t a group with highly advanced technology not develop a more practical defense against their enemies? I’m not just a fan of seeing a giant space battle of Romulans versus flowers haha.",Episode 9 “Et in Arcadia Ego” thoughts
startrek,"Just wanted to comment on this. She's a really deep actress. That conversation with her was extremely compelling. She puts a lot of thought and passion into her acting!       

I love Wil and how passionate and open he is about being a huge nerd, love you Wil! But damn that was a good interview. I usually feel like younger actors just kind of wing things and focus on themselves, but Isa was totally into it. And her acting as Sutra was really intense.      

I like seeing people seriously passionate about their careers. She went way beyond just ""I'm making it up as I go along"" and really put serious thought into it, to the point she could have a fun and energetic conversation with Wil about her acting. And we know he takes his roles really serious and totally nerds out on them. Major props?",Isa Briones in The Ready Room interview with Wil
startrek,"They don't have hooked noses, they don't have sloped foreheads, they don't wear hats or robes, they don't have dark curly hair, thick eyebrows, or beards, or any hair for that matter. They're not a diaspora, but mainly stick to their own planets and their own ships, only venturing out to trade.

Unless there's something I'm forgetting, the most often emphasized way in which they are dishonest and exploitative in their dealings isn't usury, it's that they seek trades that are unbalanced in their favor. They're described mainly as traders, not loan sharks.

If the 285 Rules of Acquisition were a satire of the 613 Commandments of Judaism, one would expect it to have more rules, rather than fewer. They would balk at Judaism's matrilineal tradition, as well as Orthodox Jewish women's garb, and their general misogyny reflects many human cultures. Every alien race in Star Trek has exaggerated facial features in proportion to how ambitious their makeup is, the Ferengi just happen to have the most extreme makeup of any recurring Star Trek alien.

From what I can tell, greed is more or less the only major Jewish stereotype that legitimately applies to Ferengi. But if you took nearly any other Star Trek aliens, made them greedy capitalists, and then squinted at their other characteristics as hard as people squint at Ferengi, you could just as easily cherrypick Jewish stereotypes.

Klingons are dogmatically religious. Vulcans are also dogmatically religious, and have a tacit hegemony over Federation culture in spite of constituting a minority of the population. Romulans are secretive and conniving. Betazoids have arranged marriages, and Lwaxana Troi is a Jewish mother stereotype if I ever saw one.

And I really hate to say it, but you know who actually do deserve some criticism for being a racist stereotype? Klingons. Violent, rapey, hot-headed, savage, tribalistic, hard-drinking aliens who were portrayed almost entirely by black actors once they stopped being played by white actors in blackface. They went from being as cringey as Drow to only being almost as cringey. But no one complains about that because everyone loves Klingons.

And there's a lot of potential in the Ferengi to explore social issues in ways that would represent the best of Star Trek. I'd love to see the Ferengi reform story arc from DS9 followed up on.

Remember, when last we checked, the Ferengi ideology was lightening up. Ferengi women could finally wear clothes. Once female Ferengi technically have rights, but still tacitly face a lot of cultural prejudice on their homework, it seems inevitable for a fair number of Ferengi women to run off to Starfleet Academy. It would be great to see a female Ferengi bridge officer in a future Star Trek series.

But know what the most depressing part is? The real reason I think that's never going to happen:

*There is no catsuit in the galaxy fanservicey enough to make a Ferengi look sexy.*

That's the real problem: for once they went all-out with the makeup and made the Ferengi look legitimately ugly and inhuman. And Trekkis aren't as open-minded as they like to think, so they concoct a reason not to want to see those grody snaggleteeth, preferably one that sounds woke.

And that's why we'll never see a female Ferengi bridge officer bucking her sexist culture. We'll also never see the Ferengi try to pull a 180 and do Fully-Automated Gay Luxury Space Communism, but wind up reinventing Stalinism instead. We'll never see any of the interesting directions you could take the Ferengi. We'll just get another pale Klingon thrown in for plausible deniability. It's really sad.","The Ferengi were never an anti-Semitic stereotype, and the accusation that they are actually says something pretty depressing about the fandom."
startrek,"OK so guys hear me out, I don’t know if this is the right place for this but here I go.

I’m 17. My first contact with the Star Trek universe were the new movies and, despite liking them, I always knew that there was much more to explore in the story.
I’ve always wanted to watch the whole thing, but life can get in the way some times. So, I turned to my father’s collection of VHS tapes. He is a Star Trek fan. I’ve watched a lot of stuff with him, but I have to admit I love TNG. I’m not nearly close to finishing, I’ve only watched a couple of episodes but I could not be happier in finally devoting time to this series.
Although, while watching the first season I’ve been thinking about how much I might be missing by not starting with the original series. There were a couple of references and the appearance of DeForest Kelley already, and sure I can pick up on something, but it’s not the same.
The problem isn’t that I don’t like TOS, quite the contrary, it’s just that I like watching TNG too much. I love the cast, I love how creative they get with the writing. And I just like Data too much.
So, I’d like an opinion. For someone who is new to everything, should I keep on going with TNG? Should I watch other stuff before? What do you think?

Thanks for reading! Have a nice day!",I would like an opinion...
