startrek,"What I mean by that:

Often times the main characters encounter some kind of danger or pursue some kind of hint which sends them traveling through the galaxy, spanning great distances, jumping in and out of warp, etc.

The main characters of course know what's up: Captain Picard gives the order to ""set course for X, maximum warp!"" and off they go.

Or they get attacked and suddenly have to travel halfway across the galaxy. Or they orbit around a seemingly random planet because an away team hasn't returned.

The main characters as well as we, the viewers, obviously know what's up, why they're jumping from planet A to planet B in short succession or what just hit the enterprise to cause damage on decks 17 through 19.

But what about the ""normal"" personell? The regular people hanging out at the bar? On the holodeck? The families in their quarters?

How do they experience these seemingly random warp jumps? One moment they're looking out the window, maybe talking to a relative at home and then _WOOSH!! WARP 9 IN YOUR FACE!!_

Are they somehow informed on a moment-to-moment basis? Do they know that a Romulan ship just uncloaked infront of the Enterprise? Or are they left in the dark?

I'd be so confused all the time, never knowing where we are or _why_ we are there.

Is there a story or maybe even an episode from the perspective of a ""regular person"", not knowing what's happening around them?",Rewatching TNG and have a question: How are the general personnel/regular people on board informed about travels and warp jumps?
startrek,"First of all, sorry for my English or my mistakes.

I love ST Picard, but there's a big problem with starfleet ship designs. There are only a few original models: the Inqury-Class, the Utopia Planitia space tug, Mars defense ships and the McCall Shuttlecraft. But the Magee-Class (seen in Short Treks: Children of Mars) and the Class C Shuttlecraft are from the pre-TOS era! Why are 150 year-old ships still operational?

Let's try to answer. Obviously, the budget of the show was quite limited, but here's my ST canon theory:

In the 2230s the Class C Shuttlecraft was introduced. It was used in some starships and as a carrier on Earth until 2260s, and then it was replaced with other models, but it was still being used because of it's success (and maybe during its life it was updated a few times). I think some variants of this shuttle were the Galileo-class shuttlecraft (TOS era films), the Type 6 Shuttlecraft (a shorter version onboard the Enterprise D) and Type 7 Shuttlecraft (Enterprise D). After a century of using the Class C, I think the Federation reached the point of building tons of these crafts at a very low price. So that's why it's still in use.

What about the Magee-Class science vessel? This ship was an innovation when it was introduced in the 2250s, due to its compact configuration. Maybe it had modern technology enough to mantain the production. It's the same as the Miranda-Class ship (like the USS Reliant): It was still in use in the late 24th century (seen in DS9 and VOY) because of its power.

So that's my explanation, i hope you liked it.",150 years old ships in Picard?

startrek,"The rebooted Star treks have some bright spots but my favorite was Cumberbatch as Kahn. He played it perfect and actually made me a big fan of Kahn. 

Considering how much trouble the sequel series has seen I’d say if we get a fourth it has got to be downright amazing!! So I would use a tried and true enemy like Kahn combined with one of fans favorite enemies ever, the borg. 

The next generation and piccard first encounter the borg and time travel has been a big part of this go around so maybe even find a way to use both the original and use the film to introduce the next generation crew so the 5th movie would be a reboot of piccards crew.

startrek,"Recently finished watching the show, I generally like to keep my hard sci fi (The Expanse, Gattaca, Permutation city) and science fantasy(Numenera, Q who) clearly defined, but the production value of star trek discovery helped me overlook its space magic aspects and appreciate it for what it is.

Recently heard that  people were calling Michael Burnham a mary sue and I don't understand how that is. I have called out many characters as mary sues/gary stus and she does not seem to fit the criteria.

She is multidisciplinary in competence, but not much more so than a science officer(who typically have knowledge in multiple disciplines) who used to be a first officer and was training to be a captain. But most of her greater achievements were in her main field (figuring out the Klingon greeting, ""taming"" the tardigrade, which was sentient).

She is in the military, so she may have training in combat, but she loses up to 70% of the hand to hand fights she is in. Even against Sarek, she lost multiple times until she subdued him once (which is all she needed),  against the Klingon ""emperor"" she lost decisively, but he was toying with her so she had a chance to escape.

Most of her fights never end decisively, they end with either an escape or help from a friend.


So I just don't see how she is that special, other than being a major ""pov"" character.",How is Michael Burnham a Mary sue though?
startrek,"Hey everyone. To start, I want to say that I know a Star Trek tabletop rpg exists. I've looked into it, don't like it, and want to totally homebrew a Star Trek game using 5e rules as a base. I'm an experienced DM of 5e and love some homebrew.

Instead of classes like rogue, ranger, warlock, etc , I want to use officers. Instead of races like elf, dwarf, halfling, etc., I want to use core Star Trek races like Klingon, Vulcan, Romulan, etc. 

Honestly, I'm really only familiar with Next Gen (my fiancee got me converted me from Star Wars to Star Trek a few years back) and I would love any tiny little contribution for how these races/classes would work. I'm not asking for anyone to do the hard yards, just shit you might expect playing this game. Obvious examples might be a strength bonus for Klingons or Vulcans or a Charisma bonus for 1st officers or proficiency bonus for Engineering officers.

Same thing with inability to talk more about relationships and sex, and it;s very possible without being too graphic (the scene in the cabin in The Apple is one example, but there are so many...).

startrek,"Since the Borg are predominantly a Delta Quadrant power and their ""space"" is mostly in the DQ. Wouldn't it be a bit of a stretch for Starfleet to continously encounter Borg vessels both in and out of the DQ that are manned by Alpha and Beta Quadrant species? Especially species on the far side of Federation space?

I would assume that Beta Quadrant heavy species like the Romulans and Klingons would be more likely to find themselves assimilated due to proximity. I know it's more than reasonable that a Borg cube passing through the general area near Federation space has a high chance of running into humans, vulcans and other Federation citizens. But for the amount of times we see them in Voyager you'd think the majority of drones would be representative of DQ species. But even there we are often introduced to humans and other Alpha/Beta Quadrant species that should be extremely rare on that side of the galaxy. 

Is there anything in Trek lore that tries to address this? Are borg incursions more frequent than the shows let on?",Is there any explanation for the widespread appearance of Alpha and Beta Quadrant Species found in the Borgs ranks?
startrek,"TLDR:  Star Trek always kind of ignores or minimizes the gruesome and terrible things that happen to the characters.  Are there any books or episodes that really examine the horror that comes from the Star Trek universe?

Long Version:  

So here's something that's always bugged me about Star Trek.  These people live in a world where they can suffer all manner of horrible deaths or injury, but nobody ever really talks about it and there never seem to be any real consequences.  Some of this stuff is straight-up nightmare fuel.  I'm talking about the crewman whose face gets removed (""Charlie X""), or the one who gets fused halfway into the floor (""In Theory""), or the ones who get turned into soup in a transported accident (""The Motion Picture"").  And the rest of the characters just go about their day, sometimes barely acknowledging what just happened.

There are a rare few episodes that really explore guilt and PTSD (eg. ""Family"" or ""It's Only a Paper Moon""), but these aren't nearly as common as they should be.  Most of the time it's just, ""Oh, that one lady got turned into a geometric piece of chalk, what was her name again?""  (“By Any Other Name"")  But I'm not really talking about PTSD stemming from combat or conventional deaths.  I'm more interested in the people who get turned into reptiles and other weird shit.   (I know Captain Bateson from ""Cause and Effect"" had a few appearances in novels and comic books that followed up on his story, and I thought that was really interesting.)

Shouldn't there be an asylum somewhere full of people suffering bizarre medical conditions and hideous deformities?  In ""Charlie X"" the aliens undo all the hideous things Charlie did, so it is assumed that the lady got her face back.  But what if there was a hospital somewhere trying to treat a woman whose face was obliterated?  Or cages housing half-human reptiles the Federation hasn't figured out how to cure?  What would it really be like trying to stay sane in a universe where, at any random moment, some space-time fluctuation could fuse your body into the bulkhead?  Or some alien God could snap his fingers and transform you into a D20?  It seems like being confined to a beeping wheelchair is actually kind of merciful compared to some of the horrible fates these people suffer. 

Is there any media (books, episodes, whatever) that really explores the long-term consequences of these things?",Star Trek Horror?
startrek,"Inspired by a post on a different thread where someone said many Vulcan actors confuse stoicism for being mean.

We all know that Vulcans can be boring assholes from whatever we've seen of them, but how much of this is simply informed by Spock, who is half-human? He had a very real reason for clinging to his Vulcan side, almost in a fanatical way we see Worf vs other Klingons.

I've always found it interesting that for all their logic, Vulcans never seem to find it might be easier to get along and work with humans through a ""when in Rome"" approach. 

This brings me to Xon, one of the three principle new characters for the unfilmed Phase II show and the only one not to be rewritten into The Motion Picture. We see that already he doesn't have the bowl-cut that Spock popularized (even his father's hair wasn't quite so uniform in TOS), and that his approach to being on the Enterprise was one where he sought integration rather than isolation - basically the opposite of Spock and more similar to Data. That is, being young and untested, he might awkwardly belly-laugh at a light joke when amongst a bunch of humans, so as to fit in. And because he doesn't have that human mother, there's nothing for him to tap into it when he really needs to. Rather than struggling his whole life to accept and integrate humanity from within, he would have to find it from with out. From the series bible:

&gt; What this means is: whereas Spock was engaged in a constant battle with himself to repress his emotions in order to be more Vulcan-like, Xon will be engaged in a constant struggle within himself to release his buried emotions to be more Human-like for the sake of doing a good job, his primary considerations. This will be at least as difficult for him as it was for Spock to maintain his stoic pose. Also, we'll get humor out of Xon trying to simulate laughter, anger, fear, and other Human feelings.

Being so early in the series, this could have redefined how Vulcans were perceived and written for the next 40 years. It troubles me so much that the monocultural tendencies of Star Trek have meant that basically all Vulcans are the same character, derived heavily from a guy who was only half-Vulcan. It would be a bit more like that Enterprise episode where the Vulcans crash in the past and the one guy decides he likes Earth. Just seems more realistic, and with more room for interesting development, to me.",Could Xon have changed the way Vulcans were written?

startrek,"It has been a while since I’ve been on my mission to explore all the Star Trek Universe out there. I’m a new fan and discovering this franchise has brought to me such joyous feelings I can’t even describe.

I’ve started watching TNG for a while now on every free time that I have. I have never had so much fun watching a series ever. If I’m not mistaken, it has been 33 years since the airing of the first episode and still, I managed to not know anything about it. I’m just discovering it all along this marvelous path.

Recently, I got to Season 5 and I gotta say... What a jump. S4 and S5 are completely different worlds to me. I feel like everything has been taken to another level, and it was already a really high one. 
Episode 2: “Darmok” was amazing. Something about it just feels new and refreshing despite having these characters that I’ve seen for so long now. The camera work is much more inspiring. The acting, my God. We all know how much Patrick Stewart is simply a master at this, but that scene when he was trying to understand Tamarian language by talking to the captain. 

It’s something about the main takeaway. “The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hope of communication…, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life”. 
That got to me. It got me on a REAL spiral of thought and I don’t even know why. Such a commitment to peace, to understanding. From someone who was a complete stranger in basically every aspect. That’s so pure and beautiful in a way.

This series is so many good things. It’s beautiful. It’s poetical. It’s artistic and has an incredible way of being relevant and showing us how good we can be as a species. It has changed me. To the better. It has made me look into myself to see what I can change to better as a person. I’m not saying I am perfect example now or something like that. FAR from it. But you better be sure as hell I’ll try to be the best I can from now on. To the people close to me and to every other.

I know this is an unusual post. And trust me, I know it is weird to project so much into fictional characters. But they feel so real to me in a personal level I’m sure some of you out there feels as well. At the times we live in of fear and separation, I cannot stress enough how grateful I am to be reminded of optimism. 

This optimism is powerful. Really powerful. But, most important, it’s moving. It has come to me on a time of such darkness, uncertainty and self-hatred. It is here when I need it most. When I needed to be reminded of how beautiful our world really is and to always keep my head up. Always keep it up. So I won’t miss out on anything.

Sorry for the confusion... It started as a little chat, devolved into opinions on one episode that I liked and now it’s me geeking out about my rekindled hope for myself and for all humanity. We did great things. We still do. And I won’t let some things shatter the hope I have for what’s to come.

Thanks for the existence of this loving community. You guys have better introduced me to all of this and in so, helped me quite a bunch.

And of course, thanks Star Trek. For everything.",I’m so happy right now...

startrek,"This is a spoiler for Enterprise I guess. 

The borg are a classic part of TNG. A key part of their introduction is that we see Q, an all powerful troll, flick enterprise further across the galaxy than anyone has ever gone to encounter an entirely new species unlike anything humanity has ever encountered. Our heroes escape by the skin of their teeth, and The Federation desperately tries, and fails, to prepare for their return. 

So of course Enterprise reveals that the Federation has encountered these guys before. And it’s not one lost ship like in Voyager. Nope. Scientists know about the borg, admirals know about the Borg, and the original earth flagship encountered them at close quarters and even got to hear their catchphrase “resistance is futile.” They also managed to beat them pretty handily with pretty primitive weaponry. Their doctor even managed to cure himself of Borg nanoprobes. 

But I guess no one wrote any of this down? Archer skipped his Captain’s Log on this one? The crew of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D, the cream of the crop and absolute best starfleet has to offer never spent any time reviewing the adventures of their predecessors? Maybe I could buy it if the only encounter with the Borg was in Q-Who, but when they come back in season 3 they make it clear that all of starfleet has been on alert. Not a single person in starfleet, when reviewing the historic threat reported by Captain Picard and his crew, thought “hey I feel like I’ve read about something similar to this?” 

Prequels don’t have to suck. Better Call Saul is currently putting on a clinic other shows should watch on how to deepen the story we’ve already know rather than ruin it. But why most prequels insist on giving people familiar faces to recognize over stories that make sense or complicate what we’ve already seen is beyond me. Crap like this or making Michael Spock’s sister are unforced errors that suck you out of the story while you try to do the narrative gymnastics the writers won’t do for you to make this stuff make sense.

startrek,"I just watched the DS9 episode Second Skin where Kira is kidnapped by cardassians who try to make her believe she is Iliana, the daughter of a Legate who went undercover on Bajor durring the resistance. I remember from previous watch through we never actually learn what really happened to Iliana after she went undercover on Bajor.

Assuming she's alive, that means we're looking for a Bajoran who is in some sort of position of power, or likely to reach one, or someone who is doing harm to Bajor as it is. And then I realised that's basically Kai Winn (who at this point is already Kai). Think about it:

1) Shortly after the withdrawal from Bajor, Winn was a powerful religious head with some support to become the next Kia, and within a year of the withdrawl the old Kai died.

2) She's not exactly the model Vedec/Kai, but would make a great Cardassian. She is regularly seen scheming and attempting to grab power, but always through others in a way that leaves her off the hook when things go wrong. She is manipulative, opportunistic, and power hungry.

3) Spoilers for season 7, but when she does learn that the man she fell in love with and has had assisting her is Dukat and not some Bajoran, she is angry but still carries on with Dukat's plans and sticks with the Pa Wraiths. Now most Bajorans who lived through the occupation would probably have Dukat executed (something the Kai and Minister is certainly able to do with the support of the people), and most would probably reject the path Dukat put Winn on. Perhaps her relatively kind forgiveness of Dukat, and maybe even the initial attraction in the first place, is becouse he is a fellow Cardassian.

Now with the last two points you could say that Iliana's memories would have been erased and replaced with Bajoran memories. However at her core Iliana is still a Cardassian who joined the Obsidian Order out of a sense of duty to the state. At some instinctual level she may still have traditional Cardassian tenancies for espionage and power lust. After all her DNA would still be partially Cardassian (or else Bashir's DNA test of Kira would have meant nothing at the end of this episode).

In the end there's no way to prove it, but I personally like the idea that the woman that Legate, and to a lesser extent Kira herself, were looking for was right under their noses the whole time and still fighting for Cardassia in a very different way to her loving dissident father, and latter on her ""adopted sister"".",Could Winn unknowingly be Cardassian agent Iliana?

Imagin contacting the founders before they settled on their xenophobic plan of galaxy domination, they were the right group of humans to do the job of representing them perhaps they could have averted the entire formation of that toxic world view.

Failing that they could have gathered much needed recon during the lead up of the dominions rise to power.

Failing that they could have collected much needed information on the gamma quadrrant in general. anything to fill in the gaps about that huge unknown region of space would have been helpful.

Failing that dates of travel through the wormhole would have allowed them to send even just the information they already had about the dominion to give them a few years of warning when they came through the wormhole: Gul Dukat will form and alliance, Bashir is a changeling on the station for months etc. etc. 

They really dropped the ball on helping thier civilisation in anyway.

startrek,"I keep hearing folks criticizing voyager and the new shows for not having enough philosophical stuff in them and not being as progressive as some of the other shows. 

This is very strange to me, because as much as I enjoy the philosophical aspects of star trek, I always thought the main attraction of trek were the interactions between the diverse and likeable crew members, its classic discoveries, mishaps, and adventures, and the incredible quality of writing that never disappoints. 

I always assumed that the morality presented in trek was just the result of its premise, that in the post scarcity world of the future, we would have learned to be better than we are now. 

Maybe it's because I got started with voyager and then moved on to ds9, ent, tos, and then finally to tng, but I'm just having trouble comprehending when some people say that trek MUST have some sort of life lesson at the end of each episode. Could you guys help me understand?",Was star trek meant to be political?

I grew up with TOS and TNG, but I didn’t see any of the other series (more than an episode or two at least) until I was an adult. I had decided I wanted to be able to say I’ve watched “all of Star Trek” (I haven’t btw, I did, but then Discovery and Picard aired...). First up I marathoned DS9 and loved it (has been my favorite ever since); then I jumped into Voyager.... after which I watched Enterprise.

Fast forward several years to now, I’ve rewatched everything (DS9 &amp; TNG more than once) except Voyager. Decided to give it another try so I’ve been marathoning it for the past few days, I’m enjoying this runthrough quite a bit. I still feel it could have been better, but that can be said about any show. I think I might have misjudged Voyager... I don’t know if this changes the order I rank the shows in my head, but I most certainly don’t dislike it as much as I thought I did. I would even say I like Neelix more than Wesley Crusher, last week I would have said they were equally annoying. Actually I probably would have given Neelix the shaft, I remember reallllly not liking him the first time around.",Have your feelings about a specific Star Trek show changed over the years?
startrek,"I was thinking about this the other day. Why is it that transporter range is so limited? Applying real life logic and science to a completely made up thing is going to hit some roadblocks pretty quick, but still.  

If you think of transporter pad to arbitrary location transporting, that seems... super impossible, but ignoring that, it makes a lot more sense for that to have a distance limit. 

But if you're talking about transporter pad to transporter pad beaming, it seems like the distance could be almost unlimited. And in cases of common long distance transport, like for example between Earth and Vulcan, it seems like it would be well within the technology as we know it, to built a series of transport repeaters along the way. That way you could beam all the way to other planets. Think a copy of the subspace relay station we've seen on TNG. A small structure that would take inbound transporter signals and relay them to the next station. There is inhabitable space inside so if something happened along the way, you could be materialized on the station instead of trying to be sent back, or being lost in transit.",Long Distance Transporting
startrek,"In the opening sequence to ST:Generations, they are on the Enterprise B. The captain indicates their maiden voyager is just going to be a trip out past Pluto and back. He calls it a quick run around the block.  A reporter asks if they will have time to test the warp engines, suggesting that it's not part of the plan. 

Pluto is 3 billion miles from Earth. A trip there and back is about 6 billion miles. Full impulse is 25% of light speed. So that's approximately 167,654,157 MPH

6,000,000,000 / 167,654,157 = 35.7 hours. Didn't really feel like a day and a half. I guess you could argue that it was going to be a 2 day trip, but it doesn't feel like that's the case. The way the scene is presented, it feels to me like it would be maybe an hour or two. But of course sometimes in trek, you can't go to warp inside a solar system, sometimes you can, so it kind of breaks down at this point. But I feel like they did a much better job of making sure the math added up on TNG than they did in the movies.","""Just a quick run around the block"""

startrek,"I'm not the biggest fan of Nemesis but I just realised how its introduction of the Remans could have actually helped Picard's plot make any damn sense.

The issue you have with Picard is that even if the one planet of Romulus went boom they still have a gigantic STAR EMPIRE. This led to some major headscratching moments. Why can't the Romulans be relocated to anywhere on the hundreds if not thousands of worlds within that empire? Why would they be reluctant to do so? Why are the members of a closely restricted society being let into the rest of the Alpha quadrant? Why are immense resources being spent on other things?

That would all make much more sense if it was the Remans who were refugees because the supernova took out their neighbouring world too.

1. As a small ""cannon fodder"" minority disliked by Romulans, they would probably be refused relocation on other worlds within the Star Empire, mirroring the situation where its often small minority groups that are made refugees.

2. The Romulans have the resources to spend but just don't care and have focused on only helping those on Romulus.

3. As the Remans are an ugly warlike race, it would have a broader message about judging others on appearance.

4. Federation resistance to helping the Remans makes more sense since its not seen as a federation problem and the Remans are known largely for having staged a coup and trying to send a giant death ship to earth.

5. Picard would feel a deeper connection to helping the Remans due to his background with Shinzon and would feel more guilt about letting them down.

Thoughts? I still think this season would have been a mess but at least this would have marginally helped.",Using the Remans as the refugees in Picard would have made much more sense
startrek,"First I want to say I loved Picard. I'm not what of these anti-new trek people. I went through that phase with Enterprise, and I regret it. 

But there is one tiny line that's bothered me, and I have to get it off my chest. It's the data head tilt scene. Isa was a wonderful daughter for Data. She nailed that head tilt. And Riker gave his classic shit eating grin, as a way of saying ""did you guys see that? That was so data!"" It was so beautiful. We saw it, Riker saw it, it was so fucking adorable! Thank you, Isa, for perfectly capturing both Data and Lal *and* bringing your own interpretation to this new character.

And then they ruined it by spelling it out for us. Riker said something like ""I know that head tilt, she is such a data!"" When he said that, The voice of Mr Plinket saying ""they think the audience is stupid"" came into my head. Why? Why can't you just have him say ""I know her. That woman is data, isn't in?""

startrek,"So I read once that the original intentions were for the Excelsior model to be the new Enterprise but the model was really difficult to work with so they went with tried and true Constitution

Assuming that anecdote is true I can’t decide how I would have felt if that had come to pass.

Excelsior blew my mind when I saw it in ST III and I’m pretty sure I would have been thrilled if Voyage Home ended with an Excelsior class ship  named Enterprise-A left Spacedock and Kirk
ended the movie with that “let’s see what she’s got”.

Would Star Trek V has been impacted a lot if that had happened?  Not really but at least the scene where they rocket in the turbolift shaft to deck 74 “might” have made more sense (not really but just being generous) 

Star Trek VI is obviously a bit of a different movie but they certainly could have worked around it.

All in all I’m glad the Constitution refit is the iconic ship of the Original-Series movies and they really didn’t do a ton with the ship where the narrative changes if Enterprise A is an Excelsior so just comes down to that moment at the end of Star Trek IV...

...incredible if they went with the new model but for the legacy of the movies they made the right choice. IMHO

LLAP",What if Enterprise A was Excelsior
startrek,"I hated Discovery, not for it's looks but the plots and actions of the charicters who worked better in the Mirror Universe then the prime one (except Tilly, who most definitely did not).

But, except for 2 slip ups (The Sound of Thunder and being perfectly fine with Emperor Georgiou leading Section 31), Captain Pike was a breath of fresh air and a fantastic captain. Originally I thought I would love a Pike series. But then I realized a Pike series would include Spock, and I instantly fell off it. I \*hated\* the protrayal of Spock in Discovery and think it was domed to fail. Watching season 2 //I thought in order to maintain the Spock we see in TOS he probably couldn't really emotionally make up with Michel. Not only did he do that but he had a complete emotional revelation and basically vowed to embrace his human side. This is a man who has the line ""Ah yes, one of your human emotions"" like 7 years latter! Additionaly I have problems with the portrayal of a Spock who openly laughs out loud in the Short Trek, and even had problems with the idea that he went insane becouse non-linear time existed. ""Time has been the root of all my logic"", I thought the Vulcans got over the whole ""The Vulcan Science Academy yada yada yada Time travel is impossible"" thing 100 years ago? Not to mention coherent logical time travel could exist in many ways, weather possible or not.

Add to that the fact that a Pike series would still likely be lead by the Discovery team, and face the same prequel problems as Discovery with similar writing and do you really want a Pike series anymore? Not to mention what crazy unseen additional upgrades the Enterprise itself would receive. It took Discovery 2 seasons to realize they made a mistake and nope out of being a prequel, and I don't really want to see it happen again. Plus the longer a Pike series went on the more pressure there would be to look like TOS as that 7 year window shrinks with each season.

In breif with the right team a Captain Pike series could be great, but I think there's to much trouble in the past from Discovery, and to many complications from TOS in the future. On top of the complete lack of faith I have for the Discovery writing team, I just think it would do more harm then good at this point, and I want to know what others with similar opinions about discovery think.","If you hated Discovery, do you want a Pike series?"
startrek,"Just finished Heart of Glory as I rewatch the show. A couple things stick out to me:

1. Camera angles are very different from later seasons. Lots more variety, not just on the sets but with the models too

2. The episode scores have so much more personality. Later seasons' music mostly consists of a crescendo during an action scene and before commercials and a little motif after the break. Music early on featured little soundtracks to mini movies.

I think the reason for both is because this is before Berman came on board. He pushed for a homogenized product, with more sterile music and cinematography.",People give the first season of TNG a hard time but there are several positives
startrek,"It was bizzare. We were in a ship shaped like a rocket. If had 6 or 7 floors and each floor was round maybe around 30 feet in diameter if I had to estimate.

It was only me and Garak on that ship/rocket and he was freaking out in the same kind of way when he was freaking out from his claustrophobia and he was ranting excessively and loudly exept I stead of being afraid of closed spaces he was insistent that I was trying to kill him and kept being agressive with me because he thought he was trying to defend himself

I kept trying to reason with him that I had no reason to kill him and also if I did kill him if become completely alone forever (in my dream we were going to live forever and never age on that ship don't ask me why) because he was the only other person there and why would I want that?

Then when he ran to hide in a room from the floor we were in another Garak showed up, it was a copy of him but he was all beaten up. I knew somehow that that copy was coming from his mind as a manifestation so I sent his copy into the room with him for him to deal with it.

Garak was pissed and yelled ""WHY DID YOU SEND HIM HERE?"" And I said ""He's your manifestation so you deal with him"" as I was running upstairs to a higher floor fearing he was gonna chase me and hurt me.

Coming from a guy that's not a fan of TOS, I have to say that it was much better than I remember. I probably won't be owning any of the seasons, but I enjoyed myself. A lot of people characterize this series as corny, but I don't think they give it much credit.

The one who really surprised me was Shatner. I expected him to be especially hammy, but he was actually very well reserved. My favorite character, though, has to be Bones.

The only thing that kept bringing me out of it was the creature effects. I don't expect it to be Jim Henson worthy, but it at least has to be better than Classic Who.

Do those series have endings? I noticed they're each a TON of seasons long, with 20-something episode seasons to boot. If I watch the show all the way to the end, am I given a satisfying conclusion or is it just when the networks decided to end the show?

Is there a list or something fans have made that tells me specifically which episodes to watch that skip some filler or monster of the week episodes?

startrek,"In Star Trek II, in order to take control of some of Reliant's systems, Kirk devises a plan to use the ""prefix code"" to, in 21st century terms, Remote Desktop into the other ship and turn off Shields.msc.  This is very clever and allows for the bloody nose the Enterprise gives the Reliant and allowing them to buy some time.

In Star Trek III, when stealing the Enterprise, the Excelsior is sent to chase.  Whilst not directly said, the plan seems to have been to use a tractor beam to hold the Enterprise in place, and if it tried to out-run the Excelsior, that would be unsuccessful as it has the new Transwarp drive. Captain Styles comments ""If he tries to get away with warp drive, he's really in for a shock.""

Kirk is quite concerned about the Excelsior's advanced speed, and whilst Scotty has done his best to disable the engines, it's not of course guaranteed - ""Scotty, we'll need everything you have.""

Here's the bit that's the missed call back - Whilst I assume Kirk would know to change the Prefix of the Enteprise (given Star Trek II) ahead of time - it'd have been neat to see someone try it on the Enteprise only for it to fail as a result.  

It'd have been the absolutely perfect moment out of any time in Trek to do it - a Federation ship, at headquarters, is being stolen - the systems engineers in Space Dock should be trying to remotely access it to turn off the engines.  

Obviously they either don't or can't because no mention of it is said in the script.  

I just think it would have been a really neat bit of continuity to have it mentioned, and it'd have shown the crew to be quite clever in the process.

startrek,"Narration episodes are when one character frames the plot for viewers by dictating the circumstances going on around them. This usually happens in the form of writing a letter, such as VOY's *Thirty Days* or ENT's *Dear Doctor*. It can happen in other ways though, such as dictating a log to the computer- DS9's *In the Pale Moonlight* is the prime example. These episodes are often a change from the normal pace and offer perspectives we might have heard otherwise and thus are generally favorably received. 

&amp;#x200B;

:- ok so maybe I was being a lil disingenuous in my last log entry, there is one MASSIVE perk to being posted on this mission. Individual, single person quarters for everyone, even the crew people baby! My own quarters with my own bathroom, not sharing a toilet with three other people. I mean ok, it's a wreck right now but when I get a lil time to myself I'll be able to make my perfect cave. Just between us computer, I looked into it and the Bajoran government ain't got no narcotics laws, and since this station is Bajoran property and not Starfleet, I'm totally going to be able to start a weed grow here. I suppose I should address the elephant in the room, the big event I'm sure everyone else is yammering into their logs about. The first stable wormhole ever to be observed by anyone from the known alpha quadrant has appeared in the Denorios belt. Yeah I know, I buried the lead, but what happened next was a lil traumatic for me so I had to warm up to it. The officers decided that they wanted a nice view of the thing from ops so up and moved the station, at what felt like warp factor 9.9 but I have been assured was more like high impulse, right outta orbit with Bajor and up to the belt. Why was this such a traumatic experience? I hear literally no one ask. Its because at the time I was in the service conduits hunting Cardasian Voles for the Cheif. It felt like the inertial dampers failed completely at one point and I slammed my head off a ceiling joist when the deck plating started to separate. I'm sure it was all worth it, I'm sure the commander has a lovely view from his office now. Sorry, I dont mean to be salty, the commander is a good guy, but seriously come on.
In other news I couldn't get the ferengi, his name is Quark, to order any Tennants but I think I've got him to understand the concept of lager, in the meantime, I'm not going to lie, I've picked up a liking for this Cardasian stuff he has called Kanar. Funny stuff, blue or green depending how the light hits it, has a taste not unlike buckfast but a texture more akin to a white Russian.

Not a comfortable ride. Further more this station is falling apart at the seams, you would think an authoritarian regime like the Cardasians would take better care of their equipment, and I know they sabotaged the place on the way out but I'm not even talking about that. The promenade looks like its been hit by a Bolian Hurricane, the replicaters make whatever they please and the sonic shower is either so weak a better job would be done by my grandmother blowing at me, or so powerful you could use it to strip paint.
And joy of joys, the chief has put me in a team hunting for Cardasian booby traps, just me and three other crew people jammed in a service conduit.

startrek,"I hope this finds you all well, even in these troubling times.

I write to you all about something we all, ostensibly, hold dear. 

Star Trek was a saga of unbridled optimism, where a triumphant humanity tried to solve external conflicts through compromise and peaceful mediation if possible. A reality in which the civilized ideal was to be promoted even against the highest odds, and in which it was possible to achieve the moral outcome, even if hard fought over. 

In every episode a world of philosopher kings and poet warriors awaited us, and in every struggle with an alien foe or in every difficult decision made, we learnt more about ourselves and what it is to be human. With each captain from Kirk to Archer, Star Trek grappled with *our* human condition.

This is a requiem I offer regretfully, to the universe that for all its utopianism, reached out a heart-warming hand and beckoned us to a shining world of hope and idealism. 

From its predisposition towards the view screen and inspirational dialogue, to its underpinning ideology of social harmony and progress set against the backdrop of distant space, Star Trek was the equivalent of the choicest Classical Greek poetry combined with the popular tropes of humanist exceptionalism and manifest destiny. 

After somberly watching the last episodes of *Enterprise* it struck me that only though a miracle would I lay eyes upon the same vision, the same metaphysical and physical fabric that had kept me occupied from TOS till now. 

Unfortunately, it seemed that the indomitable 'wheel of time' had struck again, its spokes ever turning, with Roddenberry's legacy a mere footnote in the decision making processes that formed the thinking behind the 'Kelvin' Timeline, *Discovery* and *Picard*.

What happens, in the pursuit of linear progress, if we take a wrong turn? What if we, aesthetically, culturally and ideologically are marching ignorantly down the wrong path? Who is to say that whilst the technological foundations necessary for furthering the Star Trek franchise improve and change, that the core, intrinsic beliefs of the ST universe must change with them? Can we not have one without the other? Why must we subscribe to the view that change is self vindicating? 

The irony abounds, in our reality we suffer the ignoble cruelty of a corrupted linear progress, which has cut us off from one of the few genuine visions of pure progress that has ever graced this earth.

To capture the essence of Star Trek's original aesthetic and ideological message, long forgotten, and to analyses, preserve and work towards its restitution one glorious day. This is my dream.

I envisage a social media network, to promote this platform, and am looking for an experienced team from reddit to first help create a subreddit, and collaborate in each wing of the broader platform. 

Please message me privately, or comment below if you are interested, wish to debate the position, or show your support. What better way to pay homage to our show, than to debate?

There are some really great episodes and seeing the crew discover things that are taken for granted in the 23rd and 24th century (ex. Replicators, new species/cultures we have grown to love) is always fun. Plus every episode with Jeffrey Combs as Shran is a treat.

startrek,"I'm aware that our first glimpse of The Borg Collective is in the TNG episode 'The Neutral Zone' where they've been destroying Federation and Romulan outposts along the border, but I'm talking about more of a 'Best of Both Worlds' or 'First Contact' style attack, where the Borg just gun for the heart of that particular factions civilisation. Is there any example of this for the Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians or even the Ferengi? I'm particularly interested in The Romulans because we know The Borg have at least studied them. Additionally I can pretty easily play out in my mind how the conflict would go with most of the species. The Klingons for example would probably fight valiantly, maybe use their cloaks to their advantage and they would either simply lose, or warp right into the cube when the situation was most dire. I imagine they'd just go for the overwhelm the cube with force and either they'd have so many ships it would whittle them down slowly, or they'd just be eviscerated.


But how the Romulans approach conflict and their philosophy around it makes me wonder how they'd handle a Borg Incursion, I have a few thoughts on the matter and I'm wondering if there's any canon material that explores the idea? If there's any on the Ferengi, I imagine that would also be an entertaining read/watch for different reasons.",Are there canon examples of The Borg making incursions into the space of any of the other main factions?
startrek,"We know that Romulans knew Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant before it happened.

startrek,"I'm making my way through season two of Discovery and got to the Airiam episode. I was disappointed in how ham-fisted it was in setting up Airiam as an amazing person. 

The funeral scene at the start of the next episode sets it up as equivalent to the death of Spock in The Wrath of Khan, but there's just nothing there to warrant that. 

If they had someone other than the main cast eulogize her, to make it appear that she had a different clique that she spent time with, that would be better. If they worked in more interaction over time, such as Airiam helping Tilly with May, I would have believed it more. 

Oh well.",Airiam

This, to me is like being burgled and then buying the burglar acres of land on the other side of the world to do with as he pleases. I completely understand that violence is always a last resort from their perspective and they would never kill unless absolutely necessary, but it just seems a bit redundant to simply let them go.

There’s a flurry of activity as people go to their action stations. And what do these guys do? They take a big step forward. That’s it. They move forward. Their big idea for red alert is to move into the walkway. Another officer actually has to go out of her way to scoot behind one of them and the wall so she can get onto the turbo lift.

So, my question is: how did Reliant and her crew, probably before even entering the system, *not* notice that the system is short one planet? Would there not have been at least a minor asteroid field where CA6 was before? And couldn't they count planets out from the local star and said, ""Nope, that's 5, keep going?""

One defence I'd have for these episodes (except Sub Rosa, that episode should be burned, replicated and then burned again) is that they seem quite tongue-in-cheek and are never meant to be taken seriously, but it's hard to defend an episode that makes you feel like you've just watched Little House on the Prairie in space","Rewatching ""Fair Haven"" (VOY)..."

When I finished VOY awhile back, I wrote a relatively long review on this sub and mentioned that my two favorite characters were easily the Doctor and Seven. Kes, on the other hand, was largely forgettable for me. I was happy when she left, and Seven was such an improvement that I basically forgot about her. 

But going through Season 1 again, I realize that Kes is literally the *only* crew member that treats the Doctor as a person. She asks him for his name, and stands up for him repeatedly to Janeway and the others. Not only does this change the entire trajectory of the Doctor's 'life', **but it also prepares the Doctor to have a similar impact on Seven when she joins the crew.** 

So in effect, my two favorite characters on VOY would have never been even a fraction of what they became without Kes's kindness.

So if we assume she was the only one, he had her dissected to learn about the creature's effect on the brain, and while she was living he learned about how it made her prone to suggestion.  But was she the only one killed by this thing?  Or did he dissect someone else?  Did he use it to torture an insubordinate?

startrek,"TNG Season Five is so good it's ridiculous.  

Obviously this was my favorite show as a kid, but over the years I didn't watch much and I always assumed a big part of what I liked was just nostalgia,  and that maybe I ascribed a little more worth than it deserved.   

But...look at this 4 episode stretch in the middle of season 5: Ethics, Outcast, Cause and Effect, The First Duty.  Thats where I am.  And that's just one stretch.  Darmok, Silicon Avatar, The Game were all earlier.  And looking ahead, theres a stretch with I Borg, The Next Phase,  Inner Light, and Times Arrow.  It's like a TNG greatest hits except they were just all on the same album.  I honestly didn't remember they were all around each other like this.  

As a kid I preferred the action episodes.   ""Are you prepared to die today"" was like, my favorite scene of all time.  But now I'm seeing so many little nuances in ""character"" episodes that I barely liked before.  Like in Ethics, when Worf is coming back to life at the end,  there's a shot of Troi hugging Alexander for like 2 seconds.  And I got choked up at that a little.   

I like how theyve focused away from Picard alot, to focus on others.  It's not ""the Picard Show"" every episode.  Riker, especially,  has had a ton of good development lately.   

Anyway, this is prime Trek, and some of the best TV of all time.",TNG Season 5
startrek," My points per episode this time around are brief.  Not sure why that is.

**Episode 17: Rules of Engagement**

* This felt like *Law &amp; Order: DS9*. Great episode.  
* ""But *I* do not feel like celebrating"" reminds me of ""I am not a merry man.""  If the *Captain Worf* show is ever made, they need to use some of the dialogue from this Sisko-Worf exchange and some other exchanges from TNG.  Good character continuity for Worf. 

**Episode 18: Hard Time**

* Old Man Miles.  20 year virtual prison sentence. Poor Miles. 
* Keiko is such a good wife, covering him up on the floor.  O'Brien has cracked.   Maybe he's experiencing another virtual prison?  That would be awful.
* Killing Ee'char over some hidden food. At that point, I understand his anger. 
* O'Brien's recovery would linger for the rest of a season in today's shows.

**Episode 19: Shattered Mirror**

* Jennifer Sisko is just gonna drop by from the mirror universe?  
* ""I don't trust tall men...""
* Love these Mirror Universe episodes.  I wish *TNG* had done one or two of them.

**Episode 20: The Muse**

* Odo does the most to rescue Momma Troi from her crazy husband. Watching them together is bittersweet.
* Jake is getting his brain energy drained by that strange Onanya lady, but is able to write like he's running out of time...which he probably is considering the nosebleed. 

**Episode 21: For The Cause**

* Kassidy!  Hold up, it's Eddington that I should have kept an eye on!  
* Garak is out here worrying about his life. 
* Poor Sisko, having to turn his girlfriend in. I knew I couldn't trust her.  Glad she wasn't as bad as Eddington though.
* I wonder how much more Maquis stuff is in the show.  This reminds me I need to check how long *Voyager* and this show were on together.  Though, it's only *Pilot/T*he *Caretaker* episode w/ the Badlands and Maquis that really crossover.

**Episode 22: To The Death**

* The Jem'Hadar are back! 
* Also LeVar Burton is behind the camera!  That's probably why the episode opened with prone juice. More Worf continuity.  Maybe the closing shot of the *Captain Worf*  show is his him drinking prune juice, or maybe he orders it like Picard orders Earl Grey on *TNG* (I haven't watched *Picard* yet, but I would be surprised if he didn't get at least one cup in).
* Good setup to have Starfleet and the Jem'Hadar working together.

**Episode 23: Body Parts**

* Quark goes dark and the O’Brien’s baby.
* Hilarious episode. Value life more than rules. 
* The looks among Keiko, Miles, and Nerys was a great bit of acting (when they ask Kira to move in, revealed later in the episode).  

**Episode 24: Broken Link**

* Odo spasming out is sold well by Rene.  
* Good to see Kira is still pregnant.  
* Worf asking about Curzon is funny too.  
* They couldn’t put Odo on a gurney? Too much pride, Odo.  
* The Founders made Odo sick. Interesting. 
* Good to see the Great Link come back. 
* Garak discovers the beef between the Founders and the Cardassians.
*  I'm guessing this sets up a Founder/Dominion Cardassia invasion later.  
* Garak is about trading lives, ""a little genocide in the name of self defense.""
* They made Odo a SOLID?!?  Didn't see that coming. I guess no more shape shifting for him, he gets to sleep like a normal humanoid now. Great character development for Odo.

Great finale!  Is the real Gowron dead?  Season 5 will tell.","DS9 First Watch: Season 4, Episodes 17 - 26"
startrek,"I started watching TOS five months ago and  now I am a few episodes away from ending TNG. I ask this because... I didn't like TNG, or at least I didn't think it was better than TOS. Just to name a few things I didn't like:

Data is an excellent secondary character, but the episodes with him as the protagonist (and all his arc) seemed very boring to me.

Worf must be the worst-handled character in the series. Every time he gave a recommendation as head of security, someone else said that it wouldn't work. On the other hand, the episodes with Worf as the protagonist seemed to me the best.

All seasons have 5 or 6 episodes exactly the same: something to solve in the holodeck (worst of the series imo), a crew member returns to the Enterprise after a short trip and the rest crew appears to be changed, Picard leaves the Enterprise on some mission and ends up lost on some uninhabited planet, and so on.

But what I like least compared to TOS is that they do not respect the motto of the series: *to seek out new life and new civilizations*: one episode, hopefully two, of each season, were about making contact with new civilizations. And that sucks.

My friends recommend DS9, which they tell me is more serial and not so episodic. I am thinking of jumping directly to Discovery. What do you recommend me?",Whats next?
startrek,"I was rewatching SFDebris' review of The Final Frontier. He mentions that its unusual that Sybok, a person who seeks God, would not have a dialogue with Spock about his death and resurrection. For one who seeks God would want to speak to such a person. Fair point. But I wonder, exactly how much knowledge about that event is actually made public. Like, would Sybok even know that Spock was dead in the first place? Because would't information about a Starfleet Captain being killed be a 20th century genetic superman with a weapon of mass destruction, funded by the government, and the Captain's said resurrection be something that Starfleet would classify? Like I don't see how Sybok would even know that and thus would be an unfair criticism of the film.

Further, exactly how much information is the Federation public actually allowed to know. Because I can't imagine a FNN broadcast going like this:

""Good evening. In tonight's top story, the son of famed Starfleet Captain James T. Kirk has been killed by Klingons. This was after the Klingons discovered that the Federation was secretly constructing weapons of mass destruction. And this only after a genetically engineered Human from the 20th century stole the weapon using a stolen Federation starship. Further, Starfleet Captain Spock was killed only to be later resurrected by this weapon and a secret ceremony held on Vulcan. More details at 11. And tomorrow we'll discuss how two humped-back whales from the 20th are doing here after Starfleet uses time travel to retrieve them.""

Yeah... I can't imagine that your average Federation citizen would know much about what we, the audience, knows. Anyone have any thoughts on what the Federation and Starfleet tells it's citizens?",Federation Public Knowledge
startrek,"When I watch a Next Generation episode, and it makes me want to put my head through the screen, I don't get anything out of the episode.  TNG typically revolves around a plot or the story being told while DS9 was written around the character's development.  This means even in the misses like ""Move Along Home,"" you may not enjoy the plot, but you explore the characters and learn more about them.  For example, you see Quark's greediness and willingness to rip off the Watti, but you also learn he has a conscious.  You also get to see every senior officer's reaction to being put in an unfamiliar situation.  Kira tries to bluster her way through, Dax is intrigued and approaches with a scientific mindset, Sisko is calm and methodical, Bashir is willing to take a backseat as they don't need his expertise while also offering advice occasionally, and Odo is unsure how to act because it is one of the few times he can't do anything to help.  Overall, I think the character-driven plots in DS9 can help make up for stupid or poorly executed ideas in a way TNG can't.  Thoughts?",The difference between bad DS9 episodes and TNG episodes is that the DS9 episodes are largely watchable.
startrek,"A thought’s been rolling around my brain for a while - could the D- series designations be classifications not classes?

The TOS D-7 and K’t’inga are effectively identical. And there’s the D-7 (Sech-class) prison ship Lorca was on.

Could D-7, instead, designate battlecruiser, like how the 1701 is a heavy cruiser?

And the Duras sisters’ bird-of-prey being D-12 could indicate “heavy attack ship”. Worf cited it as a D-12 because the whole classification of D-12 BOPs were retired - they had only been retired since the late 2340s/early 2350s, so they were a recent-ish design of BOP.

Maybe the classic B’Rel’s were, say, D-10 (“light attack ship”), for example.

startrek,"When I was a kid, there was a TV show I used to really like. It was about a kid who had super powers and his nerdy scientist friend who helped him learn to control his powers and use them to fight crime.

I used to love that scientist. Not so much the kid, but then again, I never liked Wesley, either. But the scientist... him I wanted to be my own personal science buddy to help me become a superhero.

I have been trying to figure out what that show is for years. I was just telling a friend about it the other day, and about my fruitless search. I had just finished showing him Deep Space Nine, and decided to show him Voyager.

Somehow, I was able to spot my old pal through crewman Chell's thick prosthetics, blue makeup, and lack of glasses. Thanks to IMDB, the rest of my questions have been answered. Sooo, Star Trek has essentially helped me perform an act of bibliomancy. It's like the I Ching of sci-fi.

startrek,"I think one of the things that disappoints me most about Discovery and Picard is the use of profanity. I wish I were able to share these shows with my children — do you remember being a kid and watching Star Trek, how cool that was? — but I don’t expose them to shows that use profanity. And it’s just not needed: if you need to rely on cursing to convey strong emotion, you’re just not a very good writer. 

I know, I’m a prude. Go ahead and tell me how wrong I am, but I just wanted to speak my peace.",Profanity
startrek,"I never really watched Enterprise much when it was on the air because I was kind of Trekked out at that point and the notion of a prequel just didn’t turn me on. But I’m watching it on Netflix not and I really like the show a lot more than I remember. When it came out I wasn’t particularly thrilled mainly because I love worldbuilding episodes that push the limits with new tech like trans warp and strange new species. But it’s just a damn good show and I feel like a jerk for not giving it enough of a chance when I was younger. 

First off, it has one of the most likable crews of any Star Trek. Scott Bakula is one of my favorite TV sci fi actors (ho boy!) and makes a very convincing captain I would be as honored to serve under as JLP (the best captain ever period, unlike that reckless retard Kirk). But the whole crew has great chemistry on par with TNG yet they also have this emotion, inexperience and human-ness that really captures the first swim in ocean feel of the show compared with the TNG crew, who always feel like minor gods who always do the right thing. It’s also just something fresh to see humanity so weak and vulnerable in a world where I’m used to seeing them as one of the most dominant species of the alpha quadrant. Plus, the Vulcans are my favorite species and this show has them in spades, as condescending and logical as ever. Oh, and the show intro gives me tingles every time I see it. 

Just saying, people seem to look at it as the failed Star Trek series because it only lasted 4 seasons, but I think the quality is better than Voyager or DS9 (not to knock those shows, Voyager was actually the series that got me into Star Trek and I think its concept is fantastic). It really reminds me why I like Star Trek so much in the first place. It’s just a world I would love to exist in, full of philosophy and ideas and supremely nerdy wonderfulness. And it turns out you can expand the world building in interesting ways with a prequel by explaining all kinds of origin stuff.",CMV: Enterprise was one of the best Star Trek series.
startrek,"\- First off, I think I appreciate it a lot more than I did in the past.  Folks have been posting about how ""its not really that bad"" and its true.  I think what threw me off as a kid when it aired, is that it tackled topics I wasn't interested in at the time. 

\- Also, I was guilty of following the first rule of new Trek shows: Hate it because its not like the Trek show you are nostalgic for.

\- I used to tell people to start at Season 3, then watch the first two after you finish the last season- but now I don't know.  

\- There is an episode where Morn LAUGHS.  Audibly!

\- ""Storyteller"" (episode 13) is REALLY bad.  Like a REAL stinker.  I was ready for ""Move Along Home"" - but I think we often overlook how bad this episode is.  Like....I think it MIGHT be worse than ""Move Along Home"" - as we don't even get an Allamaraine!

\- I like playing this game in Trek, I like to note the lengths the writers go through to make sure extras and other characters never speak.  In DS9 we all know of Morn (WHO LAUGHED!) - but in Episode 14, ""Progress,"" there are two side characters who can't speak because ""the Cardassians saw to that"".  Clever.

\- In that same episode- I think we see the precursor to Riker's pizza oven.",Some random thoughts re-watching DS9 Season 1
startrek,"A couple of days ago I made a post on here, asking people how I should approach watching Star Trek for the first time and what series to start with. Most people recommended either TNG or TOS, and since I'm a purist about watching it in order of publication with Star Wars myself, I decided to start with TOS. I just finished the first season and I thought I'd update you all and tell you how I feel about Star Trek now.

During the first couple of episodes I honestly had problems really getting into it, one of my biggest problems was the gender roles. Of course I know that from the perspective of a person from the 60s it was incredibly progressive, but today episodes like ""Mudd's Women"" just feel very... outdated. I still don't really like the way that emotions are portrayed in men vs. women: like in ""Shore Leave"", when McCoy died and Kirk just looked sort of... disappointed while McCoy's fling who he barely even really knew started crying very dramatically. Please just let your male characters show emotion, they're just not relatable otherwise. Ironically, one example where I think this is done really well is Spock. There's a reasonable explanation for why he doesn't show emotions, but we're still told pretty subtly that he has emotions that he represses along with his human side. I think a lot of it is down to Leonard Nimoy's acting, he manages to portray perfectly the normal stoic Spock, but also very subtle emotional changes during high-stakes scenes (particularly when Kirk is in danger). Also very ironically, I'm prdtty sure he's the only recurring male character who's cried onscreen.

After a few episodes, I actually decided to only watch the best episodes of the show and then move on to TNG, so I watched ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" which actually managed to change my entire view on TOS. I loved the premise, the character development and the interesting moral dilemma (the idea of Edith being right but at the wrong time, causing the Nazis to win was fascinating). The comedy in that episode also played a huge role in getting me into the show, the dynamic between Kirk, Spock &amp; Bones is amazing and literally funnier than most comedy shows on TV nowadays. 

That episode basically singlehandedly converted me and I decided to watch all of TOS after all and I have to say, I absolutely get why people are obsessed with Star Trek. Just the idea of a peaceful future without racism where we explore the universe brings happy tears to my eyes, and that idea must have been especially impactful in the 60s. I love all of the characters (can we talk about how amazing Uhura is?), but my favourite is definitely Spock. Just the idea of him having been raised to repress his human side and struggling to find his identity is amazing. I love how, even though he tries so hard to be completely Vulcan, he clearly has so many human characteristics even if they're a little toned down, and I love that even though he appears to think of humanity as inferior, ultimately he still made the choice to join the Starfleet and be surrounded by humans instead of staying on Vulcan. His friendship with Kirk is amazing, I feel like Kirk is really the only one who fully accepts both his Human and his Vulcan side. It took me a while to start to like Kirk because he just seemed to much like the stereotypical cocky male hero, but I learned to appreciate him through his relationships with Spock and McCoy and his strong moral compass.

Of course it's a very old show and it's always very obvious they're just in a studio and not actually on an alien planet, and the fighting is clunky to say the least (it literally just looks like a weird hug sometimes, and other times Kirk just hits someone with his hand and they're unconscious, what the hell?), but the ideas and messages behind it are so well articulated and still relevant that the bad special effects barely matter anymore. I absolutely understand people's love for this show now. Star Wars feels like a magical fairytale in a far away world, but the people in Star Trek are from our own future which connects it to the viewer beautifully. I love the idea that my great great great grandkids could work on a spaceship like the Enterprise.

Anyway, thanks for reading this! I appreciate it! :)",Update: Watching Star Trek for the first time
startrek,"Just finished Star Trek TNG for the first time. It was the first Star Trek series I watched, besides Discovery, due to having the prejudice that old Star Trek series were only made for hardcore nerds.

After becoming intrigued, I gave it a go and found myself hooked and inspired by nearly every episode. The series was so far ahead of it's time, I still feel it is and it may always be. Season 7 was not as good as the others but damn, I still enjoyed every single episode. I can only imagine what a gutting feeling it must have been watching the credits of that final episode, not knowing if you would ever again see anything like that. Luckily I know now that there is a lot of similar content available, but the pain is still very real. In a moment of overwhelming grief, I even stood up and saluted Captain Picard as the final credits rolled, for nobody to see in my empty apartment. 

Go ahead laugh at me, I don't give a f***.

I wonder if any of the later series will be on the same level as this masterpiece, which I now regard as one of the top 5 series I ever saw, coming second to only The Sopranos. It is applaudable how it held up against time and how it's fascination is completely independent of the old special effects. Actually I even think it might have had an impact on me deciding to go back to school to do my PhD next Semester.

startrek,"Due process was pretty lacking. Kirk did not have time to build a defense and was asked to give a statement on the fly, with the entire academy present. It was only by sheer luck that the Nero crisis delayed the hearing.

I feel like the Starfleet after the timeline changed was quite different from the prime Starfleet. A good juxtaposition is the TNG episode First Duty, where the training accident was given a very procedural hearing. The cadets could actually plan their defense and the damning cross-examination was given only after the cadets had their full opportunity to present their case.",Did anyone else (besides Kirk) have a problem with the SURPRISE hearing on academic misconduct with the entire Academy students and administration present?

Quite literally every single day on this sub there's multiple posts where someone mentions PIC, VOY, or DIS in passing and someone immediately has to latch on and try to start a flamewar by ignoring the flow of the conversation and instead going with ""actually this thing you like is dogshit"" or ""actually *you're* dogshit for not liking this thing"". It's honestly just irritating at this point; if a thread is clearly for critiquing a show, nobody needs to show up to defend it. If a thread is for celebrating a show, nobody needs to piss on the parade.

I can pretty easily provide dozens of examples of this but I'm pretty sure everyone's seen it. It's only gotten worse in the wake of Picard S1 and it's downright tiring. At this point it feels like two-bit trolling.",Request for the mods: could we try out a rule against randomly bringing up why you hate or love a series in a thread about people doing the opposite just to be inflammatory?
startrek,"For this post, I'm going to focus on a few of the things I liked about St Picard.

First of all, the Enterprise-D in the opening scene of the first episode. Wow. It looks EXACTLY the SAME as it did! Not a single difference. No silly stupid unneccessary upgrading of the looks or the technology. It's like they respected the continuity or something. Amazing. I couldn't believe it. I was in awe that they stayed faithful. It was surreal. See Paramount/CBS? That wasn't so difficult now was it?

Not to mention the TNG uniforms and comm badges. Damn, I was losing my shit when I saw how they stayed the same too. And in the season finale when Picard met Data in the quantum memory bank or whatever and Data was wearing the exact same clothes he was wearing when he died in Nemesis. It's like the series is a faithful sequel or something. Unbelievable.

And the new Starfleet comm badges. That wasn't their first appearance by the way. They appeared in DS9's ""The Visitor"" in the future when Jake was trying to save Ben Sisko from the dimension he got stuck in or whatever. So ST Picard stayed faithful in that respect too.

While this first season wasn't the greatest Star Trek series, the continuity and consistency with established canon was such a relief and bodes well for the future. Forgive me for ranting but Star Trek has been seriously pissing me the fuck off since 2009 with all these pretentious unneccessary juvenile changes and retcons.

Rant over. Phew. I'll get back to work now.",What I love about Star Trek Picard: the continuity
startrek,"This might upset some people but it also upsets me. Let's apply this to the real world.

The Cardassian Union was like the German Democratic Republic, and the Obsidian Order were like the Stazi. Garak being a former officer of the Order tortured many people, including innocents, and may have even killed several people.

And just like the reunified Germany, the new Cardassia, in its efforts to reform itself and exorcise the ghosts of its past, will want to hold members of the former regime to account for their crimes. No democratic reform is complete without achieving justice for the victims and casualties of the previous oppressive regime.

There are many other real world examples of this.

I'm afraid many of Garak's surviving victims, their relatives and relatives of deceased victims wouldn't be happy at all about a former Obsidian Order officer working in the new civilian government trying to rebuild Cardassia. It would leave a bitter taste in their mouths and would tarnish Cardassia's efforts to turn a new page for itself.

Garak's redemption at the end of DS9 would not be complete without him owning up to his past crimes and turning himself in, pleading guilty, confessing all the heinous things he did and revealing the names and identities of other operatives, as well as other figures of the former regime, so that they could be brought to justice too.

startrek,"So i've just watched the episode. We'll call John de Lanci Q, and Gerrit Graham Quinn.

Quinn is seeking asylum to the federation from the continuum. The hearing essentially gets framed around the idea of granting him asylum and thus enabling his suicide, or refusing to aid him and send him back to prison.

Now, i'm just getting off the end of Picard and The Good Place, so i immediately think, he should be allowed to die. And immortal life is not living. The beauty of life is that it has an end.

Q's tactics for arguing against asylum are interesting though. First he points out that no one in the continuum has ever done it, so they can't be sure of the consequences. And i think that is very telling and foreshadowing of the status of the continuum. Quinn is not allowed to kill himself because no one has done it. Because they never do anything new. They are immortal and have all of time to do what they want, so they do nothing. They are a completely stagnant society.

Q later brings up the notion that Quinn shouldn't be allowed to kill himself because he's had such a great impact on the universe. That is an interesting angle, because his life in the past was important and influential, he must be forced to live and possibly do more great and important things. It is the same argument as saying that someone who's lived an unremarkable life should be allowed to kill themselves. It is an interesting way of quantifying the worth of a human life, and who has freedom over their own choices and who doesn't.

I am not sure i agree with Q's argument. I think Quinn should have absolutely been allowed from the start to have the choice to kill himself. I realize that is how the episode ends. But i think it should have been a celebration. The captain should not look at it as aiding someone do harm, but rather share in someone's ability to live their life to the fullest.","VOY ""Death Wish"""

This episode involves Worf, Dax, and Kor recovering the lost sword of the ancient hero Kahless from a Hur’q ruin. All fine. There’s some Klingon mysticism, a battle, there’s even a Lethian mind taker. 

After the whole adventure, they proceed to chuck the sacred and irreplaceable Batleth out of the shuttle? A few scenes earlier Worf and Kor were worshiping the thing. It seems like an incredibly irresponsible and sacrilegious thing to do.

startrek,"New trek is great television. There is no denying it’s capacity to entertain. Some of us however I think, and I may be wrong, found something more in trek. Hope, that we are enough, and our faults can be overcome, Inspiration. I think there is a reason why broken people, who feel cast aside by society find so much joy in it. Why we nerds, and geeks, and outsiders become so attached. Trek used to be an escape that we could go to, a haven where everyone despite their differences and short comings could come together and solve a problem every week. That ride gave us so much hope. It made me feel that there was beauty in the world, and if it i couldn’t find the beauty I could see the potential. At least this is what drew me to it, and why it’s precious to me. New trek is great television. It just doesn’t make me feel that potential hope for the future. Sure TNG, and voyager, and even DS9 can be in your face with its sentimentality and sappiness. But when the world sucks that’s where I go. Because old trek is like medicine. New trek just doesn’t do that. It’s good television. But just like some books change your life and others are great fun, there’s a difference. I need those Picard speeches sometimes. I relate to data’s struggle because I know what it’s like to be on the outside trying desperately to be on the inside. I feel Geordie being awkward with awkward and unsuccessful with dating.

startrek,"Long time lurker here, but never posted - I'm old enough to have seen this episode at first airing, and then subsequently over the years.  Each time I saw it anew, something really nagged at me about this otherwise great episode.

Unless I've made some poor reasoning here, I would have to believe that an intact and functional space vessel from the 20th Century, never mind *actual living humans* from 20th Century Earth, would be a pretty incredible discovery in the 24th Century.  Yet from the beginning, Riker and later Picard seemed annoyed having these people around - in fact, Riker had to be persuaded to even let them come aboard the Enterprise, and Picard seemed annoyed that Crusher brought them back from the dead.  Later, everyone warms to them a little, but it never seems like anyone is astounded by the rarity of this discovery.  

I've always felt like this was the show's writers expressing a sort of contempt for their own 20th Century contemporaries, an understandable bit of prejudice - but also very sloppy and indulgent to let those feelings manifest in the writing in a way that doesn't seem plausible.  Picard especially, as an archaeologist and historian, would surely have been (correctly) thrilled by this discovery.

That the Enterprise was involved in an unpleasant mission featuring the Romulans doesn't fully explain away the initial resistance to bringing the people aboard or studying their vessel, or Picard's out-of-character reaction to the discovery.

Am I wrong on this?","Something that's always bothered me about TNG 1.25 ""The Neutral Zone"""
startrek,"Hi everyone,

Sorry for asking what is probably a pretty common question. I have failed to find an exactly satisfactory question/answer for this unfortunately, so I have come for help. Myself and a few friends have been doing a virtual movie club where we rotate who chooses the next movie to watch and discuss. We have been checking off some classics, and since our last movie (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) ended up being a hit, I thought it would be fun to dive into some Star Trek since none of us are familiar with it, but generally know of its importance.

I have determined that Wrath of Khan should be watchable for us, even without having seen any Star Trek before. However I have seen some opinions that WoK is made better by having familiarity with the show and the relationships between some of the characters, particularly between Kirk and Spock. I also know that the movie spawns from an episode in the original series. In order to offer a fuller effect (I know it won't be the same as watching the entire series), I want to recommend just a few *optional* episodes of ToS to the group for interested folks to become a bit more familiar with the show and its characters. 

Can you help me to choose just three or four strong episodes that could be a good introduction to the crew and serve as a primer for knowing the relationship between Kirk and Spock better? That is the main thing, I guess - if there are key episodes that flesh out important characters in the movie, I think those might be the best crash course in Star Trek to hopefully find more enjoyment in WoK.

&amp;#x200B;

 I just watched the Space Seed episode to see the introduction of Khan, and actually enjoyed it much more than I expected (maybe I'll become a big fan through all of this), and I think I might include that one on my list even though it doesn't do anything major with the Enterprise characters. Even with just that one episode I got some sense of the weirdness of Spok's lack of emotions, the small annoyance that the doctor feels at Spok for being that way, and the sly cunning of Kirk. I bet that some particular episodes could highlight that stuff even better though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!","It is my turn to choose for quarantine movie club, and I am picking Star Trek II: WoK. What few episodes should I recommend as ""optional viewing""?"
startrek,"What will your new Trek series look like? What will it be about? When will it be set? Who are your actors and characters? What themes would you want to cover? Be as brief or as detailed as you like.

My series would start in the year 2400 with a new Enterprise-F (not going to consider ST Online canon, sorry), with a new captain and a new crew going off on new voyages to explore uncharted space in the Milky Way galaxy.

I want it set in 2400 because I want the new-ish feel of the ""25th century"" and I'd also want the door open for characters from previous series to make an appearance or even become main characters. I'd like the opportunity for appearances by Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov too. Don't humans live to 200 years on average in the Federation?

I'd also want white anglo actors to be a minority in the main cast. I'd hold casting calls in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia so the Enterprise, Starfleet, and the Federation have a truly international feel to them. I think this would grow Star Trek's global appeal and be much more accurate in how an actual Starfleet would look. A minority of Earth's population are white and come from the USA/UK so it only makes sense.

Oh and the Enterprise will be a completely new kind of ship. Completely sustainable and carbon neutral equipped with regenerative crystals that are recharged by the most abundant energy source in the galaxy: stars. Everyone once in a while, the Enterprise will just have to make a pit stop by a star to recharge. The entire exterior can absorb solar energy.

Themes to explore:

Mental health (depression, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, PTSD). The Dominion War is still fresh in the memory of many Starfleet personnel.  
Refugees and immigration (Starfleet and the Enterprise are home to many Cardassian, Romulan, and Klingon refugees fleeing war, poverty, and persecution and now building new lives for themselves. Would create for interesting drama and social commentary).  
The need for Starfleet to continue its peaceful mission of exploration but to also remain vigilant and ready for combat so that the Dominion War never happens again, especially now that there's a power vacuum in Romulan space. The new Enterprise-F is armed to the teeth and even houses an on-board barracks for an entire regiment of Starfleet infantry. Lots of ethical issues to explore there.  
Gender and sexuality (masculinity would be interesting to explore).  
Privilege and inequality

startrek,"Or rather, why is everyone in the universe so stupid that they take the idea Vulcan's can't lie as admissible in court? You hear this every episode where a Vulcan has more than five lines, but in the same episode there will almost always be a little side-joke where that same Vulcan bends the truth. Spock is famous for this.

A more truthful statement might be ""Vulcans **don't** lie,"" not ""Vulcan's *can't* lie."" Vulcans don't lie (often) because it is, in their assessment, illogical. Vulcans aren't logical by nature, and their logic is in fact the result of centuries of defiance of their baser natures. They can therefore lie just as easily as they can be illogical, which they also tend to do with some regularity.

Tuvok points out to Chakotay in an early episode of Voyager that he was able to lie about being a Maquis because he was ""honest to {his} own convictions within the defined parameters of {his} mission."" This seems to indicate that he could compartmentalize his mind, essentially lying to himself and making the lie true. If he can do that, any Vulcan with a third-grade logic certificate could probably also do the same, effectively making it so the truth is ANY Vulcan could be lying to you at ANY time about ANY thing, or possibly EVERY Vulcan EVERY time about EVERYTHING.

In theory, the Vulcans could all be insane.

startrek,"Starfleet built the Defiant to explore strange new worlds, discover the unknown, and advance the cause of peace and learning in the galaxy. 

Instead her crew were lured into interphasic space by the Tholians, went insane, murdered each other, and then the Defiant was captured by the Terran Empire a hundred years in the past. 

From there the Terrans, weeks away from losing a war with a group of allied species resembling the Federation, ended up crushing their enemies with her future technology and established total dominance for over a century with overwhelming technological superiority. 

This is a disaster that I don't think gets emphasized enough. Billions of people across the mirror Alpha Quadrant were oppressed for generations because of the edge the Defiant gave the Terrans. Entire worlds were devastated throughout multiple Terran genocides.

It’s also possible that Archer’s NX-01 Enterprise wasn’t part of the Prime Timeline’s history until Star Trek: First Contact altered it.
Cochrane’s knowledge of the Enterprise E could’ve contributed to the existence of the NX-01 in the timeline.

There’s also small things like Scotty giving away the formula for translucent aluminum in The Voyage Home, Data leaving his device in 1893, and etc that might’ve caused the prime timeline to advance earlier, delay the Eugenics War/ WWIII, make Khan a white British dude, and etc.

startrek,"I’m sure there’s at least one more episode with Eddington where he escapes again or something because this ended a bit too...easily, not dramatic enough for the relationship they have so I just want to gauge the feelings on his actions up until this point in time. 

Now I will say Sisko is definitely obsessed with Eddington, at first mostly just because Eddington got the upper hand and got away with it. Eddington 100% betrayed Starfleet and used his position to help out the Maquis and give false info on them to Sisko, or false enough to fool everyone without raising suspicions. At first before this particular episode I was kinda with Eddington in regards to Sisko that they hadn’t done anything too terrible that concerned the Federation and Siskos need to catch him wasn’t a huge priority. Fortunately the episodes were spread out far enough that when Eddington did pop up it was likely months in between where other things have happened so it made sense. 

However while I don’t condone what Sisko did in torpedoing the planet I do agree with his argument that the Maquis made themselves a bigger target when they got and used biogenic weapons. And successfully attacked an Excelsior class starship. I don’t think Starfleet would have agreed with the end product but I do think they would have increased patrols and ships near the DMZ to track down the Maquis. 

I honestly don’t know where I go with feelings. I agree with the argument but the action seems too ruthless, and Sisko didn’t care if the people were evacuating or not so he fully intended on killing those people just to get to Eddington.

startrek,"Writing this as I rewatch key episodes (mostly those where crewman Cutler is involved), so this might be incomplete. Right now I’m watching Episode 13 Sleeping Dogs. 

The scenes wherein Lt. Reed’s cold reminds me of our current pandemic reality. I think the one that takes the blow is the episode prior to this—Season 1 Episode 12 Dear Doctor. 

Dear Doctor presents a medical drama about misguided compassion and universe natural course, narratively tied by the conversations between two medical professionals. 

Aside from the widely discussed ethical dilemna on the hypocratic oath and natural selection, which will become the guiding foundations of THE (prime) directive. I think the episodes become more relevant given our current predicament and the ethical choices the global community is facing.

One controversial and ethical dilemna would be on the topic of ‘Herd Immunity’ going about mostly in the western hemisphere. The logic of this is simple, let nature takes it course and those who are ‘fit’ would develop natural immunities.

I do not agree to this logic. I believe there is a far better option for us and it start not by demarcating the ‘new normal’ (like social distancing and paronia level approaches) but by abolishing the old and restructing society to become more humane and sufficient. 

In this example we are the Valakians. A dominant species bent on controlling nature. But nature is not meant to be controlled and exploited. Same with the sentiments of crewman Cutler, we should find the old ways—consumerism,exploitation, wars and the like—distateful and we should set forth the ideal for a more humane and ecological. 

The virus may be nature’s design but we can surpass this if we live by the land and let ourselves learn from nature.

Unlike the Valakians there is hope for us,afterall, this disease is not genetic but more viral. Our species is not doomed but we must all cooperate for the betterment of all. There will be no warp capable starships bringing salvation but there is hope among ourselves to surpass this challenge.

startrek,"I personally like them. Their much more alien-like appearance and non-human facial features sells their alien origins much better than ""classic Klingons"" ever did. I also appreciate their much more pronounced hierarchical social order, as well as the much more brutal tactics they employ against their enemies, such as torturing them and even eating slain Starfleet captains. Klingons in older treks merely implied they were capable of  brutalities in the furtherance of Klingon interests and in preservation of their honor, but rarely followed through on their intentions. They usually just growled or protested verbally when they were insulted.

To put it succinctly, I think Discovery era Klingons are less talk and much more action. They stay true to their brutal culture and don't hesitate to employ vicious fear tactics against their enemies and amongst themselves. It's a much less romanticized depiction of Klingon culture, and I think it's an interesting and valuable perspective on the species.

\- Space rts/roguelike (like *FTL: Faster Than Light*)

\- Narrative games with multiple paths affected by player choices (like the old episodic Telltale games, or the *Mass Effect* series)

\- A management/development game where you take command of a space station in a remote, dangerous area and try to run and improve it.

If it’s the distortion that led them to the Sphere in the first place then I have to ask when Michael goes back in time to create the distortions wouldn’t she have been better off not leading them to it? The Sphere is the entire reason she has to go back in time as it takes over Control and turns it into a Terminator, so by not leading them to it that should save everyone. It gave some knowledge on ancient Kelpiens sure but otherwise it’s not used for much, again I’m sorry if I’m remembering wrong but I don’t remember it helping much. Yes it’s a plethora of knowledge but is that worth the cost?

That’s of course assuming the assumption it was Michael. If the Sphere itself actually pulled them in then couldn’t Michael also have tried to lead them away from it or set a distortion at some other sector at the same time Discovery was heading towards the Sphere? 
I know there’s a lot of behind the scenes things that the show runners wanted to do, I think I heard they wanted to send Disco way into the future when they got back from the mirror universe idk if that’s true or not, and of course because of Control Discovery had to go to the future to save everyone and make it make sense in terms of the show universe as a whole but still.",The Sphere in Disco.

startrek,"So after quarantine began, my dad introduced me to Star Trek in order to “complete my nerd training”. He started with TNG because he thought it would capture my attention more than TOS, however we *did* watch TOS movies. So I thought I’d share my ranking/opinions of them. I know this has probably been done a thousand times before, but I just really want to talk about it with someone and I’m new to the community. Also, again, please no spoilers! I’ve only watched TOS movies and the first season of TNG so far, so don’t spoil anything else.

So here’s my **personal** ranking of the Original Series films, from least favorite to favorite:

6. Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I feel like this movie took itself too seriously, and just didn’t have enough action. The characters also didn’t get much time to shine, and I didn’t feel like I really knew them after watching it. It still had moments, and it’s not a *bad* movie, just not my favorite.

5. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. So from other articles I’ve been reading, I think this seems to be people’s least favorite. It’s still not an incredible film, but I like a lot of things about it better than one. It’s more fun, with more action and more focus on the characters. The camping scenes were also great.

4. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. I know this movie is well-loved so don’t attack me haha. While I haven’t watched the rest of TOS, I did watch “Space Seed” to prepare for this movie. I think the idea of bringing a one-off villain back and making him the main villain seeking revenge is super cool, and the end of the movie is amazing. Though I haven’t watched the show yet, Spock’s death destroyed me. I mean, come on! It’s *Spock*! He’s iconic. I just don’t see why everyone else seems to think this movie is the best, though. Maybe I’m just missing something, idk. But I just don’t love it as much as everyone else seems to. Still a fantastic movie.

3. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. I originally couldn’t pick between this and Star Trek III, but ended up putting III above this. This movie is just so fun and action-packed! I also love the whole “who dun it” plot style. That said, I totally figured out that the rando Vulcan lady was part of the conspiracy from the get-go. It was pretty obvious that she was sus.

2. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. This movie was just really great. Emotional, entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat. I was sad to see David go so soon though. I wanted to see him and Kirk’s relationship develop. But the reunion between Spock and the rest of the crew was beautiful.

1. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. So let me preface this by saying that I have cetaphobia...fear of whales. So naturally, when I realized that the probe was trying to contact a species of animals, I turned to my dad and said, “They’re trying to contact a freaking **whale**, aren’t they?!?!” I was a little skeptical from that point on, but my dad ensured me that I would love it. He was right. I did have to cover my eyes a few times because I just can’t look at whales without feeling the need to run and hide. That said, this movie is a *masterpiece*! It was hilarious, fun, exciting, and had a great message. Seeing everyone in the 80s was a wild and funny ride. And as much as whales terrify me, I realize that my fear is irrational, and I do think they’re beautiful. So the underlying message of “Save the whales!” is a very welcome one. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Maybe my *absolute* favorite movie of all time. It’s just great.

So, thoughts? Opinions? Disagreements? I wanna hear it all!",My ranking of TOS movies! (New viewer — no spoilers please!)
startrek,"Spoilers for Star Trek Into Darkness, I guess? I couldn't remember exactly what the policy is here, so I figured it was better to be a little vague about it in the title.

I'm talking, anyway, about Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan in Into Darkness. It was a little controversial at the time, understandably, for whitewashing the character, and originally JJ Abrams had wanted to cast Benicio Del Toro in the role.

If you were Abrams, looking for someone to play Khan after Del Toro turned it down, who would you have cast instead? Or do you think Cumberbatch was a great choice worth keeping?",[Spoilers] Who would you have cast in Into Darkness instead of Benedict Cumberbatch?
startrek,"I don't know how many times the TNG era writers painted an agrarian society as idyllic. 

In Devil's Due, the Enterprise visits the Ventaxians who have an ""idyllic agrarian"" society that gave up technology and are better for it (I don't know how they have advanced structures and lighting. Maybe they power their lights with beets or something). 

Sisko and O'Brien crash land on a planet where technology doesn't work and while the episode does portray the societies leader as a bit of an unhinged fanatic, the villagers appreciate the hard won agrarian lifestyle they built for themselves and are considering staying even when the truth comes out and they're able to leave. 

Another DS9 episode the crew crash lands on a planet of their descendants from the crash on the same planet, sure enough their lifestyle is a happy agrarian one (aside from a small faction of ""Klingons"" who live as Hunter-gatherers). 

In Star Trek Insurrection the Baku are yet another advanced species that gave up technology for an agrarian lifestyle that was deemed superior.

Eddington, ever the hipster brags about how the Masquis grow their own food and how much better it tastes than replicated food which sounds less and less appealing as the TNG era winds down. (But still better than Neelix's cooking). 

Supposedly a lot of this is attributed to Michael Piller. But I guess it serves as a reminder that it isn't just the current era's writers that don't get Trek. The series has a history of writers injecting stupid personally held ideas.",So were the TNG era writers Amish or something?
startrek,"I am in the process of my first complete watch of all Star Trek, in order of show release, but I've hit a wall with next gen. There are only 5 episodes left in season six, but I just can't muster enthusiasm. The crew and show seem to have completely lost their edge. 
  Captain Jellico showed Riker to be a shell of the officer he used to be, lately he feels more like a host at a fancy restaurant, than a competent number one.  Picard, while still an able diplomat, just doesn't seem to have the right stuff. The enterprise feels more like the love boat, when it should be pride of the fleet. I just want someone to show some drive or ambition, some passion or rage. The entire crew just seems to be going though the motions. 
  I find myself daydreaming about how good the show could be. If Captain Jellico had stayed on as Captain, and Picard had retired from the fleet, but stayed on as a civilian, we could have had real conflict. Jellico, answerable to the Admiralty, and Picard, as a civilian diplomat, answerable to the UFP council. Both men working for the greatest good in different sometimes competing ways. Instead we have a lackluster gang of buddies bumming around the cosmos.",I've got Next Generation season six fatigue
startrek,"Just wondering if it was only me? I love the original timeline TNG, DS9, Voyager and Picard.

I just don’t ‘get’ the reboots with alternative timelines. The films try too hard to be funny and throw in action shots, the characters aren’t as memorable and the story doesn’t seem to flow well. 

I can’t stand the latest Discovery series, I tried.. I really did... but after 7 episodes of depicting the Klingons as mindless animals who require subtitles I just got sick and switched it off. 

Picard was a brilliant short series. I hope they decide to go for another full series set in the original timeline, perhaps keeping the original idea and having it set after voyager with a slight overlap.",Anyone else hate the reboots?
startrek,"Did anyone else feel that news interview where Picard is attacked by the presenter really forced. Picard is responsible for saving the universe and the Federation so many times it comes out of ""right"" field that he would be attacked for doing something that Federation would have done (in the past) automatically.

So here is an idea on how to fix that scene, an alternate take if you will.

What if the journalist interviewing Picard was non other than Jake Sisko, the man who's  mother was killed  in no small part thanks to Picard's Borg personality, Locutus. In this way, we have a tie into past ST lore not only in DS9 but with the whole BORG-arc. Ghosts of the past coming back to haunt him. 

AND if Jake was the journalist you could see that maybe he may be a little more hostile, even unintentionally so.

Just a thought, as Ive been binging DS9 during the lockdown.

Hope you guys are all okay out there.","Trying to Fix that ""Fox"" news scene in Picard."
startrek,"The whole time travel paradox thing. I'm sorry to say but Avengers: Endgame got it right. If you travel back in time to meet your younger self and kill him/her, you will not begin to fade and cease to exist. If you travel across time, you travel into a different self-containing quantum reality. What happens here doesn't affect where you came from and the only way you could go back to your own quantum reality is if you were to leave a device that acted as a sort of quantum bungee cord that could sling you back.

I think starships in the late 24th/early 25th centuries should be equipped with what I think should be called ""quantum anchors"" that the ships' computers automatically release when they detect a quantum anomaly. Travelling through space, it's very likely for a starship to accidently crash into phenomena that either makes it travel through time or to parallel universes. Whenever such a phenomena is detected, the ship's computer automatically ejects a quantum anchor so the ship can easily and safely travel back to its own time/reality.

A good episode could be the Enterprise-F crashing into a parallel universe and when the crew tries to go through the standard procedures of returning, (conveniently) there's a technical problem in the ship due to damage sustained during the trip. AND, a Terran Empire ship comes across the Enterprise-F causing further delays due to obvious reasons you can think of.",The one thing about Star Trek that needs to be retconned
startrek,"I haven’t watched TOS except the mirror universe and the Tribble episodes, along with the first five episodes, and I’ve been watching through DS9 and I have to say both versions were insanely hilarious. Watched the TOS so I knew what exactly what was going on and DS9 fit perfectly, as it could of course. 

I died twice watching the DS9 version:
once when I realized Worf was talking about the Tribbles ending up in the Klingon ship at the end of TOS and the Tribbles were sworn enemies. It took me a minute to realize it but when I did I had to pause the show and laugh like a madman it was such a great call back to something that was minor at the the time and it had such a long lasting impact. 
The second when Sisko and Dax were searching through the Tribbles at the end and it fit so perfectly as to why it looked like they were being thrown out in TOS because they were! Of course in reality they were being thrown but having an in universe explanation is just as spectacular and great. 

Both episodes are so great and I love the respect DS9 had for the episode and that they just went with the insanity. I do have to ask has the Temporal Agency thing guys always been around just never mentioned or created in this episode for added absurdity? Not saying it was bad and I liked the inclusion because honestly in the Star Trek universe they absolutely need a Temporal Agency thing lol.",I can see why the Tribble story was popular
startrek,"Okay on my rewatching of all Star Trek I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the different casts. A hallmark of trek is it ensemble cast and I ranked them as I saw fit. Would love to see y’all’s rankings as well. 
1. TNG - I think every character is treated with care and given room to be fleshed out for the audience. 
2. DS9 - this could’ve easily been 1 for me. 
3. TOS - purists will be angry but outside of Kirk Spock and McCoy, no one is given good material to work with (gets better in the films)
4. Picard - small sample size but better than others. 
5. ENT - not great but characters are fleshed out better than the series below. Phlox and his interactions with the crew make it for me. 
6. Voyager- I mean, do I need to explain. Writing for characters was bad and some were not given room to grow. 
7. Discovery- doesn’t really have an ensemble cast. (Haven’t seen s2, I know pike comes but he doesn’t stay)

What do you think?",Ensemble Casts Ranked
startrek,"If you pay attention to it; star fleet is supposed to be the naval/airforce/ army for federation. So likewise security is supposed to be the navy seals version of the federation. 
Don’t be the person who simply says- they are explorers not warriors, because yes you’re right. But even so, there is a need for competent security, and ONE important aspect of that is security when you are exploring the unknown. The only physically inclined security personnel was warf- a Klingon. The only attempt at demonstrating what I’m taking about is when enterprise was hunting dusk the Xindi and bright aboard characters who an elite spec ops team from earth. As much as exploring is the number one priority, there are too many scenes where security demonstrated extremely limited hand to have combat ability or overall strength. Watching DS9 and when Siskin is by far the strongest force hunting down the teenage Jwk has dar, and your security is 2 men, 5”8 150 pounds, clearly another huge plot hole. 

There is no difference between this and a engineer who had basic skills, but was no better than the science officer in fixing the warp core. It wouldn’t happen. As much as they are explorers first, one if the most important events of security- the ability to fight is beyond limited in sub standard levels.",Just realized; why are all security personnel skinny/ unintimidating?
startrek,"As part of being out of work I'm watching a lot of Star Trek. I'm currently doing rewatches of TNG and Deep Space Nine, I'm leaning harder into DS9 this go around as I've never seen the entirety of the show in order and I've missed some episodes. Anyway I'm also watching TNG. I watched Lonely Among Us last night and forgot just how boring the episode is. The whole subplot with the two groups of delegates really felt unnecessary as they never really do anything with them. You never see the snake people again after they are transported over. It felt like they could have explored the whole energy being thing more thoughtfully if they dropped the delegate storyline.

Also why did nobody else notice that characters that were effected by the energy were acting strangely? There are some glances here and there that something is going on but nobody acts on it. When Crusher gets infected Troi is there and just looks at her and doesn't really do or say anything. When Crusher goes to the bridge Picard doesn't really do or say anything after she returns to normal. And he doesn't find it odd that she is on the bridge as she should be able to do most if not all of her research from sickbay. Riker and Crusher eventually noticed Picard acting oddly but at that point there have been many instances of other people acting the same way but nobody says anything prior to that. The Sherlock Holmes stuff with Data was the only thing I found enjoyable with this episode. 

With this rewatch I may just skip to the better episodes of the first and second season. I had watched The Last Outpost and Where No One Has Gone Before prior to this. Last Outpost was painfully slow, I still enjoyed WNOHGB. I haven't seen Lonely Among Us in a long time, and forgot how bad it is.",I Just Rewatched Lonely Among Us
startrek,"Data is an artifically constructed being with artificial intelligence and simulated personality. His personhood on the show is recognized by the crew and later acknowledged by Starfleet in turns not without dispute. 

The Doctor, an Emergency Medical Hologram repurposed as Voyager's Chief Medical Officer, is also an artificial construct with artificial intelligence and simulated personality. His personhood is eventually acknowledged by the crew. It comes more slowly than for Data and the Federation never recognizes his personhood but does recognize his intellectual property rights in a kind of strange ruling in a late season Voyager episode. 

The above two artificial constructs that simulate human intelligence and personality to varying degrees are acknowledged as people to varying degrees. 

The holodeck is however capable of running programs that are fully interactive that feature people with simulated personalities that can even emulate real people's personalities (we saw that the Enterprise computer could simulate Dr Leah Brahms's personality with only a 7 percent margin of error based on a psych profile and some lectures she gave). 

And people treat these holographic constructs like playthings. Even in extended simulations like Fairhaven which is supposed to be a persistent simulated community that the Voyager crew develops a relationship with, Janeway has no problem editing one of the holograms to suit her preferences. She alters his physical traits and educational background to make him more desirable and deletes his wife, editing his marital status to single. I might appreciate being made more desirable but I don't think I'd go for you retconning my hypothetical wife out of existence just so you could date me. 

Whats the difference between these holographic characters and The Doctor and Data? Where is the line that separates the artificial intelligences with rights from the ones without rights? 

Clearly there is a line somewhere, I don't think, for example, when I stomp Goombas as Mario in a Super Mario game, I'm committing murder. Starfleet likewise seems to be of the opinion that Dr. Bashir is not committing murder when he runs his Julian Bashir Secret Agent programs. Nor is he committing any other offenses when he uses the female characters in the simulation for his fantasies (I have no idea how far he takes it which is why I'm being vague). 

So what do you think? Do you think there's room for fully interactive simulated people that can be used as toys or in games? Did they get that right with the holodeck?","Data, the Doctor, the Holodeck, and Personhood."

It's an opinion I've held for a long time, that the Enterprise-A should have been the Excelsior. Star Trek is about progress and change, and making the Enterprise-A in my opinion another refit-Constitution-class is against progress and change, it's just more of the same and it was a safe decision from the studio who didn't want to anger the fans, which in my opinion was a mistake, and if fans didn't like the name Excelsior, they could have just renamed her Enterprise.

Gladly, a mistake they didn't repeat with Picard, since after the destruction of the Enterprise-D, they didn't give him another Galaxy-class, and I was grateful for that.",[unpopular opinion?] The Enterprise-A should have been the Excelsior

The headstone has birth and death dates which I can only assume are meant to be Kirk's, but they don't seem to correspond to any dates I've found when looking for Kirk's birthday or for the Stardate that Kirk says it is in the Captains log at the end of the episode.

Every episode takes place in a slightly different location as he tries to find somewhere he can play uninterrupted. The opening credits are set to him playing scales.

startrek,"One of my favorite aspects of The Next Generation is how well it does minor characters, and one of my most beloved is the complicated Captain Jellico from the season six two-parter, ""Chain of Command."" 

First of all, that name. Captain Jellico. Fucking rolls off the tongue as if it is the very embodiment of God's gift of language. Only the man that is Captain Jellico can carry this name, and oh boy does he carry it well. Fast walking in and out of scene, curtly delivering orders, overreacting to the most minor resistances...Captain Fucking Jellico. The guy looks like cable's eye-pleasing fill-in for Steve Buscemi, and this makes me dream of an even greater Captain Jellico that could have been, but all these elements of the non-buscemi Captain Jellico make him the absolute gift he is. 

In a sense, Captain Jellico represents the antithesis to the usual Picardian Enterprise. He enters inexplicably, taking command from Picard and replacing the more liberal, beloved, and trusted captain with the conservative, authoritarian, and private Captain Jellico. Despite going against all leadership form Picard built the show on, I can't help but love Captain Jellico. The guy knows what needs to be done and he gets it done. Say what you will about the authoritarian leader, Jellico is the guy you want when someone has to take charge. Orderly, diligent, and unwavering, Jellico is a real leader. Hell, he makes you wonder just how much off-camera time Picard was able to spend in the holodeck while everyone else figured out for themselves what the hell they should be doing. The guy even relieved Riker of command, seeing him as the superfluous bumbling buffoon he is (yeah I said it and bringing him back was a cheap plot point). 

Just how many crises could have been averted if Captain Jellico was in charge? He straight up told Picard all odds pointed to him dying and a war ensuing before he left on his ridiculous secret mission. Oh and what do you know, Picard spends all of part two getting tortured af.  Not to mention, Jordy, Riker, and other Jellico-deniers were fully aware the weight of their diplomacy mission even if they weren't aware of Picard's secret mission. Plus, if he didn't drop enough hints that there was another mission going on these guys don't deserve to be in Star Fleet. The crew should be ashamed of themselves for needing such a kick in the ass when they are in all likelihood flying into war. Jellico isn't even always a dictator, look at him, Geordie, and Data working together to save Picard's ass in part two, or him helping Picard get more recon data for his mission. The guy knows how serious space diplomacy actually is, and despite all the pickles the crew repeatedly finds themselves in, he is condemned for this concerned view. 

Finally, Captain Jellico saves the damn day, with his classic abrupt diplomacy. Yeah sure, Picard resisted his torture (except he was seconds from breaking if not for Jellico), but let's not forget about the real hero of the day. The guy just cooly takes off and nobody even thanks him!

Believe me, I could go on, but the fact of the matter is there is only one Greatest Captain of All Time, and that is Captain Fucking Jellico you sheep.",On Captain Jellico (TNG)

So, it's my understanding that the Borg queen is a construct of the collective, a voice for them a physical form. So, by that logic when Picard was turned into Locutus, was he a borg king? Seeing as he spoke for the borg? The only thing that messed with that theory in my head is how the queen spoke to him and was ""there"" the whole time. So, I'm just curious if Picard became a borg king of sorts. And if not, what he'd be classified as in the collective. (other than a simple drone)

startrek,"I recently decided to rewatch Star Trek, specifically Deep Space 9, and try to read ""between the lines"" of the story and try to find the meaning or parallel to our society (or at least society as it was at the time of the original airing).  It's been fun so far (I'm only in Season 1), but I admit I'm drawing a blank when it comes to the episode ""Captive Pursuit.""  


To recap: DS9 makes it's first First Contact with a species from the Gamma Quadrant when a ship comes through the wormhole.  O'Brien befriends the only person on the ship ,who goes simply by ""Tosk,"" as he helps him repair the ship.  It is later revealed that Tosk is the prey in a predator/prey type society when the predators come looking for him.  Threats are made, insults thrown, and in the end O'Brien helps Tosk escape to resume the ""hunt"" rather than be brought home disgraced by being captured alive. 

I'm really struggling to see the parallels here.  The closest thing that I can come up with in modern society is the ""fox hunts"" that upper-class English hold as tradition.  (I do not wish to offend anybody so if this tradition is no longer practiced please let me know).

startrek,"I would like to know how others regard this episode. Here are my thoughts:

This was a really frustrating episode for me. It had a great concept and one that could potentially provoke tons of emotion, but it’s riddled with bad acting from Emerson, choppy editing, weird plot details and a virtually non existent B story about the Kir’Shara.

I never understood why Emerson didn’t just tell Archer the truth once he was aboard and then just pretend like the experiment didn’t work when he left. He and Archer were already close so he would’ve most likely had support for the experiment. 

Also the writing for Trip was off. One minute he was arguing profusely with Archer and by the end of the episode he was ok with everything without any resolve occurring on screen. Plus Phlox mentioned that Quinn was suffering from cellular disintegration so wouldn’t he not beam aboard with his body practically breaking down. 

In the previous episode Kir’Shara, T’Pau mentioned that it would take years to translate the ancient texts. Yet, a week later(as stated by Trip), they have apparently already deciphered many of the texts including a cure for Ponar syndrome.

Overall this episode had the potential to be a very thought provoking and emotional episode but it falls flat on its face due to a number of script problems. A disappointment as Season 4 of ENT is my personal favourite season out of all the shows. A 1/5 for me.",Enterprise S4 EP10 Daedalus
startrek,"It always bugs me whenever a character gets beamed up, he or she stands still for a few seconds while the beaming animation commences and you see them slowly disappear. Didn't it ever bother the writers? You write a tense situation where the characters beam away at the last moment, and then you have them standing still for 3 seconds or something. The animation also kind of looks campy in that regard.

Yet there is that episode on TNG where a planet steals all children from the Enterprise, and they do so with a transporter of their own. The animation for that is fast and crisp. They are blinked away almost instantly.",Why did they decide on having the transporter being so slow? [TNG-DS9-VOY-era]
startrek,"I want to begin by saying I think William Shatner really ""became"" Kirk in TOS cast films ranging from '79-'91.  

He's a magnetic presence, bursting with emotion, and for the most part his dialogue is expertly-written.  He's given understandable character motivation, interesting arcs, and he is the literal star of the films -- although I would say the infamous triumvirate is featured so well that each film barring TMP is a two-tiered ensemble piece.

So here's my rankings, and I'm keen to see everyone else's!

**1. The Search For Spock** - Nimoy knew how to direct The Shatner and it shows.  There's a lot of meat and scenery for Billy to chew in this.  His play-acting and then impishness during the Enterprise heist is wonderful.  And of course, his reaction to David's death, the desperation of the fight with Kruge, and reunion with Spock make for a killer third act performance.


**2. The Voyage Home** - This was in a dead heat with SFS which won for the dramatic material.  The tone of this film is a feat; the tension and stakes are there but it's such a warm, fuzzy blanket of an experience.  This is due very much to Shatner, as he gives an enchanting take on a newly-evolved Kirk.  The outtakes on YouTube show what a loose atmosphere Nimoy had set up.


**3. The Wrath of Khan** - I actually find this turn to be the odd one out.  You can tell Meyer exhausted him, but the 50th take of a technical jargon line does work better than the bravado of Captain Mid-Life Crisis (TMP).  It's a transitional Kirk, and Shat slays his scenes with Carol, David and Khan.  Not to mention his raw eulogy and poignant final words with Carol are the best writing Kirk ever had.  I am of the opinion his defeated posture laying against the pane opposite Spock is the most powerful ST image ever.


**4. The Motion Picture** - An underrated performance!  I can't get enough of his posturing in the first half.  Once things loosen up and he's rocking that pajama top, his whimsy shines through and TOS fans could delight in a character who had changed with age...but not really.


**5. The Undiscovered Country** - Fresher than expected and charming as hell.  He leads the second half effortlessly while the sabotage subplot drags on.  What a great send-off.


**6. The Final Frontier** - not a bad performance by any means, merely the least of some greatness.  He's a nice anchor to the bizarre stuff, is hilarious with Spock &amp; Bones, and seems to direct himself decently.

startrek,"I've been watching all of Star Trek the last 4 years and I just hit Enterprise. I've been quite enjoying it so far, and everything about it. It's much better than Voyager in my opinion, especially with the outright likability of characters. (And no barrage of Holodeck episodes)

But the main thing I like about Enterprise is the use of Alien Language. The infancy of the Universal Translator makes it seem like the world is so much more fleshed out, and the crew actually needs to struggle in understanding how to communicate with people. (Also, Faith of the Heart is great!)",Use of Language in ENT
startrek,"When I watch Star Trek, I watch it in order. I just finished watching DS9. After that I'll watch Voyager, then Enterprise, then Discovery,  and then Picard. After that I go back to the original and move forward. Living in China, I've had a lot of time on my hands, so I'm not joking when I say that I've cycled through it twice since January 27th. (when lockdown started)

I don't really know where to start here. But when I was in the middle of season 4 of DS9 4-5 days ago, I started thinking about posting this. I'm pretty sure that 99% of people who actually address MY concerns on topic are going to give me the answer I don't want to hear, but I need to hear it all the same because it's very important to me. 

Star Trek is kind of like a religion to me. I don't have Treky friends. Like I know a few people who watch, but their passion and level of knowledge isn't on my level, so we never bother chatting about it. My parents are good people who went out of their way to make sure that I had a strong sense of right and wrong, but I really feel that Star Trek continued teaching me these kinds of lessons and still gives me great insights on a multitude of topics to this day kinda like the Bible or Quran helps others. 

I'll start with this: I've never been a huge fan of the Star Trek films and I feel like the past 2 TV series have been modeled after the films. I don't mean like the past 2 series have been modeled after the NEW films with Kirk and Spok. I mean ALL of the films.

First, I have nothing against people who enjoy Picard and Discovery, but they really don't quench my thirst and the films never did. Whenever I've watched a Star Trek film in theater I've thought that it's a great fan experience, but it's not something I can marathon or have the urge to watch over and over again. 

Action gets boring. Like, how do I put this? If I was training MMA as a hobby I'm sure I could rewatch every single one of GSP or Anderson Silva's matches 100 times over to gain insight. But I'm not, so I'm just going to watch their fights as many times as I need to feel that I understood what happened and why the fight come to it's eventual conclusion.

When I watched Star Trek films, Discovery for Picard for the first time  I kinda got the same feeling except I was watching those TV series in my home. When I cycle through and get to Discovery and Picard it kinda depresses me and forces me to question whether or not we'll see another series that has a strong emphasis on discovery.

Before I contradict myself, I'm going to briefly describe how I view each series.

**Star Trek:** The original dream. A snippet of what life could be like for humans if we could get over our egos.

**Star Trek Next Generation:** More polished version of Star Trek

**Deep Space 9:** Stronger focus on globalism and multiculturalism and a lot of puppetry.

**Voyager:** Epic sci-fi remake of Homeward Bound.

**Enterprise:** Gritty prequel that puts Archer on a pedestal the soars miles above Kirk, Picard, Sisko and Janeway.

**Discovery:** Affirms that the ""Me Too"" movement is to be taken seriously. Makes everything look more technologically advanced since there were so many kinds of technology in the previous series that don't seem quite as far out of our grasp as they used to.

**Picard:** 100% unadulterated fan service.

Hear me out, Patrick Stewart is my TV dad. I knew it before I even knew the term TV dad, but from my perspective we aren't getting Star Trek that introduces me to anything new. I'm not a well read individual. I might read 10-15 books a year and no more than 3 of those will be fictional. 

I get more out of Discovery than Picard and watching every episode of Discovery for the first time reminded me what sadness felt like because I had this crazy idea in my head that Hollywood was still capable assisting me with the broadening of my mind.

I absolutely love the quality of the special effects in the latter 2 series, but is it too much to ask for new content?","Would it be profitable to make another Star Trek series like TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager or Enterprise? Warning: Excessively long!"
startrek,"Just want to say I’m in season 4 and the show has grown on me a lot that I enjoy it. Mostly what I meant by the episodes is more what is necessary viewing and worth watching. From my experience the first 5 episodes of S1, and 2 of course, are necessary. While there’s some in season 1 it’s mostly forgettable and I was really bored during it. S2 had more but again mostly same until I think about episode 15 or 16. I did complain about them cause 14-16 all had O’Brian as s**t out of luck but either 15 or 16 really started it going for me. I think that’s about the time they find the Founders:
S3 I’ve always heard is where the show really picks up and I have to agree as that season and up to where I am now are great. So I agree on that but it does need the last 10+ episodes of S2 to work cohesively. The show grew on me I’ll say that much. 

Now to Odo. I f***ing love this guy. No nonsense but has an amazing sense of humor that I love along with his love/hate/respect relationship with Quark, who should seriously be in prison but that’s beside the point. Right now on episode “Bar Association”, #15 if that’s better, and he straight up calls out a few of the times the Enterprise D got boarded and/or looted. Finally someone acknowledges that the Enterprise got jacked or whatever! 

Seriously the flagship of the Federation got boarded so many times, by non omniscient/omnipotent beings since they are harder to defend against, it kinda bothered me in S6 with the Die Hard in space episode, not saying it wasn’t a great episode it was. I’m just glad someone said something about it out loud: not some admiral reading the reports and going “Jesus Christ. The Enterprise. Boarded again! That’s the fifth time this year and the 10th since Picard took over.” Probably not that much but let’s be fair it’s still a significant number of times. Those security updates every year didn’t help lol. 

Side note even with all this I would love it if the Enterprise E also had a number of the same types of things and the admiral I mentioned just gave up and resigned after the first cause he was just so done with the Enterprises’ ridiculous situations. And he’s a descendant of an admiral that was doing the same in Kirks time so it’s like a family curse for the Enterprise. “No way this new enterprise after 100+ years is going to end up like that one.” Literally a week later “We just got word the Enterprise D came back from an alternate dimension” the admiral flips a table out his window. 
Very long tangent but I hope someone reads that and gets some measure of joy from it cause I enjoyed writing it lol.",Couple of things on DS9: general opinion on what episodes are good and Odo
startrek,"Tuvix. It's clear a lot of people don't like him. And it seems clear that this is because of two main reasons:

1) The ethical predicament which the crew is forced into as a result of his existence is also forced onto the audience. We don't want to think about it because it makes us uncomfortable. And we hate what makes us uncomfortable.

2) He's not conventionally attractive. Now this is what kind of what bothers me. The whole point (as we all very well know) of Star Trek is to see the bigger picture, to maintain mind over matter and seek justice whenever the opportunity presents itself.

I agree with what Captain Janeway chose in the end, because Tuvok (whose culture teaches him that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few) and Neelix didn't consent to losing their preexisting individuality. If their consciousnesses could have been separated while they were merged, they probably would've advocated to return to that individuality. Of course this is a luxury they didn't have, but I think we can agree that they didn't like it any more than anyone else did.

Cultural mindset is an ever-evolving thing. Right now discrimination against what is socially deemed un-beautiful is just as real as other forms of discrimination. It's just not in the sociocultural or political spotlight right now. We're all hardwired to favor what looks and acts like us: humanoid, laterally symmetrical, emotional. Understandable.

Maybe I'm taking this too seriously but the fact this episode was and is so controversial only highlights an underlying sentiment that doesn't coincide with the values of Star Trek and, by extension, our values as a fandom. In scifi and in real life we're faced at any moment with the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial lifeforms that evolved from a culmination of innumerable variables, we can't possibly imagine what they'd look, sound, or behave like. All I know is if we ever do encounter aliens, they will be so unlike us that we won't know what to feel other than absolute terror, at least initially. We would owe it to them to let go of our anthropocentric and egocentric beliefs and desires. We have empathy; it's our duty to use it.",Hear me out guys pls
startrek,"It seems a lot of fans feel it's too nihilistic to be considered part of Star Trek, and Picard isn't his usual self? Do you guys feel the same? 

The thing I love the most about TNG is Picard's assertiveness and wisdom, and how he leads the charge despite people around him disagreeing at times. If he's just a passenger, and getting pushed around as some clips seem to suggest on Youtube.. i'll probably give it a pass. I hope this isn't the case.. as the production looks really good in the trailers.

startrek,"Sometime after the synth ban, Thaddeus contracted "" mendaxic neurosclerosis"" which could easily be cured by curating cells in an ""active positronic matrix."" Unfortunately there was no positronic matrix due to the ban. After all, it's not like the Daystrom Institute had one just sitting in a cupboard...

Oh wait.

Now the obvious answer is that turning on B4 (or Lore for that matter as he is presumably dismantled and in a different cupboard somewhere) would be illegal. But this isn't some random kid, this is the son of Captain William flipping Riker! And we know it's possible to only activate B4's cognitive functions and not his motor ones thanks to Nemesis. Not to mention Data and B4's heads have run disconnected from any bod on several occasions. I think Jurati mentions B4's matrix collapsed like Lal's. But even if that's the case shouldn't Lore be around? And does it really matter if the positronic net is working so long as there's power running through it? These are just cells growing in an friendly environment after all.

I struggle to see Will not making every effort to save his son and Starfleet to refuse his request to turn on a head on a table, no matter how evil that head may be.

startrek,"Hello there! So bit of background. For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).

startrek,"It cost $70,000 per episode of TNG to remaster. This was almost ten years ago. They have made a ton of money with rerun TV deals and much more with streaming. This is cost effective, since HD is more preferable and has an easier sell through. With inflation, and more needed CGI needed let's say each episode of DS9 would now cost $200,000.

That's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).

Even Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.

Then there's CBS all access, who is now paying a lot of money for new Star Trek content with partner deals (Disco, Netflix, and Picard, Amazon). Even they could afford this to entice new subscribers. Something that didn't exist before when it was only a physical disk market and the Blu-rays were sold for far too high a price. 

The lower bar to entry the more money made. They would have made more money with the Blu-rays at a lower price. The lower bar now is definitely streaming. There was complaint that the Blu-rays didn't sell enough, what they didn't say is how well they did with the TV syndication deals, and the HD Netflix, Amazon deals.

I know the ending and how things go their but to finally have the foundation is really enjoyable . I know Voyager gets allot of hate and I don’t disagree with it but I still enjoy it. All the actors are great in Season 1. Tom Paris telling Chakotay to turn into a bird and fly away is laughable in the worst possible way . Neelix is ridiculous as he always has been. The doctor is awesome. I’m so enjoying this.,I’m really enjoying rewatching Voyager
startrek,"Being slightly provocative, but generally I think it is true.  


The original series was shot in the 60's. Of course it looks antiquated and that Kirk is a bit misogynistic, but when you compare it to other shows at the time it was streets ahead. I'm also amazed at how much of a difference the re-mastered version makes!  


I like TNG, but there is this fable about it that it was all good. For me, I think the first 2 seasons were awfully nd it got better in season 3. It wasn't until season 4 that it gets really good.  


DS9, of the TNG/DS/Voy era is my favourite. The Federation is now not so squeaky clean and perfect like they are in TNG. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the positive outlook for Humanity. In fact, I love it. However, I'm not so naive to think that Humanity will be wonderful in another 300 years. We'll still have our issues, and DS9 is good at showing that.  


Voyager, an attempt together back to the travelling spaceship but have a different look &amp; feel. Just too many annoying characters (Yes I'm looking at you Neelix.. at least Wesley grew out of being annoying!). I'm certainly enjoying it more than I did the first time and it does have some of my favourite characters in it (The Dr, 7 of 9).

Enterprise. I feel so sorry for it. If you look at it really, it was good right out of the door. I reckon if they'd got their full 7 seasons it would now be regarded as one of the best Trek's. I like the premise of Humanity really first getting out there. Sure, I know that T'Pol was brought in to be eye candy for the guys, but she does a brilliant Vulcan! I actually like the whole Crew.

Discovery. How can people not watch it, or only watch 2 seasons and say it is awful? Think of the first 2 seasons of TNG for god's sake! I love Discovery. I think they've done a great job at a difficult time period. I think the guest captains (Lorca, Pike) were also great! I can do the suspension of belief about the Klingons too. Why does everyone give this a hard time, when they ignore the difference in the Klingons between TOS and ST:The Movie? Sure, it's not episodic. So what? That's not how TV is watched now (I""m binge watching Voyager at the moment). I love that you watch the season, see the ends nd then watch it again and get some of the subtleties you missed the first time around.

Picard: TNG 3.0 (TNG 2.0 was the movies). I like it. Again, not episodic. Funnily enough though, Whilst Picard is the glue, I'm enjoying the other characters more. I forget his name, but the Roman Samurai needs to be fleshed out more and I hope we see more of him, but everyone else is great! I really didn't like the Riker to the rescue though. Why would they put a reserve captain in charge of an entire squadron? Stupid! He'd done his cameo, wasn't necessary.  


TAS: I missed that. I've always had problems with it, but I suspect I'll find it interesting now... going off how I'm disliking Voyager less. Also because nuances of TAS have crept into Discovery. I'd love to see this redone in CGI.  


All in all, we are damn lucky we aren't Star Wars fans, although I do watch it, we have great TV to watch. Some of the best ever made and for a 50 years old TV program to stand the test of time is amazing!

S5E6 ""Timeless"". The first major breaking of the temporal directive by members of the voyager crew. Really good episodes. Interesting when you see half of sevens cranium. However, the whole episode is excellent. Interesting Captain La Forge.... yet he isn't a Captain in the prequels for Picard (Comics/Books). yes I know it is a different time line.

S5E7 ""Infinite Regress"". Great story. Basically Borg schizophrenia. Some amazing acting from Jerry Ryan. Especially when she changes personalities. The switch is just stunning at times. Also an interesting story line in that she's seeing people whom she has assimilated.

S5E8 ""Nothing Human"". The creature that attaches itself to B'Elanna is absolutely crap. However, the whole story on the morality of using medical research based on, at beast, questionable techniques is superb.

S5E11""Latent Image"". AN interesting ethical dilemma that they resolve in the end, but what I really loved about this episode is it is again an extension of the Dr where he ceases to be less machine and more a sentient life form. He actually talks about the algorithms he has to help him make decisions, and in this case he is given a no-win situation where he has to make a choice, and then how doe she deal with it.

Even if Saavik had give the wrong command, Sulu wouldn't have crashed the Enterprise. And the only two commands she gives (that we can hear) are ""aft thrusters Mr Sulu...

I've had this conversation with a lot of friends since the Picard finale and I have agree, it feels like there was a different ending planned and many people think the whole android body thing was a cop out.

Was the original plan right up till the end for Picard to die and not be resurrected but that plan got sidelined when Pat Stewart decided he was having fun and wanted to do season 2?

There's really absolutely no reason to do the android body thing--- what does it get them? It's not like Stewart was playing a significantly older character and with an android body he could now play his own age and jump around. It's not like people would have questioned Picard still adventuring at his age and 24th century medicine keeping him going. 

I've had numerous people say to me this was a cop out and a way to kill Picard but not really kill him so they can do season 2.  Rewatching Nepenthe and Post-Nepenthe I have to agree.

startrek,"I’ll admit that the color divisions for Federation officers has always puzzled me. Especially because they change so often. 
And, although Deanna did not wear traditional Starfleet clothing for the better part of her appearance, whenever she does it, she wears blue.

Anyways, as far as I’m concerned (in TNG and subsequent) the color blue is associated with Medical/Science, yellow is Security/Engineering and red is... Well... Red... I think that red regards to command, but I’m not so sure because of Wesley, Geordi and Worf wearing those colors when they belong on Security or Engineering even at lower ranking. I guess in both Geordi and Wesley’s case they wore red because they were often found on ships’s helm. 
In any case... Feel free to explain it to me since I clearly can’t understand on my own. 

Now to Deanna. As ship’s counselor, I would assume her rank is not only more related to commanding the ship as it is a pretty high one at that. I would assume she would wear red as well. Heck, I could even make more of a case for yellow than blue. Why blue? If it’s in regard to her position as almost a psychiatrist to the ship then it makes sense because it would be Medical, but she helps command the ship more then she helps the crew...

I’m ok with out-of-universe explanations like: “Marina Sirtis just liked blue better” as far as I know the whole red and yellow swap in between series happened because of reasons like that. But I wonder if there is an explanation in the lore for her wearing blue...

(If there is an explanation in-universe for the yellow/red swap, it would be awesome to know as well...)

startrek,"I just started watching the show. “Enterprise” puts in so much more effort into its alien cultures than other Trek shows. I don’t know if this continues to be the case, but 10 episodes in, I’ve really been enjoying how much world building this show gets done. The alien ship in “Unexpected” for example- the three hours of decompression before going on-board, the food growing on the walls, the different looking aliens with their electricity-like powers. The underground society of Terra Nova, their different way of speaking, the “diggers” that they hunt and how they use their skulls as musical instruments. The design of the Vulcan monastery. There were episodes of Voyager where they didn’t even bother to give the aliens forehead ridges, they just looked and behaved like humans and decorated with IKEA furniture.

It’s not just alien cultures, but the world building regarding human culture that I’ve been impressed with too. They don’t have Federation ideals to live up to because there is no Federation yet.  I like how informal and giddy they are, building snowmen on comets, preparing messages for schools on Earth, pointing out the sun in the night sky. Stuff like this makes it feel real to me. Of course the translator isn’t perfect, they’ve barely met any aliens. Of course they’re all scared to use the transporter, dude just beamed up with twigs in his face!

startrek,"Someone on here once summarized Enterprise as ""Bush era Star Trek"" and that nails it for me.

TNG and DS9 might be distinctively 90ies in their own way, but they encapsulate all the charm of low-budget sci-fi first and foremost. I would describe them as ""human"" rather than ""American"" or specifically dated to any decade. Same as the original series being obviously from the 60ies, but more so: timeless.

Enterprise is tainted by all the cold ugliness of early-2000s American television. Especially from a European perspective, it feels so distinctively national all of a sudden that it's really off-putting. it's not in the setting (post-national earth and space) or storyline, it's all evident on a meta-level in the languages of production, setpieces, character writing, themes, set design, costumes.

The whole show feels like it's desperate to be less niche and nerdy and more widely appealing to general American audiences in 2002 and as a result, lost its soul in the process.

I mean... There is a character named ""Trip Tucker"" who looks exactly like his dumb jock name. He likes to punch people.

TL:DR:

Enterprise lacks the warm and familiar, hopeful and fantastical identity of other Trek. If Jack Bauer had a guest spot on an Enterprise episode, he would feel *less out of place there* than a member of the Enterprise crew who  appeared on another Star Trek show in turn.

Three acknowledgements for fairness' sake:

\- Setting a Trek series at that specific time period is actually a really cool idea. The show does get a little better as it goes on. There is some character development, even for f\*\*\* Trip.

\- I was harsh on the era, but there were many good tv shows in the early 2000s (although some of them held up much worse than you'd think)

\- if you like Enterprise, good for you, you are not wrong. It's a preference. I just think that there's like, an 80% likelihood you're also American and like to watch \*The Shield\*.","Reflecting on why I can't bring myself to love ""Enterprise"" like the other shows"
startrek,"I have been rewatching Voyager after the finale of Picard; and, after she goes full-on eye dilation in the cell, I got the impression that 7 is destined for Borg royalty. 

Here's my evidence. 

Going back to Dark Frontier,  you first see 7 and the queen interact.  What's so surprising about this is that the queen uses personal pronouns.   This is a trait that both she and 7 have in common.

Furthermore,  in the same episode, it's revealed that drones from unimatrix 01 are in close proximity to the queen.  7 of 9 is tertiary adjunct for 01, so we can infer that 7 had previous intersection with the queen prior to Scorpion.  Also, if we understand that higher numbers mean higher rank, as was the case when Harry Kim was demoted from 6 to 2 of 10 in the Omega Directive, then it adds more weight to the evidence that 7 would have routinely been in proximity to the queen. Though it's not clear the consequences of that proximity,  7 would have been an on hand for the queen.


Next, referring back to Dark Frontier, the queen focuses on teaching 7 lessons.  She tries to have her choose to adopt the Borg way, rather than have it foisted upon her.   The goal was to preserve the same individuality that the queen demonstrates,  but have 7 agree that the Borg way is correct.  This duality of making individual choices, but for the benefit of the collective,  may be a key requirement for coronation. 

Also, in the same episode, 7 is able to persuade the queen to let refugees escape assimilation,  7 is immediately tended to after a minor injury (royal treatment for a borg?), the queen compromises on her duties because she doesn't want to push 7 too hard (compromise is irrelevant), reveals that 7 was placed on Voyager to regain individuality, and apologizes that the lessons are difficult for 7.

This is all done under the guise of conquering humanity,  but consider that things can have dual intents.  While assimilating humanity is an obvious goal, this could also be about making 7 get successor.

Lastly, I refer you the Picard episodes involving Ex-Bs.  Their disconnection from the collective leaves the drones' personalities damaged.   But, as the queen says, 7 is the only drone to gain  Individuality.   This difference may be what would eventually empower 7 to exert will like the queen if/when crowned.  In Broken Pieces,  7 exerts this exact will in the cell after being wired in a similar fashion as the queen.  She fits the queen pattern.",My fan theiry: 7 of 9 was/is next in like to succeed the Borg Queen

But I was pretty sad because a lot of it was just talking about how the series has a lot of 'missed opportunities', etc... I remember one critique was regarding how quickly the whole crew got along instead of having lingering harsh feelings.

Maybe it's just because of quarantine and covid, but I *love* that they set aside their differences for the shared goal of **simply going home.** They knew they had to be there for each other. They knew they had to put their best talents to work in order to advance their mission and hopefully find an ingenious way of getting back to Earth.

startrek,"Personally I felt it dragged on way to long. During season seven we would be doing something with the war like the resistance or Starfleet, but then we would go back to Dukat and Winn and I’d just sigh. It felt like they were just putting enough in there to develop the story and to remind you that the plot existed but they needed to drag it for an entire season, so there wouldn’t be enough to actually answer anything. Then there was the finale. The dominion war ended very well, we had our big fight(that refused footage sadly), the founder gave up, we had tension with the Cardasians and then their switch midway through(which was lucky for Starfleet, since I noticed they were using the same tactics Robert E Lee used at Gettysburg and you know how that turned out.), you then went to the treaty and everything was fine, but then you had Dukat. He goes and summons the Pah wraiths. My problem is that I’ve never liked, “wipe out everything” threats, and that is exactly what the Pah-wraiths are. The only times I see them fitting is over the top superhero films, and DS9 isn’t one. Then Sisko destroys them by throwing him, Dukat and the book over into the fire, and now he is with the profits(I think?) I think it’s just me but it feels like an unsatisfying end to his character. I know the Prophets said that he could never live on Bajor, but really? You couldn’t have him move back to Earth, or just say fuck the Prophets and live on Bajor.

startrek,"The Silent Star (""Der Schweigende Stern"") is a 1960 East German/Polish science fiction film based on ""The Astronauts"" by  Stanisław Lem. While it is set (probably) in the 1970s as opposed to the 2260s, it has a very Star Trek Original Series vibe. It is about a multi-national group of scientists who have put aside earth-bound concerns (race, religion, politics, nationality) to get into a spaceship and go on an adventure together for the good of all humanity. 

But what is interesting is that you are seeing this familiar story told through a Soviet Bloc lens. In TOS, everyone works together but implicitly everyone is basically American - the ship is even the ""USS Enterprise"". In The Silent Star, it is implicit that the Soviets have the upper hand.

An example of what I mean: Toward the beginning, some reporters are interviewing the mission leader, a soviet professor. 
Reporter: ""Why not just a team of Soviet scientists? It's their rocket!"" 
Cosmonaut: ""Landing on Venus cannot only belong to one nation. We are not just internationalist in our politics. In a peaceful world we don't keep our successes to ourselves.""

The rocket is Soviet-built and they are letting an American tag along from a sense of good-will. The Soviets were also the first to land on the moon, and have an international research base there. It's the same happy, cooperative future, but with the Soviets on top! 

It's no surprise that a show made by and for Americans would be pro-American, and one by and for members of the Soviet Bloc would be pro-Soviet. I think it's an interesting jumping-off point for thinking about the implicit assumptions of Star Trek, though. A ""Star Trek"" made by Vulcans might look very different again. 

One last note, I don't want to push this film too hard: The plot is well-trodden ground by this point, and the details are a bit hard to follow in places. The gender politics are _very_ TOS as well, unfortunately. But I think in general, TOS fans may get a kick out of it.","Star Trek through a cold war lens: ""The Silent Star"" (1960)"
startrek,"I just recently finished watching the entire DS9 series for the first time. As a longtime fan of Voyager, TNG, and TOS, I never got around to watching DS9 until now. I simply wanted to praise the show - it was a really enjoyable experience to watch. Specifically:

* I felt like overall, the writing was consistently good throughout the series. Like other longstanding series of Trek I felt like the show definitely picked up and got better as it progressed. 
* I enjoyed the portrayal of Sisko and his son Jake as a normal single father and son relationship. They just genuinely loved each other and there wasn't ever any weird or forced tension between the two of them. It was simple, and it worked.
* I absolutely adored Odo and his whole backstory. I would have loved to have seen more done with him as a character, and I wish he would have been given more opportunities to use his unique shapeshifting abilities. Rene Auberjonois did an outstanding job in that role.
* I enjoyed the interesting storytelling that came out of the Dax character. I thought they handled the transition to Ezri Dax surprisingly well considering she was in it just for the one season.
* I loved Garek as a side character. Initially I thought he was really weird but I appreciated the development and attention he was given. I thought the actor who played him did a really good job. I wish there would have been more of him!
* I absolutely hated Vedek/Kai Winn but I think that is a testament to the actress's portrayal of her character and her writing. Both were well done.
* I did think Dukat was resurrected as a character too much. Once would have been fine but he ""came back"" too much after I was given the impression he was gone for good.
* I felt like the very last episode tied things up better than I expected it to. Compared to the very last episode of Voyager I found it to be a lot more believable and realistic.
* Standout episodes (sorry don't remember the specific names or #):
   * The one where the team recruits Garek to sneak into Cardassia
   * The one where they travel back in time to the TOS era (brilliant writing and editing in this one)
   * The one where Jake loses his dad in a freak accident and his entire life plays out trying to get his dad back (very good writing in this one - I cried!!)
   * The one where they form a baseball team - loved when Odo, with great satisfaction, booted people from the game.
* Can an HD remaster of DS9 and Voyager happen please?!?!

startrek,"I've been reading a lot lately about the constant advancements in virtual reality tech. Just last year London's Saatchi Gallery immersed visitors in a twenty-minute, interactive (mostly) ""virtual reality experience"" that they could see, hear, smell, and feel on their skin. Haptic tech is making it possible to experience the sensation of touching virtual objects or standing in a virtual wind. Right now VR developers are busy incorporating eye tracking tech into VR headsets, making better-quality graphics possible, because the virtual environment only has to be in full resolution where the user is looking. Artificial intelligence may soon enable non-player characters to engage in natural conversations. VR is constantly getting better at imitating reality. Eventually, it may seem very real.

Reading about all of the constant progress in VR led me to imagine a future in which you could experience almost anything you've seen in an episode of Star Trek, as if you were inside the Star Trek universe, almost like a holodeck with programs based on Star Trek episodes. Think of it. What if you could experience what it would be like to  stand on the bridge of the Enterprise, whichever registry number you prefer, as it goes into warp, pilot the Defiant through the Bajoran wormhole, challenge Kira Nerys to a game of springball, or visit the city of ShiKahr on the planet Vulcan with Spock as your guide? Personally, I'd be thrilled just to be able to walk the promenade of Deep Space Nine and see my favorite characters there or explore the interior of the Enterprise D.

I really adored the three-way interaction between Seska, Culluh, and Janeway. Culluh is a deeply egotistical man who comes from a deeply misogynistic culture. Yet here, he is caught in between two extremely assertive, intelligent, and cunning women. As the negotiations slip out of his control, his own impotent misogynist rage drives him to attempt to reassert his authority, but Janeway just shuts him down and later so does Seska too.

Given Seska's skills and her domineering personality, it's very likely that had their takeover of Voyager in ""Basics"" succeeded, the Nistrim would have conquered all the other Kazon sects and began presiding over a united Kazon species. Culluh would be the de jure leader, but all power would effectively belong to Seska.

One minor detail that I found interesting - Tuvok was one of the conservative Starfleet officers who opposed Spock's proposed peace with the Klingons in 2293. As he will later share, at that time, he was serving on the Excelsior under Sulu, and he harbored an intense dislike for humans. When Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant, Tuvok was already over a 100 years old. His evolution really is interesting. 

This was a really great episode, and to top it off, it ends with a really inspiring speech from Janeway:

&gt;In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where  shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to  rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Federation.

startrek,"We are about a month away from the twenty-sixth anniversary of *All Good Things*, which first aired twenty-five years after *Turnabout Intruder -* 5/23/94 and 6/3/69 respectively. I know when I was a kid in the nineties (between about five and nine years old), TOS looked pretty hokey at times; I could easily tell it was an old show, from the womens' haircuts, the uniforms, the colors, the blockiness of the consoles and dated special effects and so on. TNG was, by comparison, super slick and brand new, all subdued tones and elegant curved surfaces. I enjoyed them both anyway - I always preferred the movies with the original cast, they just seemed much more human and, ironically, grounded in reality compared to the TNG films. 

Anyway, I assume people still introduce their kids to prior Star Trek, so I was wondering if kids these days see TNG as being just as hokey and outdated to them as the TOS did in our day.

startrek,"To give a little context - about three years ago I decided I wanted to watch Star Trek. I'd grown up with TNG on the television but aside from seeing it on whenever someone else was watching it, I didn't know very much about the over arching story. I spent the next 20 months watching every iteration of Star Trek that was out there. I used to have the dates all saved as to when I started and finished each but it essentially went:

- TOS

- Star Trek Continues (I know its not canon but it was good)

- TNG

- DS9 (my personal favorite)

- VOY

- ENT

- DIS

In between Star Trek Continues and TNG I watched all six movies with the original series cast. After TNG I watched First Contact and Insurrection but somehow missed Nemesis. 

Late Friday I started the first season of Picard. By saturday I'd finished it and frankly I didn't think it was very good but I stuck it out. After it was over I really missed the Picard I grew to know over 7 seasons of TNG. I ended up sitting down and watching a marathon of First Contact, Insurrection and finally Nemesis. 

None of these were exactly fantastic movies by any stretch but they were, in my opinion, far more true to Picard's character than the actual Picard show was. Poor writing and plot aside, Picard's character in 'Picard' just seemed too different. The whole tone of the show was far more Discovery than it was TNG and frankly I think that was part of the problem. I don't dislike DIS (anymore - that first season was hard) but I had high hopes that Picard would be a return to the Trek of old...instead it was more of the same watered down new age Trek that we've seen since the JJ Abbrams movies and Discovery. 

I just miss the hopeful optimism of TNG and Captain Picard. I miss the vaulted speeches where he defends humanity's advancements to John De Lancie (as an example). Picard as a show really missed the point of Picard's character in my opinion and honestly I hope it gets better from here because I feel like it can't get much worse than a crappy French accent and an eye patch.","I ran a marathon yesterday with First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis and it made me really sad about Picard"
startrek,"I've been watching Picard and seen Discovery, but while I like them they don't have the introspection that DS9, TNG, and even Voyager gave. 

Am I the only one feeling this way?

I loved the idea that humanity had progressed to the point where the challenge was to improve one's self. I miss the idealism of the earlier Star Trek, where we get to know the characters intimately and understand their challenges rather than big faceless entities with their corruption and failings etc.

I watched Discovery a couple of months ago and can't actually tell you the names of the characters for the most part. They were forgettable to me since I couldn't empathise with them as people.

Its no secret many Trek fan simply want another show with the values and themes that seem to have been actively ignored/removed - exploration, deep characters, a story without constant betrayal and destruction as themes. None of the forced melodrama, conflict and catering to every modern trope thats the hallmark of JJ era Trek. A story about betterment of humanity.

Of course some people will say its cool, its the same old, that Trek needs to be reinvented. I disagree and so will many. In any case we've now had plenty of new series and movies of nuTrek.

startrek,"I've listened to the Star Trek: The Next Conversation Podcast (hosted by Matt Mira (a huge Star Trek nerd) and Andrew Secunda (a newbie to Trek, other than TOS)).

Based on what they've said about the show, I've no interest in watching Picard. However, my ridiculous headcanon to explain the whole situation that caused the Zhat Vash is that a video game historian/nerd from somewhere in the 30th (or whatever) century went back in time to get the original Mass Effect trilogy for a museum, their personal collection, or something, experienced some catastrophe that sends their ship back in time to Aia and mostly damages the ship such that it's only able to beam bits and pieces of of the games into someone's head as a jumble, mixing the geth and the reapers with information about a &gt;!cyborg tentacled species!&lt; that should be avoided.

startrek,"Fans often talk at length about their favourite captain, but I want to discuss what you think about all of them. What do you like and dislike about them all? 

Here’s mine if anyone is interested. 

Pike
Best: He’s the most human, flawed yet heroic, and the epitome of StarFleet. When I think of a captain I’d like to serve with, it’s him. He’s my favourite.

Worst: Not enough of him.


Kirk
Best: The fact that he often decides what’s moral, rather then going with what’s expected of him. Unlike other captains, he knows that The Federation isn’t perfect and so he bends the letter of the law to do what he thinks is right. He is also a tactical genius, and charismatic as hell.

Worst: Due to sixties writing he can come off as a little emotionless, and sometimes too stern.

Picard
Best: Morally one of the finest officers in the fleet. Probably the most moral captain of all time. 

Worst: He is so goddamn stuffy and up himself. Especially early on. I get people love him a lot and I think he’s a great character, but if I knew him in real life, he’d be the worst boss.

Sisko
Best: I love his backstory and how he is a family man at heart. I love his relationship with the Bajorans, and think he’s a tactical genius. 

Worst: Too militaristic for me. Took too long to find his character. 

Janeway
Best: When written well, she is the paragon of virtue. Kind yet brave, commanding respect without being cruel. Moral without being naive. Also the smartest of all the captains we’ve seen. 

Worst: Unfortunately she was written inconsistently. Sometimes she’d be willing to bend the rules, other times she’d stick to her guns no matter what. Sometimes she was a warm kind person, other times she was cold and stern. 

Archer
Best: I love the flawed perspective of his character. Making him the person to inspire The Federation, he could have been too perfect, instead he was written as flawed and complicated. Sadly his arc was cut short, and we never got to see him at his best. He was also a keen strategist and a willing explorer.

Worst: Like Janeway, he was written inconsistently, although in my opinion less so. He sometimes became cold for no real reason, and other times he seemingly gave up his ethics all together. 


Georgiou and Lorca
I’m including these two together, because to me they’ve both got the exact same flaws and qualities, but for completely opposite reasons.

Best: I immediately want a show for both these characters. They are portrayed by fantastic actors and had a lot of stories to tell. If they were allowed to run their course, they may be in my top rung of captains. 

Worst: They weren’t allowed to run their course. For one reason or another they were both written out of their stories at the earliest possible place and weren’t allowed to evolve. In the case of Lorca, the biggest shame was the end twist. Before that we were given a complex and morally grey man. Sadly that didn’t last, and he was quickly turned into a moustache twirling villain. I didn’t mind the idea, in fact it was very well done, but the final execution wasn’t good enough. Sad.",What Are You’re Thoughts On All The Captains?
startrek,"At least twice the Borg tried to assimilate Earth with only 1 cube (second time with a sphere in it as well) and failed. 

The Borg Queen told 7 of 9 they they wouldn't succeed a 3rd time which is why they wanted to develop another method of assimilation by assimilating them by throwing a nanoprobe virus into the atmosphere which is a method they were developing for ""highly resistant species""

Why not just sent multiple Cubes if they want Earth so badly? They obviously wanted Earth badly enough to go thru the trouble of capturing 7 of 9 to help them in the assimilation so it seems to me like it would be worthy of them to spare a few Cubes for a while away from another task. Seems efficient enough to me and worth it from their perspective

startrek,"So here's a thought experiment, because why not.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would happen if different Star Trek captains, main ones from the shows or maybe others if they are fleshed out enough, found themselves faced with the Deep Space Nine assignment?

I've been pondering this specifically with reference to Deep Space Nine, because in that series the chain of events that unfolds kind of isn't focused on Sisko, he is at the forefront of events and he definitely shapes them, but a lot of what goes on is bigger than him. Theoretically any captain could take that assignment, of course he's the emissary as well, but hypothetically we could assume another captain was a child of the prophets instead.

So what, in you good folks opinion, would happen if for whatever reason Picard had caught the DS9 assignment, or Janeway? Or maybe Riker gets his first command on the station, or some sort of time-skipped Kirk, Archer or Lorca?

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thoughts are:

Picard probably messes it up and the Dominion wins. I could see him handling the Cardassians more effectively, because he's got longstanding beefs there, but I think the Vorta would be able to play him long enough to get a foot in the door and take the Alpha Quadrant. If he got tested the same way that Sisko did to work out his intentions in that simulator the Dominion might be all like, ""Solids are back on the menu boys!"" and just go straight in.

Janeway is plenty ruthless enough to get things done and I suspect that her closer relationship with Starfleet (remember Sisko is about to quit when he takes the job) probably means less guff from Bajoran separatists, more redshirts on the ground of Bajor and more ships at the wormhole on the regular. So I could see things all going pretty stale in that regard, a perpetual standoff.

Kirk flirts with the female changeling and the war is called off.

Lorca lets the Pah-wraiths out and everything goes directly sideways.",How Would Other Captains Have Handled The DS9 Story?
startrek,"While I enjoyed the episode overall (although I don't get why it was so necessary to study the quasar immediately instead of coming back here after delivering the medicine... but whatever) I have to say the ending is really strange.

You know what I'm talking about, the way they all try to make Spock realize he actually acted on emotion instead of pure cold logic for once. They're all having a hoot, laughing and in a really good jolly mood. Immediately after they just lost two crew members who were brutally murdered. Really?   
I feel like the writers must have forgotten about this when writing this ending, that's just nuts.",[TOS] Galileo Seven - small thought on ending
startrek,"A thing I have turning over in my mind a lot is why I don't like new Trek and I think I finally know why. Some Picard season 1 spoilers below. 

The last two seasons of new Star Trek, but also just a lot of science fiction in general, do these ultimate ""all life everywhere at risk"" storylines and it takes all the weight out of a story.

I was listening to the The Greatest Discovery podcast and they were talking about all the ways the themes of Picard season 1 were unfolding and upon re-watching, yeah, I could see all that, but it didn't make me feel anything.

I feel like introducing some kind of universe ending super bad guy robs the story of any weight it could have had. We know they're probably not ending Picard on a note of all organic life is getting destroyed, so the stakes don't feel real. All the best episodes of Star Trek are ones with personal or political stakes, where the outcome is genuinely uncertain. Obviously the format dictates a return to some form of status quo, that's television. But I feel like this kind of ultra high stakes scenario is so cartoonish, _especially_ when it's the kind you can solve by hitting the right button at the last second.

There's a lot of criticism of gritty Trek and that it should be more optimistic and I don't agree with that. Some of the best Trek is about taking a hard look at moral ambiguity, such as the Maquis plotlines in DS9. What I think is missing from modern Trek is the mundane. You could have the same story of Picard season 1 but, in my opinion, many times more effective if everything just happened at a smaller scale. You don't need to invent an extra secret Romulan police, you don't need an AI that will end all organic life, this can be a story about Picard trying to do right by the people he's wronged and about how he misses Data and is forced to contemplate death and age and his own blind idealism. Those are all great themes that the show is tackling. I don't think it needs big AI space worms being summoned through a portal.

This got a little rambly. Anyway. Curious to hear what you all think.",I'm tired of high stakes science fiction.
startrek,"An interesting experience! I watched the season in the space of about a week, so everything was fresh going through. 

It would have been nice if the mycelial realm wasn't a multiverse-ending disaster waiting to happen, as an infinite number of universes will result in one ignoring the warning signs and killing everything. However, I can see it being a multiverse-spanning network essential to their travel to the mirror universe. I enjoyed the references to interphasic space, Defiant, and transporter travel in an ion storm. 

The overshoot on return could have been bigger. I found it disappointing that the Federation could be broken so thoroughly in less than a year. 

Some of Burnham's voiceovers were good, others a little cheesy. Still, an actor can only do so much with their lines and direction. 

Now, I did find mirror Georgiou disappointing. She just hands over the detonator and walks away. Who was Admiral Cornwell's speech for anyway? The bridge crew had to know the real captain was dead and all of them knew of the mirror universe. 

Starfleet resorting to genocide to win the war is...it's not ideal. I would expect more from the Federation. I think if we were in the war longer, seeing the endless grind and loss of system after system, it would have been easier to accept their resorting to genocide. Popping in at the end leaves us too fresh to accept the desperation. 

I don't think L'Rell will have a long-term hold on the Klingon Empire if her only tool is to kill everyone. I'm also deeply surprised that a small Klingon task force in eyesight of Earth (undefended, no Starfleet ships in sight) would turn back when they could claim the honor of desecrating the enemy homeworks. 

Having watched the clip on YouTube back when it first aired, I got very excited when we reached The Scene. Seeing Enterprise and hearing the theme put a massive smile on my face and a thrill in my heart.

However, despite I love the show ideas and the casting, the characters are underdeveloped and underused.

startrek,"i was born about the time enterprise started airing, and i've grown up on star trek. i've never really... liked enterprise, generally, but mom decided to start watching it again and i've half payed attention.

so from what i've seen so far combined with what i remember from way back when, enterprise is darker. it seems like they were more optimistic at first but once the xindi attacked earth, suddenly everyone lost their morals. i understand that the tonal shift of this show is due, in part, to the conditions in which it was created, but i kind of think that's a chump excuse. 

suddenly everything is TV-14, the lighting and the background design is so much more grungey, they oversexualize t'pol way too much (in previous treks yeah they do this but with poor t'pol it's just a bit worse, i think it's cause she's a vulcan, kinda adds salt in the wound), the vulcans are like the jedi council and completely unnappealing with their logic being colored by negativity. also, from what i heard people are kinda upset about the xindi plot altogether and just wanted more romulans. btw, do their uniforms bother anyone else? when you reduce the classic colors down to an accent for another non-neutral color it's just so much more... drab. but i guess that's intentional... :\^ I

startrek,"I know that the writers have already admitted the only reason they created the Queen was because the drones were impersonal and they wanted a tangible antagonist for the audience. 

However, it is completely antithetical to the essence of the Borg that they have a Queen. Therefore, in-universe, it is only possible to make sense of her existence by interpreting her as an aberration. And, when viewed through this lens, it actually makes more sense out of every other appearance of the Borg since First Contact. 

For instance, in this light, the existence of Unimatrix Zero then becomes an autoimmune response to the presence of a free radical in the collective in much the same way that Hugh triggered the events of *Descent.* We see similar phenomena in the episode *Drone*, with the children of the episode *Collective*, and with the events relayed in *Survival Instinct*. And, of course, Patient Zero is Locutus. 

In each incident of errant drones, they are regarded as either anomalies to be re-assimilated or diseases to be purged. Therefore, I conclude that the Queen is simply another unincorporated anomaly that spread out of control and became, in essence, a collective within the Collective. She is not actually ""The Queen"" of The Borg at all; She is a malfunctioning drone.",[Fan Theory Query] The Borg Queen Is A Cancer In The Collective

I guess from a TV production perspective the biggest sticking points would be the makeup budget of having a whole main cast of alien characters. Also the perceived challenge of selling a sci-fi show in which humanity is not the focus.

startrek,"I have no idea if this has been mentioned recently or at all but can anyone tell me how in the hell the transporters are still in use? Between accidentally sending Kirk into the mirror universe, creating two Rikers, sending Sisko back into 2024, and other such mistakes that I don’t remember throughout TNG and at least one or two others in DS9, up until “Past Tense”, it seems like even though they’re rare mistakes the seriousness of them should be something that Starfleet at least looks into. 

Is there any canon material that says Starfleet finds these occurrences within acceptable parameters? Like they’re 100% safe or 99% with some “minor” problems? Is there a transporter manual that gives all the potential dangers of transporting? Can’t transport in an ion storm, there just happens to be a singularity going on somewhere in the system, or other such situations that would be hard to control. 

I feel like Pulaski was well within her rights to distrust transporters. Probably reads all the reports and goes to her supervisor or subordinate and tells them “eh. Told you so. Look at this, sent 200yrs into the past. Never using another one, even after that incident with the genetically altered kids and getting old.”

Total side note the Dax symbiont caught on really quick to the situation and adapted within seconds of waking up. That’s impressive as hell and makes total sense for the character as the symbiont has 8 life times of experience.

startrek,"In VOY: Year of Hell, Part 1, Tom Paris likens the construction of transverse bulkheads throughout Voyager's hull to the watertight bulkheads on the ancient Earth steamship RMS Titanic.

According to Memory Alpha, Year of Hell was filmed in August of 1997, with the scripts presumably being put together just prior. The episode first aired in November 1997.

According to Wikipedia, James Cameron's Titanic began production in 1996, aiming for a July 1997 release date, before eventually slipping to an actual premier in December 1997.

Voyager originally aired on the United Paramount Network (UPN), and Titanic was in part produced and released by Paramount Pictures.

So, two questions:

1. For anyone who watched Year of Hell's initial broadcast: how aware of the Titanic was the general public at this time? As far as I can tell, contemporary common knowledge would mostly have stemmed from the 1958 movie A Night to Remember, and possibly news coverage of Ballard's discovery of the wreckage in 1985. Was this reference to the structural composition of that ship well understood? As someone born in 1993 who didn't start watching Star Trek until 2007, I could so vividly imagine those dramatic watertight door scenes from the film, but I wonder if the same was true prior.

2. Is there any evidence that this was a sly advertisement by Paramount for their major upcoming James Cameron helmed motion picture? Presumably the buzz around the movie would've been out by the beginning of 1997, maybe even a Superbowl commercial, if they we're aiming for a summer release. By the time filming of Year of Hell began in August, the Titanic producers would have committed to the December release, and what better way to entice people to come see your expensive blockbuster than to drop hints into your network shows!

startrek,"V has never been my favorite, nor most people's. But I recently rewatched it with my daughter and I realized that there were a lot of moments that had stuck with me. 

For all the life and death they went through in the other films, some of the most personal moments where in V. It's the only time, that I can recall, that we see the crew on actual out of uniform shore leave. We get to see how they interact with each other when their not on duty or doing anything particularly interesting. 

We learn not only about their families and their losses but how much these experiences effected them personally. When Sybock reveals Spock's pain to him,  Spock's emotional silence is DEVASTATING. All his logic and discipline mean nothing in that moment, and that's what arguing with your brother is like. We learn that they never got over these traumas and probably never will, they just learned to live around them, and they never shared these things with their closest friends. Like real people. 

To this day, when I'm upset about something and someone tries to dismiss it with a platitude, I still remember Kirk saying, ""I don't want my pain taken away from me. I NEED my pain!"" To him, he's not a hero, he's someone who thinks very deeply about pain and loss and death and that's what drives him. He can be cocky and brash on the surface, but underneath he's very aware of the risks he takes. The other movies told us a great deal about WHO Kirk is, I thought V did the best to explain WHY Kirk is.

Now, there's a lot of silliness and schlock, too, so it's still not my favorite. But it got me wondering what might have been. There was a good movie in there somewhere, it just never got finished.",I wish Star Trek V had been more realized.

startrek,"Jake Sisko should have done an investigative report on his fathers actions with the Maquis specifically with regards to the bio bombing of the Maquis colony making it inhabitable to human life and forcing the people living there to mass evacuate with nothing but the clothes on their back. This should have led Jake down a road of further investigating some of his fathers decisions and turning over some very uncomfortable stones. Real Star Trek is a show that displays what intellectual, wise, self actualized adults and societies do to resolve problems in the most humanist/ethical way they can. The themes of the Federation have never been about them or humanity not having problems but how their approach to resolving problems differs from what has been done before without a humanist ideology. Showing how the Federation deals with freedom of the press and a citizens access/right to information was a big missed opportunity.

Next, Captain Sisko should have died with no hint or suggestion of coming back to life or being saved by the Prophets. Arguably DS9's biggest long term theme was ""this is what it takes for the Federation to build and manifest their ideology after the first contact and diplomacy ships leave."" DS9 shows a lot of what it takes including the occasional deaths. Yet none of these deaths have really hit home including Jadzia Dax or Tasha Yar and that's because we know that the actors were leaving the show for personal reasons and it being less about a natural flow of story. But if Sisko really died at the end we would be sitting here and saying DS9 deliberately showed us what kind of hard choices and sacrifices it takes to keep the Federation, this humanist future, going with the lead character of a series. That people (aliens included in that word) may and do die with their eyes wide open to keep the ideology alive because it's a way of life worth preserving and living in not just for oneself but for everyone you love and even those you don't. Instead we are left with this imo completely ""Meh, he'll be back probably..."" ending that to me really doesn't have a lesson or theme to it.",🤔 Two Really Big Missed Opportunities In DS9
startrek,"Hello all, 

I have a dilemma (see captivating title). 13 years ago, when I was a youth, I was a dumb kid (see captivating title). I was entrusted with my aunt’s keys so I could come and go while she was gone. I opted to stay at my boyfriend’s a few nights, and was picked up before she returned. When I gave her keys back, she screamed at me. On her keys, was a Ferengi keychain from Star Trek: The Experience, with Rule of Acquisition #21: “Never place friendship before profit” on it. It was gone. Fallen, no doubt, while I was galavanting around as a careless youth. We searched everywhere. His apartment, the parking lot, all of the grounds. She didn’t speak to me for a week. 
Fast Forward: I’ve been searching for this keychain on and off for years with ZERO luck.  With covid-19 coming around, and my aunt and I now both being healthcare workers, I resumed my search, in hopes to brighten out spirits. My sheer chance, I found a seller on Facebook! He mailed me the keychain for a low price. I was ECSTATIC. Unfortunately, it was premature. I received the envelope, but the corner was torn off, and the product was gone. I made many frantic calls to my post office, his, and mail recovery. They don’t hold on to “trinkets”. I’m devastated, folks. So I’m turning to here. And everywhere. To try to find this damn keychain! I have a picture of it, but I can’t figure out how to get it to post. I can tell you that it’s from Star Trek: The Experience. Round. Ferengi.

startrek,"I get it - Discovery and Picard are intended to draw more casual fans into the show. And while there's plenty of fan service easter eggs throughout both series with great levels of attention to detail, ignoring certain major canon remains an unacceptable oversight.

1. In Picard, no reference was made of Data's first daughter Lal, or his brother Lore. To me, this detracted from the strength of the overall plot and characters. Heck, Lore played a major part of Hugh's experiences in Descent I and II!

2. While Chabon acknowledged the Dominion War behind-the-scenes, no mention of it was made on-screen in Picard which detracts from the the world building as well as Picard's experiences with evacuating the Romulans, standing up for their rights, etc. Not only does it discredit DS9, but in past Trek shows, references to other not-shown wars and events were often made (Earth-Romulan War, Federation-Cardassian War, World War III, Eugenics War, etc.)

I enjoyed every series including Enterprise which was just staring to hit its stride when it was canceled.  I love the original series/crew and movies. I liked the first reboot film of this crew as well and felt they could have built a really cool different legacy in the different timeline but was really disappointed by the 2nd one and very meh in the 3rd.  

Kirks crew were part of my childhood and that crew will always be special for me.  If they don’t come back I’m good with it.  It seems a shame the reboot crew never got the 5 year mission(RIP Anton :( ). 

TNG was also amazing and I consumed all of it, including the movies DS9, Voyager.  Recently I watched Picard, and while it’s not TNG, it was nice to see a post TNG world.  It doesnt have the magic that TNG had, but I like some elements of it very much.  I felt like they should have explored 7 of 9 going to the dark side. That moment got me nerd giddy at the possibility of her as the queen. Maybe something for the future.  Also why waste Hugh?...

I’m also not sure I like the daughter, which makes me sad because Data is one of the greatest characters of all time.  Season 2 will be huge.  For me, it made me appreciate TNG because your exploring the Picard and Data missions that are so important to Picards overall story now.  

Now for Discovery...I’m three episodes in and must say.. What am watching here?  Robots on the bridge in this era?  Mind melds create infinite conversations now at anytime? Mutiny?  Firing first?  Those are Klingons?!  What in the Worf am I watching?

Ok I like some things about the gatherings but why do they all sound like they have congestion?  Why are they all bald now?  They are shiny and sparkly now but they lost all the substance and flavor that was so incredible in TNG and DS9 storylines.  

As far as the new crew, not sure what to think of Michael but she’s growing on me.  The rest of the crew is kinda blah for me.  Nobody stands out as of yet, not even tall dude and I always like Doug Jones.  Not feeling this story either.  Hoping it gets better...

---------------------

Anyway here the rough idea and plot:

It's the mid 25th century. Guinan recognized for her wisdom and good counselling is working at the main Starfleet medical unit for mental health as a therapist (yes she had to get certified still) helping officers with anxiety and other emotional challanges.

Guinan goes home to her condo after work in San Francisco and as she is getting ready to sleep, she gets ""a feeling"" something is in the air. She starts looking around the house and doesn't know what's wrong but she knows something is up. Next thing you know, Q shows up

Q says long time no see. They argue a bit about their past (I won't spoil the details here) and then Q reveals why he's there.

Q says the humans continue to advance faster than any of them thought possible and are crutial for future events in the Universe to unfold as they predict (never explains exactly what it is that humans are supposed to accomplish in the far far future). In the shorter term they are also critical to save the galaxy from a more immediate threat both to themselves and the rest of the Federation and Galaxy, the Borg which remain a powerful foe.

In recent decades the Borg not only fully repaired and restored their transwarp network destroyed by Voyager, but are stronger than ever assimilating the galaxy at a rate like never before and humans with the aid of other species and allies in the powerful Federation are the only species both powerful enough but also adaptable and creative enough with solutions to battle such a foe

Q warns that if humanity is gobbled up by the Borg things will not happen as they must. Q reminds Guinan that she knows very well what's at stake for the Universe (once again Q does not specify what he means, but Guinan seems to know what he's talking about)

Guinan begins to argue that the Q continuum should just do something about it and snap the Borg out of existance despite Qs insistance that his hands are tied and the rules from the continuum do not allow him to simply take such a species out of existance just like that without specific rare reasons and that warning humanity on a need to act on the Borg was his only indirect loophole he could take in their destruction (if not destruction, at least partial suppression, or kept under control)

Q states that the reason he chose to contact her of all people is not only because she now has a career and history with Starfleet as a very trusted member that can relay the message and taken seriously, but Guinan also understands what's fundamentally at stake for the future like no one else in the Federation, tho she cannot reveal everything she knows Q is talking about to Starfleet or the Federation

This story I have in mind would not only involve a lot of battle scenes since it's against the Borg... But the story would reveal a lot of mysteries about what the Q are, and what Guinans species fundamentally are too and what their connection with the Q is as well. 

However some details of the history of the Q and Guinan and the El-Aurians and who they fundamentally are would still remain ambiguous. This story would only be a progression in our understanding of those mysterious beings, and further hints that humanity will one day in the far inconceivable future (like Q once told Riker) will one day be a major race not just in the Galaxy but in the Universe and surpass the Q. However again, it will not ruin what that mystery is because the story will only make ambiguous hints, not actually outright reveal everything.

In it, Janeway opens up a resort simulation with holographic beach goers on the holodeck to lure the macroviruses inside. The macroviruses killed the holographic people. And what's more disturbing is that the Doctor went along with it. Now, I know Janeway did this to save her crew from the macroviruses, but still, if a holographic person is capable of sentience, wouldn't what Janeway did be considered genocide?","In Macrocosm, did Janeway commit genocide?"
startrek,"I just watched Nemesis with my wife a few nights ago. She only like the new Star Trek movies from JJ Abrams. But this one kind of changed her mind. It's in a completely different style than the previous TNG movies.

I'm not gunna lie, I enjoyed it more than First Contact and Insurrection. Although, I'd already seen First Contact when it came out. Insurrection put me to sleep. It was a lot more action packed, but there was some weird immersion breaking stuff.

Like, how did this human clone get so much power? How'd he become a leader of an entire alien race of people in such a short period of time? Why does the slave race, the Remens, have such advanced technology in comparison to the Romulans? Why do the Romulans fear him? Why are the Romulans so nice the the Enterprise at the end?

Then there were smaller issues, like with the star ship battle itself. Yeah, it was cool. It was cool as fuck. However, before Picard rams into the ship he asks if he can concentrate his phasers. Geordi, or someone, say, ""They're shields are at 70%."" If the shields are at 70% Picard would be ramming into the shields. Not the ship itself.",Nemesis impressions

I understand this could just be to keep mystery alive as a plot device but has there ever been an in-universe explanation?

The series follows the crew of the USS Discovery as they encounter new worlds and civilizations, delving into familiar themes and expanding upon an incident that has been talked about within the franchise's universe, but never fully explored.""

Certainly terrorism is a morally complex issue but that’s the whole point of DS9. Condemning Kira just because “she was a terrorist” is really shallow analysis and I’m actually quite surprised at the number of Star Trek DS9 fans who hold that view when the whole point of the show is moral ambiguity. It’s a similar situation with the Maquis: we aren’t supposed to just condemn them out of hand as terrorists and yet that’s the stance people are taking, unhappy that the show seems to be justifying terrorism.

startrek,"S1E9 - Hide and Q

As a preface, I am watching through TNG for the first time and am sharing my running thoughts while watching each episode.

So we start off the episode by learning that the Enterprise is on their way to save 504 severely injured people, and they’re prepared for them all. Holy cow that is just insane to me. I guess I don’t comprehend how large the Enterprise really is. 

Worf pouring out his drink from Q was great. The reasoning was explained as a Klingon code: “Thou shall not drink with thy enemy.” Might have liked it more without the explanation honestly. 

Q’s Penalty Box. Might be a cool name for a bar or maybe a band?

The reason Q goes after Riker instead of Picard is because Q thinks Picard is too competent basically. Riker definitely falls more susceptible to Q’s charm but to be fair his challenge was much more difficult than Picard’s. 

Data once again proved how strong he was when he was tossing cinderblocks like they were foam (which they probably are haha)

Deepest wishes list:

Data - to become human

Wes - to be 10 years older. That’s not what Wil Wheaton looks like irl haha

Geordi - to see. Hey it really is LeVar under that mask!

Worf - wants a Klingon wife. Apparently Klingon sex is crawling?

Riker - wanted Q’s power

All of them rejected these wishes as the human way is to strive for more and earn things themselves. I hate to disagree but I think a lot of people would take their deepest wishes at the snap of a finger. But under those circumstances I can see why they all declined.

The last major battle occurred in 2245 at Donatu V, the battle proved just as inconclusive as the prior three.

startrek,"I've noticed a lot of conflicting love and hate remarks with replicators over the series of Star Trek

I remember in TNG when they were carrying the primative farmers the guy loved the whiskey from the replicator. There have also been other times when they praised the quality of the replicators.

But then have also been many instances where characters showed frustration with replicators and their quality

- Tom Paris on the first episode of Voyager was unimpressed with the quality of the tomato soup

- Deanna Troy did not like the ""nutritionally enhanced"" ice cream and wanted real ice cream

- In the new Star Trek Picard they have consistently jabbed at how the the quality of the taste of replicated food is inferior especially in episode 7 when Picard meets Deanna and Riker on the planet

- I also remember the officer who defected to the Maquis in DS9 (forget his name now) sh*t talking how crappy replicator food was like no tomorrow when they were in the shuttle craft


With all the criticism the replicators have had they have also been hailed at times. Would that be from people that don't know real food just like how some kids these days hail frozen food? I remember loving frozen pizza as a little kid for example until tasting REAL Pizza could it be a simmilar thing? But then again the primative man did love the whiskey

Also the fact that they still farm in the future and Picard grows grapes suggests there has so be some kind of demand for real food. If real food wasn't better why farm at all? Or could it be to conserve power?

 We do know that replicators require A LOT of energy (Voyager often had to ration replicators when power reserves were down even more than holodecks). Could it be challanging to supply billions in a planet with replicated food alone so farming was still required?

So I guess I'm asking 2 questions here. Is their quality truly inferior to real food? and why farm still if food can be replicated? Thoughts",Replicators... Loved Or Hated? Why?
startrek,"I have been a Star Trek Fan since I was 9 years old. It started with my dad whatching Star Trek Voyager which I was instantly hooked on. I rewhatched every re-run of Voyager constantly and years later once streaming online became a thing started whatching it yet again

I did branch out into other Star Treks too. The Next Generation was the second one I whatched which I really liked as well (tho not as much as Voyager at the time), then Star Trek Enterprise when it came out, eventually I gave Deep Space 9 a chance even tho I innitially refused to whatch it finding it boring (I honestly think now its actually my favorite) and I've whatched every movie (all 13 both from TOS and The Next Generation and the new modern ones), and the new series Discovery and Picard (I love Picard btw) but it all started with Voyager

But the last several years I have an ever growing love/hate relationship with Voyager each time I give it a little whatch and now as I got older (I'm turning 27 in a month) because in many ways it seems like the most badly done of all the star treks and I'm sorry but I'm about to go on a rant:

#1 Captain Janeway can't act to save her life. It was especially bad in the first couple seasons. She was very stiff and very extra and her lines seemed so forced. It did get better in the later seasons but only ""acceptable"" she never became great in my opinion

#2 The characters and cast were super dry. Harry Kim, Kes &amp; Chakotay were literally plain dry toast with no personality. Tuvok gets a pass because Vulcans are supposed to be that way but when half the cast is already boring to begin with adding a lifeless Vulcan makes it intolerable. The characters all were overly formal and sounded over rehearsed

The characters that DID have personality often had the other extreme of having too much like they were making up for the lifeless cast. Neelix and the Doctor in particular were way too extra. Between Chakotay, Kes, Harry and Tuvok being too dry, Neelix &amp; the Doctor being too extra, and Captain Janeway being a terrible actress... Tom Paris is the only character I tolerated and Balana Torris and 7 of 9 the only 2 characters I genuinely liked

#3 They constantly threw obvious issues under the rug when they didn't want to deal with it in the plot. As if it wasnt obvious that there's no way for example that the Maquis crew would blend in so nearly perfectly into a Starfleet crew with minimal problems for example. Yeah a couple episodes early on touched on the tension between the crew but they moved on unrealistically quickly from that.

#4 the contradictions never end. Whether it's the limited number of torpedoes they supposibly had never running out despite use all series long without them ever explaining how they overcame the problem of their production, or there being enough deaths over the entire series to kill a limited sized crew that can't be replaced 2 times over. Like come on


It also got on my nerves to see Neelix and Kes so frequently in senior officers meetings. Like why is the Chef/Cook and trainee nurse always there? Just cuz they are part of the main cast doesn't mean u gotta throw them in when it doesn't make sense.

Basically as a huge trekie that first got introduced to the Star Trek Universe (and science fiction in general) thanks to Star Trek Voyager, and considered it my fav show in general, I now consider it one of the weakest if not the most poorly done of all the Star Trek series (excluding obvious shortcoming like TOS graphics of the times obviously)

Still, a couple of things:

1) Didn't Kes tell them what the frequency was? I know she did as she moved backwards in time, but surely she would have told them as she started moving forwards. Yes. I know they said certain things should not be disclosed, but why would they not disclose the frequency of the torpedo?

2) Obviously there was a change in that now it was Seven that finally found the frequency and not Kes... I guess this is just showing different possible timelines.","Voyager ""The Year of Hell"""
startrek,"
There is a major difference between DS9’s darkness and Discovery’s/Picard’s darkness. DS9 treated its serious topics seriously. During that episode where Obrian was implanted with fake memories, O’Brien’s experience as a prisoner is taken seriously, and his prison lifestyle, his increased agitation and his inability to change or move on nearly makes him commit suicide. All of this is taken seriously. When Nog came back after loosing his leg at the siege of AR-558, he essentially had PTSD, and sealed himself away in a holosuite with Fontaine to get away from everything. The topic isn’t joked about, glorified, or just used casually, it is a serious matter taken seriously by the show. Speaking of, the Siege of AR-558 isn’t some Vietnam war movie, where their mowing down the Vietcong with a machine gun mounted to a Huey. It is a horrible thing, where people die, where Nog, a person close to being a child, loses his leg. It’s dirty, it’s grim, it’s dark, but most importantly it was serious. In fact, Star trek’s worst episodes were when they didn’t take topics or themselves seriously, take Profit and Lace, Code of honor, etc.

Nutrek however doesn’t take anything seriously. Suicide is just referenced casually(“why didn’t I just put a phaser to my head and end it all?”-Seven of Nine “I think about suicide every day”-Agnes and I think there are at least three scenes of suicide). While you would think ptsd would be taken seriously, notably Picard’s with the borg, its forgotten about after a few minutes. If modern producers made DS9, we would have seen a 2 minute scene of Bashir fucking butchering Nogs leg and then another two minute scene of the fake leg being shoved up the gored leg, but since the show was mature, it didn’t glorify violence. DS9 didn’t want violence to happen, it was still Star Trek, when battles were shown it was a struggle and during Sacrifice of angels, getting back DS9 was almost a phyrric victory, and when they finally won and were on Cardasia, only Martok drank, while Sisko(who would have, out of anyone, a justifiable hatred for Cardasians) says, “That May be the case, but that does not mean I have to toast over their dead bodies.” Meanwhile in Discovery, “I want to here you scream”. When DS9 talked about means to an end, such as in the pale moonlight, the entire episode is devoted to the topic. It deals with the struggle of the people involved and the sacrifices you have to make to save lives, even if they seem immoral. Discovery went, “ACTION! IM GONNA FUCKING STAB YOU, FUCK YOOOOOOOU” and then realized they needed to have a, “moral dilemma” so they placed a bomb on Qo’noS and then had Michael go, “we cAn’T BloW UP ThE planeT, tHERE’s liKe, PeOplE HEre anD StuFf.” It makes me sad to see that something made by Seth Macfarland takes more seriousness than an official Star Trek production.",Why darkness worked in DS9 and why I’m sick of hearing it as an excuse
startrek,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Star Trek Picard and the Star Trek fandom as a whole a lot lately, and I realized that so many feel that they either have to love something unconditionally or hate it. As a life long Star Trek fan, I’m only a teen but my dad got me started on TNG when I was 4/5, I really liked Star Trek Picard. It did have two outstanding flaws in my opinion, however. 

Flaw 1 is simpler to explain, the show was just paced extremely weird, the first 3 episodes felt like they could fit into one, yet later episodes felt like they would benefit from being allocated more time. Using extra time gained from tinkering the pacing could be used to insert some more Trekky character moments that a lot of people, including my self, want. 

Flaw 2 is more broad. There were a lot of really, really, really, really stupid decisions. These decisions didn’t have much of an impact on story imo, but just generally felt out of place. Examples of these for me would be the overabundance of Disco style shuttles, the copy paste fleet in the Finale, the death of Hugh, the overly grotesque Icheb scene, etc. As I said, these don’t really impact the story, and some, for me the Icheb scene, didn’t strike me as all that bad, but looking back on these areas, it seems like they were either just lazy and asking for backlash. 

Overall, however, I liked Picard and like New Star Trek as a whole. I just hope future series put some work into the whole pacing thing and I really think Picard going forward and Disco going forward may begin to compare to some of the greatest sci fi ahows(DS9, Babylon 5, and the new Battlestar)",My take on Picard.

So my question comes from what I'm familiar with from TNG to DS9 since that is what I saw when I was a child (tells you my age). Is it possible that V'Ger possibly created or encountered the Borg before it's contact with Kirk and company?

startrek,"I haven't thought through all the details but I was thinking about something with the best of both worlds so how about something that really pushes the boundaries of interstellar travel - some sort of huge starship which is a cross federation crew and science mission to go much further than ever before - perhaps to try to plant transwarp conduits, but the key is to go far further outside of the space we have ever seen before, something truly weird and alien that really requires a show of the scope of the sheer size of space. A multi species crew, an enterprise-y set up but a travelling ship of new design that is almost as much a travelling space station as it is a ship that can be part home, part factory, part base for scout ships - perhaps it's even longer, a ten year mission - something that really evokes going into the unknown like the Apollo program - but to add contrast you also have b plots set in the closer to home areas on earth or thereabouts dealing with federation politics and research and so on that can involve returning characters and smaller b plots. Perhaps the base station that is running the mission, geordi la forge and miles o Brien are running the program from earth, problems have to be solved from a distance like a mission control, and human stories as earth advances with other programs and politics. Haven't thought much more but any ideas to flesh it out welcome. Partly inspired by a pic I saw of a huge fantasy starship with a a saucer but just a huge block behind that felt like it could be some sort of huge monolithic Starfleet design. I might try sketching what I'm talking about to make it clearer.",Series Idea: a new five year mission and a home mission in parallel
startrek,"Odd watch order I know, but I went DS9 then Voyager, then TNG. When I was looking to get into it I was unsure and sometime asked for my likes and told me DS9 would be the best if I was only going to watch one. 

I liked TNG, but I think it's my least favorite out of what I've watched. Nevermind it's better than Voyager. But I really didn't feel the same connection like I did to DS9, or even parts of Voyager. DS9 has the best characters, and I like the breaks from episodic story telling. In terms of characters I respect Picard, I would love working for him, butb that's about it. Riker was ok. Jordi was meh, same for troi, and Beverly. Data was great, so was worf. And I liked ro laren, huge missed opportunity to put her on Voyager. Maybe because I watched what happened after TNG, and how they built on it is why it didn't hold the same feeling as DS9. Anyone else feel the same way, or is this sort of like trying to say fallout new Vegas isn't the best fallout?",Just finished watching TNG for the first time. My thoughts.
startrek,"Noob Trek 46 - A Piece Of The Action

My first thought was ""what a weird title"". It was evocative of nothing without any context, and I knew nothing about this episode going in.

And I'm glad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times and I mean that in a good way. After episodes like I Mudd, I thought I'd seen it all but this was another delightful curveball I never saw coming. Man, ANYTHING can happen on this show can't it?

Right away something's off when Kirk's asked to meet Okmyx (whose name I originally misheard as Ox Mix, which was interesting) by the ""yellow fire plug"". The contrast in tech between the Enterprise and the Ioatians is funny off the bat. And then bam, we're in a 1930's gangster film (though there's a lot of influences from 30s/40s crime cinema, Little Caesar seems to be a particular reference here.) And it's a great job too, with the thug actors hamming it up, and drivebys, fistfights, cards, even some molls. Integrating the sci-fi elements with this would seem to be a tall order, but it's an ingenious and really interesting premise - a starship crew left behind a book on earth history dealing with the Chicago mob era, the primitive locals became fascinated with it as an artifact of an advanced race, and modeled their civilization on it, it becomes their bible as McCoy says.

Anthony Caruso does a great job as crime boss Okmyx, but it kept bugging me - I'm sure I've seen him before, the name/face is familiar but I can't place it. Little touches, such as how the Federation are referred to ""the feds"" are hilarious . The sets are particularly good, and as a pinball nut I appreciated how they have some oldtime pinball machines in the gangster's rec room. When Kirk plays Calvinball with the cards appears to be when the episode just full on embraces the silliness and becomes an outright comedy. On the one hand I was a little miffed at the potentially serious side of the story which illustrates the importance of the prime directive being forgotten, but what we get is funny enough that I forgive it.

""What are the odds of getting a royal fizbin?""

""I've never computed them captain.""

Elements such as Jojo Krako's ""boss"" plaque and his dartboard of Okmyx make it clear that the show is in on the joke. I was laughing out loud when Spock and Kirk make the scene fully decked out as gangsters, and it's side splitting how ""Koik"" gradually turns into Edward G Robinson with ""Spocko"" reluctantly getting on the act (""I advise yas to keep diallin'"") and I was rolling in the aisles when he accidentally sends the car into reverse. It's great that legendary starship captain James T Kirk doesn't know how to drive. Even Scotty gets to threaten to put someone in concrete galoshes. Things just get nuttier and nuttier in this one.

The coda at the end of the episode even ties up the loose ends, as I was just thinking that how Kirk left things was irresponsible. I'm cutting myself short here - there's lots of other fun little moments I could type up but I won't be able to do them justice. A really pleasant surprise - when I realised what this episode was doing I was afraid it was going to be embarrassing but I couldn't have been more wrong. One of the funniest episodes yet that really blows open the parameters of what this show is ""allowed"" to do.","""A Piece Of The Action"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
startrek,"S1E8 - The Battle

We see the return of the Ferengi in this episode. Our first repeat alien species. Let’s dig in!

So Daimon Bok is immediately untrustworthy and yet they invite him on their ship. Isn’t there some sort of captain’s videoconferencing they can do? Social distancing, people!

We learned that the common cold has been cured. Their medical practices are obviously incredible if Dr. Crusher is so concerned about a headache. 

Captain Picard’s old ship, the Stargazer, was introduced to us. Apparently he destroyed a Ferengi ship with it after it attacked him. The truth of what actually happened at this battle is the mystery of the whole episode, which never really resolved. We are made to assume that Picard was defending the ship. 

So Wes took one look at a brain scan which he admittedly knows nothing about, and he recognizes it as the Ferengi message. That’s a stretch. They would have been absolutely destroyed by Picard in the Stargazer had Wesley not figured that out too.

startrek,"\*Spoiler for the Motion Picture\*

I just saw Star trek The Motion Picture, which I tremendously enjoyed, it's like a short story by Asimov (reminds me a bit of ""The Last Question""), the pacing drags a bit in the beginning, the film could do with 10 or 20 minutes less, but overall it was great. I'm just left wondering, could what the new species that Decker and Vger turn into at the end of the film, be the Q continuum? The Q did say they once were like humans, they see to know everything, just like Vger, and Spock even says at the end that the last thing Vger learned was emotions, the Q with all their superiority seem to be highly emotional beings, heck, they even look human. I know it's probably not the intention, and there might be an official source explaining where the Q came from and what happened to VGER, but I like to believe they are the same species.

All that with its fair portion of excitement and drama, because Picard wouldn't want it any other way. He lives his personal paradise inside the nexus.

Ok so I think I just have to share a bit of my thoughts and confusions

- I ended on the original series, now I liked the ending but it didn't really feel like a finale it felt more of just a normal episode which is wierd

- everyone I know that has watched a lot of star trek and I am just curious why most people don't like enterprise, like it's not my favorite or anything but I enjoyed it but most people seem to just be content with it and I can't seem to figure out why

- I think Voyager might have been my favorite but I don't know for sure I really liked them all

- the ending of Voyager was very strange as they got back to earth and that was it and the show ended right then and there with no like epilogue I guess, like what happened to everyone?

- I really liked ds9 as it felt different since it was on a station instead of a ship

- I have absolutely no complaints about TNG I really enjoyed it but it didn't seem to have a big overarching story that was shown a lot (I like big stories because they make me feel like there is something being built up to like I'm Voyager) but I did like all the episodes by themselves and it seems like a great show to just turn on anytime on any episode and pick up in the plot easily

- I doubt there is an explanation for this but why did kayless in the original series show up as a genetically altered Klingon?

Ok I have more thoughts that I can't think of as I am bad at writing my opinions well, I haven't been on this sub long so I don't know if is should make a post like this. Also I wierd thing I noticed was that all of these shows were aired before I was born except near the end of Enterprise (I'm only 15)

startrek,"Noob Trek 44 - The Trouble With Tribbles

I know this episode! At least I know it's premise. I don't know \*how\* I know this - I've certainly never seen it before as I had seen no Trek before beginning this marathon - but I knew the basic story before watching it, that the Enterprise becomes overrun with a bunch of seemingly harmless fluffballs called Tribbles that breed lightning fast. Racking my brain, I \*think\* I'm aware of this because I was a huge fan of Gremlins, and this was cited as an influence on that.

I love the misdirection at the beginning. This entire episode is a bait and switch - we're lead to expect a confrontation with the klingons, with a whole bunch of politics and protocol and posturing upfront. Kind of like I Mudd, which has a dry opening before becoming very silly indeed, this also goes for a gradual and entirely deliberate 180 in tone. The gag is of course that the silly little tribbles come closer to causing mission failure on the part of Kirk than the aggressive warlike Klingons ever have. The I Mudd comparisons are Apt - this in fact feels like a Mudd episode. I wouldn't be surprised if it was written as one and Carmel was unavailable or something, Cyrano feels like a Mudd stand in. I don't mind Stanley Adamas as Cyrano, he's fine, and does well in the bar fight scene as he amusingly enjoys his drinks while everything goes to hell around him, but I think Carmel might have done it even better.

I recognize Trelane, William Campbell from Squire Of Gothos immediately. Much as I like Campbell though, he feels miscast as a Klington, much too arch and spry. It would have been nice to bring back Kor from Errand Of Mercy and have Kor and Mudd team up and possibly have their own spin off together. In fact, to my surprise, the Klingons seem to be getting \*less\* like the klingons I know with each appearance. In Errand Of Mercy they had makeup and more of a sense of an alien culture, in Friday's Child they just looked like people and now in The Trouble With Tribbles they look like people and behave a lot like them too. I suppose the lack of makeup is actually a plot point here for Darvin to pass as a human, but still, I like my Klingons like I like my coffee - not closely resembling a human being.

This episode is absolutely packed with quotable lines, so many I don't think I can even list them all.  ""My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee"" stands out. A lot of them come from Kirk squaring off with Baris - something about Baris just rubs Kirk the wrong way - maybe because he's a bureaucrat who doesn't appreciate the military wing of Starfleet and thinks it is just there to serve him. In any event, Kirk suddenly transforms into a class clown, firing off zingers every time Baris appears on the screen. Kirk doesn't have all the laughs though, one of my favourite moments was Spock boasting of how Vulcans are immune to the charms of tribbles as he begins to stroke one. I also loved how Scotty didn't mind all the insults about Kirk, but as soon as someone has a go at his ship he's ready to fight. ""I'm sorry, the Enterprise shouldn't tow garbage, it should be towed as garbage"" was pretty good too. This also leads into the interesting sight of Kirk dressing down his men for a ""small disturbance"" and leads into this classic exchange:

Scotty: They said you were an overbearing swaggering dictator with illusions of godhood.

Kirk: Is that all?

Other favourite moments are Kirk sitting on the tribble in his command chair, and of course what I now know to the iconic scene of Kirk becoming buried in tribbles. It's not dwelt on as this is a humorous story, but it was nice to see a serious side brought in, as there are ecological undercurrents to Spock explaining to Cyrano the dangers of removing animals from their natural habitats. If Spock is correct though, that means the tribbles live on a badass planet where they get killed all the time - do we ever go there?

Gripes? No shot of Campbell on the klingon ship overrun with tribbles, boo, I really wanted that. Also it's a bit slow - things like the barfight and dressing down, while entertaining, seemed to run long and there wasn't as much tribble insanity as I wanted - this may be due to the tribbles needing to be stationary for production reasons, so when they're just lying there they can't do that much. Finally, is Baris right? Didn't Kirk actually goof up by letting grain get destroyed? That it's poisoned is beside the point, Kirk still failed to defend it despite him knowing that tribbles were about.

However, I still really liked it, plenty of laugh out loud moments, and unlike I Mudd which was just nuts, this has a decent stab at combining a regular, sober Star Trek setting/story with the wacky hi-jinks, giving it a different sort of flavour which I appreciated. I hope we see the tribbles again soon!","""The Trouble With Tribbles"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
startrek,"I mean they literally send the Enterprise to negotiate every dispute at the neutral zone, even though any one of them could result in a full scale war. How incompetent can Starfleet be? Yeah it's the most advanced ship but they're putting families and children in unnecessary danger. I know a lot of the plotholes with regards to this have been pointed out before and most are chalked up to Starfleet's hubris, but there's a fine line between hubris and utter idiocy and Starfleet must have discovered transwarp a couple years early to get as far past that line as they did. It also reflects really poorly on the crew.


For example in the Descent two patter Beverly acting as captain flys the Enterprise into a sun, A SUN! Without knowing if the expirimental shielding will hold, it's okay to take a risk like this if your on a ship with your own crew, but if there are children aboard with their families, it's the type of risk you shouldn't really be taking.


I just needed to get this off my chest. I know the writers have said that they regret that aspect of the Enterprise D but damn, they basically avoid the semantics of it in every episode until they decide they need it as a plot device.


Thinking about this does however add a lot of weight to some of the decisions made in the show. For example at the end of 'Best of Both Worlds', right before Data is about to free Picard from the Collective, Riker is about to warp the Enterprise into the Borg Cube to ensure the safety of humanity. It seems like this really big decision when you realise he's about to sacrifice his whole crew to save humanity. But it shows he's got some iron clad balls when you realise he's about to sacrifice every innocent civilian on the Enterprise and in the circumstances its unfortunately probably the right decision.

""Who Watches the Watchers"" is becoming one of my favorite episodes; I find the scenes between Picard and Nuria very moving. The plot bears some thematic similarity to the poignance of Galaxy Quest.

&amp;nbsp;

On my most recent watch, I noticed that there are a few strange parallels between Ray Wise's character, Liko, and his character on Twin Peaks, Leland Palmer. Beyond the minor sound-similarity of the names, both characters interact with otherworldly beings and experience inexplicable and seemingly supernatural events, which change their lives and make them stand apart in their communities. Liko's only relative is his daughter, and he mourns his late wife, obsessing over Picard's power to revive the dead, while Leland obsessively mourns his dead daughter. What's more, in TNG there's a lot of hubbub about the stranded anthropologist, ""Palmer,"" (cf. the Palmer family) whom Liko heard Picard mention in his experience in Enterprise sickbay.

The episode aired on October 6th, 1989. Twin Peaks premiered on April 8th, 1990.

startrek,"S1E7 - Justice

I thought this episode was sort of boring. Not too much happened. But let’s get to it. 

If a world or situation seems too good to be true, it probably is. Thankfully Picard seemed aware of that right off the bat when dealing with Edo. 

There was a lot of discussion about the Edo people including their social practices but they left out the most important thing somehow in their studies because they didn’t learn about their punishment? It doesn’t really make sense that they wouldn’t know about their capital punishment policy. Also they were talking about sexual these Edo people are and yet they still send Wesley who is immediately overwhelmed and gets himself in trouble.

What are the benefits to their idea that any one who commits any crime is executed? Well it saves costs on the justice system and prisons I suppose. Edo’s entire justice system is apparently two Mediators running up to you and slipping you some night-night juice. Quick and easy. On the downside, it’s incredibly unfair. 

That had to be quite the amazing experience for the girl from Edo to be able to see her God up close. I’m surprised she was even able to speak. 

Also I had an alternative solution for the Enterprise to use. Why not dress up one of crew as their “God” in human form. Maybe Geordi in disguise could do this. Then just beam him down and demand the release of Wes?

I feel the writers I had never seen star trek or didnt care for its lore as they changed everything.  There was heavy substance abuse, characters completely change and Picard kind of acted as a push over.  sevens  character specifically was drastically changed and turned into a lesbian all the sudden.  Agnes was hard to watch and always was staring off to space and I am not even sure why Raffi was there.

startrek,"Even though I’m new to the universe I’ve heard at or around 4 is when the show really kicks in to gear. But honestly what the actual f*** is going on before then? TNG had a reason for not being serialized and I suppose at least in the beginning DS9 needed to get everything set up before but by mid season 2 we know the characters and what’s going on. So WHAT THE F*** IS GOING ON?! 

Just watched episodes 14-16 of season 2 and they’re so disconnected and leave so many questions unanswered that I feel are kinda important to the story or at least to character development. 14 is when Bashir and O’Brian are supposedly killed in a planets attempt to stop civil war and they know about some bioweapon. 15 is when O’Brian is running from the station because everyone is acting weird. And 16 I’m in the middle of but just from the first few minutes I’m once again just like what the hell! 

Are the people from episode 14 coming back since Bashir and Brian were rescued by Sisko? They were adamant on killing them, even Sisko, because they know too much. Would they attack the station and start a war with the federation?

Episode 15 who are the Paradons, sorry if that’s spelled wrong, and how did Brian end up with the rebels? What happened when he was with the actual government? What are the rebels rebelling against? Were they negotiating peace with the rebels or another species? What about the rebels makes them more appropriate allies than the government? 

Episode 16 they just ignore everything that happened in the previous ones. Sure the Brian in the last episode was a “replicant” so anything that happened that we saw was not the actual perspective but still it seemed like everyone was against Brian and then boom this episode everything is just fine. 

I get it I do, none of that happened, and with the benefit of Netflix we don’t need to wait a week and that means no real disconnect that didn’t exist when the episode released. It’s still just so frustrating. We’re just supposed to accept that everything happened but also has no lasting impact on anything or anyone. 

Also one of the main criticisms I have for TNG where something happens then next episode it doesn’t matter, I.e. Lal Data’s daughter existing one episode then the next episode no one seems to care or mention her again except maybe once later in the shows seasons.",Frustrating discussion on DS9

All that would of had to happen is the doctor instantly getting to work to keep them all from mutating. But is that really all thy hard? It seems clear in the episode that the longer you wait to treat it the more effort it takes but it’s never impossible. And once they are safe in earth orbit they can use the dozens of ship warp cores to quickly treat everyone and then there’s nothing else to worry about it.  So i see no reason why they wouldn’t use it if it works.,Why wasent warp 10 a usable way home for voyager?
startrek,"Picard season one was, in my opinion, pretty damn good. My only complaint with it would be just how focused it was on the concept of AI, while I agree that AI is something that people need to start talking about  the story itself wasn’t very Star Trek centric and I don’t feel that it properly explored Star Treks vast pre-existing universe. I don’t mind pre-existing lore not being the center of a Star Trek Story as I don’t think Star Trek should be an exclusionary lore circle-jerk, but I do want to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe. 


With Picard de-canonizing almost all of the lore for what’s happened after nemesis by its very nature, I’d love to get to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe, particularly what’s going on with some of the DS9 centric powers. I’d love to get to see Star Trek Picard season 2 show us a Bajor that’s either parted ways with the federation or straight out joined it, or a democratic Cardassia. What about the rest of the Romulan people, obviously some sort of government exists if the tal-shiar and Zhat-Vash still exist, what’s that like?

startrek,"The original series is my second favourite, next to TNG, but it does get a lot of flack for its overly-dramatic acting and a good deal of 'camp'.   
&amp;nbsp;  
William Shatner has been the butt of many jokes over the years, and has gained.. a.. certain reputation........ for his style, but look at the era and his background.   
&amp;nbsp;  
TOS was hot off the heals of so many classic dramatic and adventure films, and seems to have taken inspiration from a lot of the myth and epic movies before it, like *Jason and the Argonauts*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Hercules*.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Now when people ask me about Star Trek recommendations, I always tell them to imagine it is a stage play. This seems to contextualize the exaggerated acting and situations that seem a little more unorthodox, even for a Trek series (like actually meeting the Greek gods).    
&amp;nbsp;  
Not that it should matter, but this approach has really seemed to gain the series some respect, from *my* friends at least.

startrek,"Sometimes I get the sense that Q is always behind the scenes, kind of taking care of Picard or guiding him towards his destiny, or perhaps being the architect.

In season 6 episode 15, Picard is mortally wounded and would have most likely died, but Q intervenes and uses the moment to teach him a lesson and open his mind (by creating the time paradox), just like he tries to open his mind in the show finale. If Q had not sent Picard back in time in that moment, we already know that Picard would have lived a much less exciting life, he was only propelled into his destiny as a legendary captain because of Q's intervention. Plus Q probably made sure he didn't die from that blast as well.

Some interesting character development in this episode. I’m looking forward to these more and more every day. 

Worf showed himself to be eager to learn when he was shadowing Geordi. Seems like he’s ambitious. He’s currently a Junior Lieutenant. We shall watch his career with great interest.  

We discovered that the Enterprise crew does not eat meat! I suppose that makes sense. Where would they keep the animals? Also on the topic of food, it was interesting to hear discussion about accommodating dietary requirements for the aliens that are visiting your ship. 

When the ship ‘malfunctioned’, Data says it’s a near impossible chance of this happening (from normal wear and tear). Good to know how good Star Fleet engineering is. Systems just do not fail on their own. 

As I side note I really liked the design of the Anticans. Haven’t seen them before. 

The discussion about private eyes and detective work was fun. Each episode of Star Trek is a mystery! That’s part of why we all tune in. Also Detective Data is my favorite Data so far. 

I can’t believe they killed off Singh in Engineering! Farewell, our plot necessary casualty. We knew you but for a minute. 

When Picard was controlled by the alien force, he said: “The search for knowledge is always our primary mission”. Based on last episode where he decided to get home rather than explore, that was definitely a clue that he wasn’t himself.",Star Trek TNG S1E6 Discussion

Worf taking away Kurn's identity and memory was an awful way for that storyline to end, imo. Not only was it not honorable, it was basically saying that there was no way for Kurn to get out of his current predicament, which I feel was a bad message.

startrek," Full spoilers ahead for Picard.

They had five full movies worth of run time for Picard and I don't think they satisfyingly developed a single character in this supposedly character driven show. Narek and Soji bang within about five minutes of meeting on the cube and despite liking to have sex with each other being just about all they seem to have in common, I guess Narek loves her by episode five which couldn't be more than a couple of weeks in their time assuming the first time we see Soji at the end of episode one is when Picard sets off to find her.

How they introduced Raffi feels a lot like how Mr Poopeybutthole is shown to apparently have been a real character that participated in past events in Rick and Morty. I get that it makes sense that there would be people Picard would have met in the past couple of decades, but that level of chuminess and amount of inferred history really felt awkward to me for a character we'd never seen before. That quickly glossed over backstory coupled with how quickly they also introduce Raffi's son and move past it and then her very sudden apparent relationship with 7 makes it feel almost like parody levels of ridiculous.

The evil Soji/Dajh character at the end with the Data skin I felt must have had about ten total minutes of screen time(maybe it was more, I think my eyes glazed over and I lost all sense of reality at multiple points watching this show) and yet she ends up being one of the most important antagonists. These synthetics are apparently insanely intelligent and her most of all considering she just randomly deduced that the warning to biological organisms might actually be a message to synthetics and had the ability to mind meld, but she wasn't smart enough to avoid being recorded stabbing her sister.

Agnes is so affected by what she saw through the mind meld that she murders the person she loves most in this world and then later in the series gambles that the synthetics will do the right thing and not genocide all life in the galaxy and helps to save them instead. I guess you could say her speaking to Soji for five minutes that one time could've helped change her mind, but it still seems strange that a character would do such a distinct 180.

There's hardly a real arc for anyone and what arcs there are make little sense or I just find fairly boring. Soji, a few days after finding out she's an android, wants to bring about armageddon for organic life, but then decides not to because I guess Picard was cool to her. Agnes flip flops like I mentioned before between being horrified enough to murder and then potentially making that murder pointless a few days later. Rios is depressed about the incident with the other synthetics and his captain's suicide and then I guess gets over it? No one else really has a significant arc of any kind that I can remember. Elnor starts off as a comic relief ninja and ends that way. 7 starts off as a now nihilistically mooded fanservice Mary Sue and ends that way. Narissa starts off as the wicked witch of the cube and ends that way(well she ends up supposedly dead, but she'll probably be back in season 2 considering we don't see her die as far as I remember). I guess Picard learned to express himself more?

I understand full well why people here really want to like this show. I very much wanted to as well and really did try up until a little past halfway through and while there are technical aspects to like(minus the stock footage), I don't see how anyone can really claim that the creators of this series had a firm grasp on what people want out of Star Trek or competent storytelling in general. Now I expect very much to get flamed here because I know people here did genuinely enjoy this first season and are getting really tired of people like me, and so I just ask that you tell me what it is that you enjoyed about it if you're in that camp. It might be that in a few years I look back and think I was too harsh on the show.

It could be something as simple as some Starfleet officer designing a new uniform that people like, but is there a reason beyond that?

I enjoyed this episode! It gave us more good development, an intriguing storyline and some philosophy. Let’s dig in. 

Kosinski keeps saying he’s got everything approved from star fleet commmand. Is there no way for the Enterprise to verify that? Who does the Enterprise get their orders from?

Last episode we Geordi so excited to go Warp 9, which made me think it was the fastest the ship could go. Turns out it wasn’t. They broke the all-time speed record by going “over warp 10”. It feels nice to witness some Star Trek history. 

There was some interesting philosophical discussions about time, space, and thought all being the same thing. It’s an interesting concept that I can’t say I’ve thought of before. Only issue is space is tangible. We’ve been there. It’s unlike the other two in that way. Not sure where I’m going with that, but there’s a discussion in there somewhere. 

We got shown more of Yar’s rape gang backstory. Apparently she stopped for a cat while running from one of those gangs? I mean, okay? On the flip side there was a nice moment with Picard and his mom. It seemed like they had a good relationship. 

There was certainly an urge at first to explore but I thought Picard shut it down perfectly and logically. The interaction was something along the lines of: “So many opportunities for new studies!” “But who would we report our findings to?”

I really liked how they handled Wesley’s promotion. Having the alien tell Picard he really is a savant but that he needs time to learn is a solid way to justify promoting such a young kid. So now we have Wesley, Acting Ensign, who has an opportunity to become permanent, which is cool. 

Felt like the overall theme of the episode was that when we all work together towards a common goal we can break records. We can accomplish great things as a team.

This is one of the few VOY episodes I can remember that actually has any moral complexity. We've seen a lot of variations of 'shipwrecked survivors found stranded on a planet' in Star Trek, but them being ex-Borg is a nice touch. 

The Cooperative puppeteer Chakotay to go to the damaged Borg cube and restart their link. They violate his autonomy; however, it could be argued it was an extreme circumstance as their rivals were literally beating down their doors to kill them.

On the other hand, Janeway has some good points about why they shouldn't assist the Cooperative in their plans. Firstly, assisting ex-Borg to form their own collective is just hinky. There is no indication that the other stranded ex-Borg on the planet even wanted to collectivize. Then again, if they don't, they all seem hellbent on destroying one another. Janeway's point about the restarted Borg cube possibly summoning other Borg cubes is a good point; one can only hope the Cooperative was able to block the Borg on it from signalling the other Borg. I mean, we have no proof they can do that, but maybe? Otherwise, all they would've accomplished was to bring the Borg right back to them, so I suppose they had thought of that and had a way to stop those Borg.

Also, exploding the Borg cube is basically murder, especially as we know those drones could be disconnected from the collective and reestablish their own identities, just like the colonists on the planet. However, it's arguably necessary to destroy them to prevent them from assimilating and/or destroying Voyager and the colonists.

It would be interesting to see what became of this Cooperative. If they make it to a second generation (and I don't see why not; there's an episode where the Doctor notes Seven is still fertile, implying the Borg don't sterilize their drones) their children won't have the implants necessary for the link. Will they still maintain their idyllic little hippie oneness colony? 

Out of the aliens in the episode, aside from Orum (Romulan) and Frazier (human), one of the Cooperative has facial ridges just like Archer's great-granddaughter in that ""E2"" episode. Is she Ikaaran? One of the attackers seems to be a Nausicaan. The others may be exotic Delta Quadrant species I'm unfamiliar with.","VOY: ""Unity"""
startrek,"For starters I’ll just say this might become quite a long post, and I know the new films are incredibly divisive, but that just means you get a better debate and comparing of ideas out of them so I’m looking forward to the comments on this and what thoughts people have on them.

Anyway, Picard has got me in a very Trek-y mood lately so I’ve been watching all the movies, most are re-watches but a couple for the first time. Naturally I ended up at what I’ll call the Kelvin films. I was born in 98 so these are the only Trek movies I was able to watch at the cinema, but I’m a big Trek fan and have been for as long as I can remember. 

I’m just going to say now I really like Star Trek 09 and Star Trek Beyond. Trek 09 was a really clever way to re-tell the story of the original crew of the Enterprise and the way it doesn’t obliterate the entire cannon by just starting again was a good choice on its part. (I know it does start most things over again but it’s an alternate realty so you get my point) And as for Beyond, I think I can honestly say it’s tied with First Contact for my favourite Trek movie. You can feel the love Simon Pegg has for it in his script and it just feels the most like Star Trek out of the new batch. It’s one of what I call my ‘happy films’. I just bloody love it. 

But man, Into Darkness...exists, I guess.

The 09 movie went so far out of its way to separate itself from Trek stories that had already been told just for them to come back to Khan. I guess at the very least we have something to point to as the moment JJ Abrams started remaking old movies instead of thinking up new ideas, because he did exactly the same with the Star Wars sequels. I know Khan is probably Trek’s most well known villain, but he’s by far the weakest part of this film. 

I’ll give the movie this, the morally grey stuff between Kirk, Marcus and Khan is good. I really enjoy a bit of throwing morally grey stuff into things, it just makes them a lot more interesting. But the rest of the film is average at best and it’s the only one of the new batch that I tend to agree with people who have more negative views of them. It’s such a lazy retelling and all of the tension between Khan and Kirk is lost because they don’t have that shared history they did in the original version. In this Kirk is more of a minor inconvenience to Khan than his sworn enemy, and that really takes away from the film.

Also I’d like to know how someone who was around before the timeline diverged went from hispanic to the most English guy to ever exist. I know Benedict Cumberbatch was, and still is, a huge name, but if prime timeline Klingon ships are shown in the Kobyashi Maru test in Trek 09 surely Khan can keep his race/ethnicity in this?

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the Kelvin films, nothing new but I have Reddit now some at least I can write them down. I know they’re not everyone’s cup of Earl Grey tea, but for the 2/3 majority I for one really enjoy them, especially Beyond. But yeah...Into Darkness...really not the best",Just some thoughts on the Kelvin movies
startrek,"Star Trek TNG S1E4 Discussion 

Geordi was so excited about hitting warp 9. What a letdown. Is that the fastest a ship can go? 

I feel like data could have figured that finger trip out. Seemed weird to me but they kept running with that gag. 

All right Worf is getting involved! I know he’s a Klingon and is a warrior but that’s about it. Loved to see him stand up for Riker. Hopefully he can have some bigger roles in upcoming episodes. 

The Enterprise crew has been coming across as so weak. Bowing to the orders or two different leaders in a row. Then Riker, Geordi, and Data all get smoked once they land on the planet. They sort of addressed it at the end when discussing with the empire leader about their philosophy. 

The Ferengi were 200 years behind us in culture but their weapons are stronger than ours? Also more sexist aliens when it comes to Yar. Again already?

startrek,"So after binging through TNG, VOY and DS9 for the very first time and I just finished ""What You Leave Behind"". I know stuff like this get's posted **a lot** and no one really cares about my opinion, but I wanted to share my thoughts anyway.

Firstly I think I have to say I'm not a big Star Trek nerd. I watched the old (Kirk) movies as a kid and really liked them but that's about it. I've seen the 2009 film and thought it was okay, same with Into Darkness (haven't seen Beyond yet), but I didn't really had any interest in watching the ST series, until I started watching Discovery when the second season came out in germany (and I'm sorry but I love it). When the first trailer for Picard came out I finally deccided to give TNG on Netflix a try but it took me about half a year or so to get through the first two seasons before I started binging the rest of TNG (including movies), VOY and then DS9.
I think every series had many highs and sadly also many lows (weird sex with a ghost comes to mind) and a lot of stuff that was kinda cool but nothing special either, but in the end I really liked all three of them. I want to make clear, this is not a *hate* post and I truly enjoyed watching DS9 for the most part (in some episodes it's better then anything TNG and VOY ever put out).

But let's get to the point... I know this is a very unpoular opinion but I did not enjoy ""What You Leave Behind"" almost at all. I heard a lot about this being the best final episode of all the series, but I must admit I don't feel the same.

Firstly I hated how the dominion war just ended like that with part one and the second part just focused on the prophet and the Pah-wraith stuff... And with that I also have to admit I was not a fan of this stuff from the very beginning and I didn't really enjoy most of the episodes centering around this religious stuff (like when the prophets just made the Dominion reinforcments disappear like the biggest dues ex machina). I sometime felt like watching Supernatural in space with the prophets beeing the angels and the pah-wraiths beeing the demons (even till the point of them possessing people and the red eys). And what about Sisko? Is he dead? Is he a prophet now who lives in the wormhole? I thought that was not just a little bit weird. Imo this all felt very fantasy and not very sci-fi at all (even tho I **LOVE** fantasy even more then sci-fi). I don't mind a little weirdnes in sci-fi and Star Trek always had this (Q is the fucking best) but I never thought that that kinda stuff should be one of the main themes of a series.

And then you have the epilog with these super cheesy flashbacks... This maybe worked better back when it aired, especially if you didn't just watched all seven seasons in about a month, but I kinda just rolled my eyes at this. The simple moment, when Picard joined the rest of the crew at poker, had me in tears, but this just didn't really click with me at all. (I know the reasoning behind it and can't put blame on anyone, but with Jadzia beeing left out of the memorys this all just felt kinda wrong, especially with Worfs flashbacks) 

Don't get me wrong, I would prefer the flashbacks over the strange sudden ending of Voyager any time, but I don't really get the praise this finally gets.

Now please tell me why I'm wrong, while I start watching Picard. I'm one of those people who absolutly loved Star Wars the Last Jedi and I also love DIS, think section 31 is nice concept and don't really like some of the utopian stuff about the Federation, so maybe I just have strange taste.

tl;dr: I did not like the DS9 finale",Finally finished DS9 [SPOILERS]

This might be a weird thing to take away from Trek, and an even weirder thing to talk about here, but with my recent watch through of all of the Trek series on netflix I've found a sense of acceptance in my identity.  
 I've identified as an Asexual (and ~~probably~~ Bi-romantic) for a bit, but watching Trek has just made me feel more comfortable with that part of myself myself.  
   
All of the characters are valuable to Starfleet without considering their sexuality, Data for instance is as close to a confirmed Ace as we get, and my personal favorite because of his relate-ability to me... even though I have to ignore the whole ""fully functioning"" thing in The Naked Now.    
Then there's Spock, who debatably also expresses some asexual leanings.   
lastly Jadzia being an example of a Pan-sexual, (Confirmed by Terry Farrell herself!) female presenting, gender fluid person makes me unbelievably happy! There are moments that it comes through, but I honestly see them as funny rather than anything which pulls me out of the show like they would in others. I think of the Ferengi Oo-Mox ritual as a good example, that's just hilarious to me whenever it happens because it kinda mirrors how alienated I feel from sex stuff.   
Enterprise is a little less enjoyable for me because of the overt sexuality, but I still find joy within the platonic relationships in the show (especially Malcolm and Trip,) and I can't forget Porthos because doggo!",I'm finding comfort in my (a)sexuality through Star Trek

Many people don't like the Bajoran politic episodes, and this isn't one of DS9's best but I have a soft spot for episodes like this.  Louise Fletcher as Kai Winn is so wonderful and as I was watching I was thinking about how much she brought to the show.

One loose end I was wondering about was Kubus. The episode didn't resolve whether he was able to go to Bajor after all. Winn no longer had use for him after becoming Kai so maybe she withdrew her offer of sanctuary. On the other hand, Kira learning about what Opaka did - what she felt she *had* to do - could have given her a different view on collaborators like Kubus similar to how she changed her feelings in Duet.

startrek,"After seeing “The Inner Light” I’ve found that many consider it one of the best episodes ever. Fortunately for me, I had no idea about that and got to enjoy the episode with no inkling what I had in store. Picard having to experience an entire, full life, and realize everyone he grew to know and love in that life had been gone for many years, and he is now the only remnants of an entire civilization really had an impact on me.

A few episodes later, I watched “Relics” right before going to bed. Again, no idea what I was about to see. When Scotty showed up, I thought it would be a nice episode for nostalgia as I absolutely love TOS, watched it repeatedly as a kid, and only recently even gave TNG a chance (I’m so glad I did).  But showing Scotty grasp with the ideas that he was no longer the expert of the Enterprise, that all he knew and cared about were gone, and at the end of the day was no longer useful and quite honestly in the way struck a different nerve with me. Without too many details I am reaching the end of my own military career, and while not nearly as outcast as Mr. Scott, technology is definitely making me feel like a dinosaur.

Those episodes were a lot to take in on one day (among the others in between those). I’m so grateful I didn’t know what was coming and still don’t for the rest of the series.

Or.....

However, a lot of the old games have fallen into obscurity. Conquest was interesting but it has some major lacking and came out around the end of the lifespan of the PS2 and the Wii. Legacy, while I think it’s good, could have been better and was disappointing for the 30th anniversary(in my opinion). You had Birth of the Federation, but it only had the Next Gen era, but otherwise was good, just kinda overshadowed by other games. We recently had Bridge crew, but that fell into obscurity, and I haven’t heard anything about it in a while. Stage 9 was shut down by cbs. And then we have STO. I would say, it’s a decent game. However, I don’t feel like it is the game should be the pinnacle of Star Trek games. It is a MMO rpg, mostly focused on action and any character choices are mute. Most of the game’s content is locked behind Zen, which is just a paywall. While you can access the story and have fun, it doesn’t feel rewarding after you get to level 40, and if you don’t want to pay money, you can grind for days to get dilithium that will then convert into a negligible amount of Zen.

Voyager certainly did in it's pilot but not nearly as well.  TNG did it with Q but again, not as intelligently.  Q was a great character but he was a foil for Picard played mostly for comedy relief.

'The Cage' gets best episode because it's intelligence was so far ahead of it's time.  It's aliens didn't mask themselves as human, but manipulated humans with their artifice.

Why didn't they set up holo emitters to create holographic soldiers to defend the area.  The dominion is smart enough to use holograms.  When the jem'hadar showed up why did they not set their phasers to wide beam.  Why didn't they use drones and artificial satellites in orbit to observe the jem'hadar.  Instead of sending people on a suicide mission.  So AR-558 is just another example of starfleet getting people killed because of incompetence.

Overall, I thought this was a pretty weak episode. Lutan was so obviously a bad guy and the Star Fleet crew just came across as weak the whole time. My commentary below. 

So their first mistake was letting Yar go to the matrix room alone. Like yeah they all agreed she could go but I don’t remember them saying it had to be only her. And oh look, she got taken. Surprise. 

Weird that Wesley got a spot on the deck. Riker called it temporary, but we’ll see. Wanted him to earn it longer.

Oh and the fight is professional tag to the death. Gotta be some inspiration there. Lol

startrek,"Bit of a rant here (who am I kidding - it's a lot of a rant), but I just finished the show and, while it was entertaining, I would even call it good - I have to say - it just doesn't feel like Star Trek. At all. And I don't mean the constant action and brawls every episode - though of course, those contribute - but it's like Picard just forgot what Star Trek was about.

From the get go, we have a Federation that just... sucks. The Federation has been victim to sabotage by the Romulans, sure - but nonetheless, it's a broken, racist Federation, nothing like the one we know. Picard is a bitter old man living a quiet life in a shell of the Federation he once knew.

And sure, we had Deep Space 9, often considered the best Trek, making the Federation 'dark', and exposing corruption within the system, but no matter how dark DS9 got, it had a shining, very moralized crew to show the audience that there was still hope for good, no matter how broken the system was. Picard... doesn't have that. Picard has a bunch of bitter, broken people struggling within a demoralized Federation.

And besides that, Star Trek was always a very transhumanist show - from that episode back in TOS about transcended beings, to Wesley's ascension in TNG (yes, I know, we all hated it), Star Trek was always about going boldly forward - even Q was afraid of what humanity might become in the future, and that's saying something.

So the ending of Picard especially just felt... disappointing. Why does Data need to die to truly experience life? Why is Picard going to squander the opportunity of a \*new body\* on living out as a dying old man? Instead of the transhumanism that Star Trek has \*always\* purveyed, we've been given a fairy tale moral about how life wouldn't be valuable with death. It feels hollow and nonsensical. If you want to die, then die - but there's really no reason to live out your last few days in an increasingly decrepit body for that sake.

On top of that, the synthetic life versus organic life motif seemed a little bit... uninspired. First of all, is anyone getting Mass Effect vibes? And second of all, in an, again, transhumanist show, the implication that synthetic life is completely different and superior to organic life, and that there's no way for the two to work together (or, god forbid, exist as one) seems to lack vision to me. We've seen the 'AI will evolve and destroy all life' plot a hundred times before and it's not quite as compelling in a show about going forward - Picard himself says that fear is no way to live.",[Picard Spoilers] Does anyone else feel like Picard just... forgot to be Star Trek?
startrek,I've been binge watching enterprise.  They really were unprepared for the dangers of deep space.  They launched without all of their defenses.  They don't have a tractor beam or shields.  If it doesn't have shields they could at least use ablative armor but they didn't even do that.  And I'm not sure about the reliability of their transporter.  Especially since it caused hallucinations in one episode.  This is not the kind of ship a sane person would want to take into deep space.  Let alone go looking for hostile aliens.  This is the starship equivalent of those old world war two fighters that were made out of wood.  You would almost have to have a death wish to want to serve on this ship.  So they obviously had no idea what was out there.  If it wasn't for plot armor this ship would probably have been in tiny pieces long before the end of the first season.  Oh and it's really slow.  Twenty fourth century ships are almost twenty times faster.  So it would have taken them months to travel more then a few dozen light years.  Which means that outrunning hostile aliens wouldn't be an option.  Especially since many of them had ships capable of warp seven.  So the NX class is a death trap.  Anyone serving on one might want to put their affairs in order before hand.  It's probably the most rickety ship in star trek.  So let me know what you think.,Enterprise was unprepared for deep space

startrek,"I don’t know how many people have paid attention or who are common on the subreddit so who would know I make semi constant posts every so often the last few months and that I’m pretty brand new to the universe. I don’t want to keep pointing that out but I know it’s necessary to give context for what I’m feeling and trying to say or get others feelings on. I’ve only completed TNG and maybe midway through season 2 of DS9 in the main timeline series.

Now with that context out of the way I’ve watched both Picard and Discovery on CBS and honestly I haven’t had much problems with them. Starfleet is sad and depressed in Picard but that made more or less sense in the context of the show and I didn’t mind. The characters in it are also still really well done. So I’m more positive on Picard as additional context. Then I just finished up Discovery and I honestly don’t see any problems with it. It’s going back to true space exploration and space stuff that I’m not getting in DS9 and Picard took awhile to get to and even then wasn’t interesting, in space. 

One of my former coworkers is a Trek fan and hates Discovery because of the politics of the show and that it’s not true Star Trek. With previous context I can’t say one way or another if it is or isn’t but I never got the feeling it was dishonest. I haven’t yet seen a Starfleet during real wartime so the section 31 stuff made sense, even though I do agree that maybe they went too far or shouldn’t have had as much power after the war. And the season 2 baddie being an AI that all of Starfleet uses for strategic analyses is literally the worst idea ever. 

The Discovery itself is such a badass looking ship with a really intriguing special thing about it, the spore drive. It looks so sleek and dare I say sexy AF. Enterprise D ain’t got nothing on it. E is close though. Sorry TOS Enterprise but a little to simple for me lol. The spore drive in and of itself is something so brand new and amazing that I can see why Starfleet would want to look into it. Being able to just drop in and out of anywhere whenever is such a huge strategic advantage it makes sense. And that scene where it’s just jumping all over the damn place around a Klingon ship, I think the ship of the dead(?), was so outstanding and something I had wanted to see I loved it so much. 

Just saw the season 3 trailer and honestly it didn’t grab me at all. But I just want to know what the general opinion is of Discovery, not Picard that was just for added context, and why it seems to be mostly negative. I will say I’m more excited to get back into TOS, barely in season 1 so hardly worth mentioning, because the sound and ship designs, while obviously futuristic, still sounded the same and from the times we saw the Enterprise could see the similarities between this generation and back in the 60s. 

Total side note not at all connected to the main points of this but my god is DS9 honestly really boring and slow. Again only season 2 so I know it gets better later but god is it taking forever I just want to skip ahead but I can’t because that’s not appropriate and I’m a completionist.",Just general feelings on Discovery from anyone else
startrek,"This is something that always bugs me. Isn't there any culture on the Star Trek universe that is against beaming technology? I know that I wouldn't want to be beamed up anywhere, because the way I see it, teleport is just a fancy way of saying that someone was killed and a copy of them was made in another place.

I'm fine with many cultures accepting being beamed all the time, but even IRL I don't think there's any technology that everyone agrees it is ok. Some people are against blood transfusion, some people were against having their picture taken. And I imagine the First Directive would forbid the Starfleet beaming someone who opposed it on a cultural level.

So, did this subject ever came up on any Star Trek episode? I still haven't watched everything, so I wouldn't know.",Are there any culture against beaming technology?
startrek,"When I first watched the original series, I did so because I wanted view the franchise from the very beginning and while I enjoyed it immensely (It still has my all time favourite episode), I was always waiting to get to TNG.

It being the sixties I could understand why the characters never seemed to be that emotional and their attachment to each other always seemed so formal. (Except for Bones and Spock, of course).
I figured it was because back then, “men didn’t show emotion” and while there is definitely hints of that, I found myself disappointed that TNG seemed to be even more militaristic then in TOS. Everything seemed so formal and even the friendships took a back seat to politics and formalities. 

Now I’m not saying I hated TNG, in fact I’m going to do a rewatch after TOS, but I was disappointed in the direction they took StarFleet and the Federation as a whole. In TOS StarFleet was obviously based on the military, but they allowed for rule breaking and were more concerned about the “spirit of good”, rather then the fine print. 
 
Anyway back to my original point, as I’m rewatching the Original Series I’m becoming more and more aware of the personalities of all the characters, and though it focuses on the big three, as opposed to the more ensemble crew, the characters all seem so personable and deep. I could literally write an entire post about each of them.
 Kirk the StarFleet man through and through, who has to juggle his responsibilities and his ethics to save the crew, and occasionally save the universe.
 Spock constantly struggling to reconcile is two halves and it’s only until he dies, (and gets into the mind of McCoy) he manages to become more balanced. 
 Speaking of McCoy, what a fantastic character! Choosing ethics over orders and shows his true colours as the confidante and guide to Kirk.

As I’m going through I’m seeing a new side to each character and though there are elements that are dated, and certainly wouldn’t fly today, the show makes an incredible character study of three completely different people, who work so well together. Spock the brain, McCoy the heart and Kirk the body. Each different yet working together.

I hope that I get to see more depth when I rewatch TNG. Is there any character traits that aren’t obvious, that I should look out for?",Surprised By The Depth of TOS
startrek,"Did it have anything to do with visits from Lwaxana Troi?

Maybe not so much directed at her, but mostly for all the sh*t that follows her around, everywhere she goes. Every other time, Riker, Picard, Sisko and Odo, all had shields and defensive capabilities every time she showed up, and every time she did, something always happens.

startrek,"Most of the time at least in the TNG-VOY era the crew seemed somewhat informal with each other following only basic formalities as the situation called for it. Gene Roddenberry didn't even like to think of Starfleet as a military. 

They were especially informal much of the time on DS9. Yet when Cadet Nog started his training they were super formal with him. Everything was ""yes sir"" ""no sir"" snap to attention, be a rigid soldier. 

That sort of thing makes sense for a modern military where the priority is training men and women to be capable of going into dangerous situations and killing on command. You want to break them down into a rigidly obedient individual. 

But Starfleet's mission is primarily a peaceful one, they're interested in exploration, scientific discovery, charting new planets, that suggests something different than a soldier's mindset. I wouldn't think a soldier would make a terribly good scientist.

Now I'm not saying they shouldn't have combat training. Obviously its part of their function to be able to fight. But it doesn't make sense to give them the full traditional military conditioning. That's just my opinion.",I don't quite understand the militaristic attitude sometimes. Inconsistencies.

**ALL the main characters, from original series to Discovery, should make an appearance!** Yes, the main characters from Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, etc. I feel like a criticism of the reboot is that it feels too much like a action flick series for teens. And I see that, the second film had so many teenage novel fanservice tropes. Like the whole blood transfusion gimmick. If you're going to make a fanservice-y series, make it totally fanservice-y and cheesy! This would not only appeal to new viewers, it'd give a way for the ""purist"" fans to distance the reboot from the actual timeline.

DISCLAIMER: I've only seen Next Generation and the original movies in full.

startrek,"I saw a few Redditors who wanted to prepare before watching Star Trek Picard so I made a (short) list. 

If you want to watch Picard you need background information for the story. This is a very short list but I think it covers most of the series. Its important that you watch these episodes and the movie. If you dont watch them you wont understand everything. (Especially if you are new to Star Trek) 

The Next Generation:

- Measure of a man (About Data and Bruce Maddox) 
- Unification 1 &amp; 2 (About Romulus, not very important but it gives some context) 
- Face of the enemy (About the Tal'Shiar) 
- I, borg (About Hugh) 
- Best of Both Worlds 1 &amp; 2 (About Picards history with the Borg) 
- The Offspring (About Data) 

Movies:

- Star Trek Nemesis (Very important for the story around Data) 

Voyager episodes:

- Scorpion 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg and Seven of Nine) 
- The Raven (About Seven of Nine) 
- Dark Frontier 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg) 
- Imperfection (Icheb) 

This is a very short list. There are probably more episodes which would help. But I think the episodes above are the most important to understand events prior to the Picard series.

I'm watching TNG for the first time on Amazon Prime and regularly pause the episodes to Google search random facts and tidbits of information discussed on the show.

He stated that it was a mathematical equation that had been unsolved for nearly 800 years, and one that he regularly tinkered with because he found it to be ""stimulating"".

Cue the Google searching. I quickly found the link to the Wikipedia article on the equation, and was astonished that the equation had actually been proven in 1995, roughly 6 years after the aformentioned episode originally aired in 1989.

startrek,"I'm about two thirds of the way through my rewatch of Deep Space Nine, and it strikes me how perfectly analogous the show is for today's culture of lockdowns and social distancing. Something that has struck me over the last month is, despite how rapidly our way of living has changed, we have all adjusted and adapted just as quickly to existing in the shadow of this new threat. 

Compare this to Deep Space Nine. Yes, the the threat of the Dominion perpetually hovers on the other side of the wormhole, but Quark still must carry on doing business, dealing with the usual Ferengi politics. Life on the station changes drastically, from Bajoran political upheaval, to hosting a permanent Klingon garrison, but Dax still continues the customs of her people by assessing a potential Trill host. While it can definitely be argued that this quality of the show is partly due to its episodic nature, the writers are not afraid to maintain the consequences of the changes and the upheaval of the status quo. Things don't just 'go back to normal'. Our characters must adapt and, importantly, continue with their daily lives, facing the Marquis or Jem'Hadar when they must, and coping with the fallout. 

On my daily walks it now feels perfectly natural to encounter face masks in, what always felt like, my safe corner of Britain. So do the empty shops and restaurants I pass. So does walking into the road to give others a two metre berth. And, like the characters of DS9 who experience a massive change over the course of 7 seasons, I can return back home and continue with my work and other aspects of my life without experiencing too much dissonance.

I was off this week from work because of COVID-19 stuff, so I thought I should watch it.  I was honesty nervous and not excited to watch it.  I hadn't read too many posts about it because I was afraid of spoilers, but I had read enough negative things to make me not sure I wanted to watch it.

I bit the bullet and watched it last week.  It was honestly a little sad, Patrick Stuart is getting old ad it was almost hard to watch because of that.  I am a HUGE Star Trek fan Jean-Luc has always been my favorite captain.  It's hard to watch actors you love get older, it really is.  It was also the least ""Star Trek"", Star Trek series I've ever seen.  It had the same species, same Federation, same bad guys, and some of the same people but it was very different.  

The plot was confusing and jumped around, the dialog was stiff and hard to understand at times.  I didn't find the plot engaging enough to fully pay attention too, I found myself easily distracted and didn't care enough about the show to rewind.  

What I did like was the reunion of the familiar characters.  It was fun to see Picard catch up with old crew members.  It was nice to see the familiar species Borg, Romulans, and androids.  

The season was only 10 episodes long and it all came together rather conveniently.  I am disappointed because they could have done so much more!  They had the time, money, and resources to make a really wonderful show and the kind of blew it.  They were never going to do justice to TNG but they could have done more than what they did.  

If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's still Star Trek and it's still Jean-Luc.  If there is a season 2 I hope they do a better job.  I may go back and watch season 1 again in a few months, maybe now that I know the plot and where it's going I'll like it better.",Picard---Spoiler Free

Anyway, there I discussed how there was another race that to me, always seemed to be an analogy of autism, and I thought I’d make a full post about it here.
 To start I should say that I am on the spectrum myself so that this discussion will be more from that perspective than that of, say a psychologist. 

Anyway, it seems to me that the Liberated Borg are the most autistic people in the universe. I realise that they are not a species, rather a group of races freed from a terrible hive-mind but that rather helps my case I believe.

So to start, unlike the Vulcans whose society is dedicated to the concept of hiding ones emotions, the Liberated Borg are from many different cultures that view things completely differently. Similar to how someone on the spectrum can be born anywhere and to any culture. They don’t fit in with what their culture asks of them. 

•They have emotions but don’t know how to deal with them. 
•They struggle with many of the concepts of socialisation and have to be taught how to interact with people. 
 •They seem like outsiders to everyone else because they don’t know how to fit in.
•They don’t always know the right way to go about getting something they want and can come across as rude without meaning to.
•They find it difficult to make friends, not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t know how to, as such they tend to come together in solidarity.
•They like to be punctual and efficient and dislike when things go wrong, (like being late)
•They can become obsessed by things that make them forget about other aspects of their lives.
•They like things done their way, without considering how others might feel. 
•They struggle with sensory overload, but it’s inverted. Instead of being too loud (just an example) its being too quiet.
•They can have incredible knowledge in one field they find interesting, while not knowing a thing about something seemingly obvious.
•Most importantly of all though. They are all unique and these features don’t define them. They struggle but they learn. What might seem like a disadvantage, can lead to advantages elsewhere. They all have their talents, and eventually form very close bonds built with understanding and loyalty. 

Obviously these traits are down to the story and their past traumas, but like most species in Trek, they represent an aspect of humanity. I believe it to be autism.",Autism in Star Trek

I’m just wondering if anyone can tell me about a model that was released. I’ve looked online and can’t find any information.

When I was a kid, I used to go to a sci-fi/comic shop, where they had a very large model of the Enterprise-D, this was when the show was still on the air, or maybe it had just finished a year or two prior.

I’d estimate it was 4ft, maybe 6ft but probably not. It certaintly took up an entire display window. What I mean is, it may have been moulded from the original filming models.

I saw the same model years later (around 2015) in a forbidden planet in Bristol, so it wasn’t custom made. However the staff had no idea about the history.

startrek,"It seems to me that in every thread about Picard, comments originate from one of two camps: people who really appreciate the ride the show is taking us on, and people who have trouble enjoying the show because of its inconsistencies with both itself and with Star Trek past. And much like America's two political parties at the moment, debates between the two seem to be filled with resentment of one another. My solution to bridging this gap within this subreddit? Everyone should listen/watch BOTH the Greatest Discovery podcast and the re:Views posted on YouTube by RedLetterMedia.


If you're of the type wondering whether other fans must be watching with their brains turned off because of the show's seeming ignorance of canon or history (or sometimes logic), I think what you'd gain from listening to Adam and Ben is an understanding of how two people who have just as much fondness for Star Trek could enjoy Picard. I think you'd see that Adam and Ben are bright guys who are as big a Star Trek nerds as anyone else, they clearly do not watch with their brains turned off, and just engage with the show differently. Plus they're really funny.


If you're of the type wondering why other fans seem so nitpicky and frustrated with the show, I think what'd you gain from watching Mike and Rich is seeing how: 1) the issues they have with the show are very reasonable and often undeniable and 2) their criticism is borne out of a desire for high quality and a concern for how much care is given to a franchise they have deep affection for. They're far from sticks in the mud who sit around pining for old Trek and who hate anything new.


The two shows obviously aren't in dialogue and they won't reconcile the issues or viewpoints that the other one brings up, but I think digesting both of them helps produce a balanced view of the show and of modern Trek. Listening/watching them humanizes different perspectives and I think will lead to richer, more nuanced discussions among fans. I think you'll find them both worthwhile if you haven't already checked them out.",Greatest Discovery vs. Red Letter Media on ST: Picard
startrek,"I just finished Unification in my TNG watch through and at the end of Part 2 Data beems down to Romulus as his normal android self. He then talked to the common people supporting reunification, the senitor who is Spock's friend. In the same scene Several Romulan guards and Sela surround Data and Picard and Sela sais something along the lines of ""So this is the android I've grown to respect in combat"", addressing Data as an android in front of everybody. There is then few lines exchanged fairly calmly and they are taken prisoner. Durring that time only Spock and Picard are questioned and Data is unnecessary to the Romulans. 

Given what we now know about the Zhat Vash, and more importantly the general Romulan fear of synthetics, this seems rather strange. I get that a this point Data is one of 2 sentient androids and nobody knows how to make more, so he isn't an immanent threat. And might end up being useful as a Starfleet Officer so they don't kill him immediately. But it doesn't seem possible he could stand in front of Romulans from all walks of life as an android and nobody really seems to care. There isn't any unease or tension of any kind between the people in that scene. In the last episode of Picard Narak tells the Romulan myth of the original twins and he seems to expect the random Federation citizens he's talking to be at least a little familiar with it, which suggests every Romulan knows the story.

Obviously this is a ""The Zhat Vash and synth fear didn't exsist in the 80's so they writers didn't know"" situation. But does anybody have an in-universe explanation for why all the Romulans are chill with the destroyer of worlds secretly hanging out on Romulus?",Unification and the Zhat Vash
startrek,"Why do we want to make synthetic people out of organic material?  I let it go with the BSG reboot but now that more shows are trying to do it I must ask...how is this an advancement?  

Data was a great android.  He had human form and all the speed and agility and utility of a humanoid.  But he was stronger than an organic and much more durable.  Like if a disruptor rifle blew up in his face he would just fly to pieces and then could be put back together.

startrek,"We know in the Kelvin timeline, Starfleet is more advanced than the main universe's equivalent century. In fact, I read somewhere that in many aspects the Kelvin timeline was closer to 25th century technology in the main universe. We also saw how large and impressive a Constitution class ship was in this timeline. It is visibly larger than the Enterprise-D, possibly even E, and quite a bit more advanced than Kirk's main timeline ship. 

So if a 23rd century ship looked like that, how big would the Kevin equivalent of a Galaxy class ship be? I imagine a Kelvin Enterprise D would probably wipe the floor with a main timeline Borg cube.",Something I always wondered about the Kelvin universe.
startrek,"I came across a personal mini epiphany just now. While I liked the first season of Picard, the entire synth story should have been completely scrapped.

The main thread should have been the Borg Reclamation Project. There could have been diplomatic controversies surrounding it, allowing some old school Picard diplomat content.

There could have still been the Zhat Vash, but they could have been targeting the Project for the same reasons they had about the synthetics.

With those two concepts being the thrust of the show, that would allow so much more time to cover the relationships of the characters.

With the pacing of the show and the need to piss off to do the synth stuff, everything was rushed. I can go more into detail with this, but the more I think of the season, the more I cannot understand the creative decisions that were made for this show.",How Picard should have gone

But every major cruiser ship design that has come since (except one) has elongated and flattened the design in ways that feel either cumbersome or more aggressive, and I haven't much cared for them. I was only, like, 8 or 9 when TNG debuted, but I remember feeling disappointed with the design of the Enterprise D's Galaxy Class and thinking that it looked rather like a lumbering whale. I was excited when I saw that the Enterprise C's Ambassador Class had a much more Classic Trek design, but then bummed because I knew we were never going to see it again except in brief guest appearances. I was bummed again when I saw that the Enterprise B was an Excelsior Class ship (another design I feel unnecessarily elongated and flattened the classic design) and then lost interest in Starfleet ship design entirely when the Sovereign Class made its appearance. 

I don't understand the desire to keep flattening and elongating the classic design. I know that certain in-universe justifications have been provided, but I'm curious what the behind the scenes rationale and design philosophy behind this trend has been, and how other people in the fandom feel about it.",I am not a fan of the 'flattening' of Starfleet ships over time.
startrek,"I'm looking for an open discussion after watching Picard. I loved the series, don't get me wrong - but I was pretty disappointed for a season that revolved around Data and Hugh, there was no appearance of Geordi.

I've always been under the impression since TNG that Data and Geordi were best friends. Geordi always seemed to be the main go to guy for Data, encouraging him to explore dreams and emotions and Data even said to Lore that Geordi was his friend and that he would hurt Geordi for emotions when he was under Lore's influence. 

That's not to say that Picard didn't have a real profound influence on Data's development towards understanding humanity but they didn't seem to go and casually 'hang out' like Data and Geordi did on a normal friends basis - like Geordi and Data talk about their holodeck adventures.

startrek,"What shows or movies do you think feel like Star Trek but are not part of Star Trek at all? TBH I'm looking for good things to watch. 

I'll give the two that come to mind (feel free to take these as recommendations)

1. Interstellar: I know, I know, many people hate the ending, I love it but what ya gonna do. But conceptually this feels like Star Trek in a pre-Enterprise sort of way. You have an Earth that's dying from climate change as people are embracing anti-intellectualism and anti-science because they have simply lost hope in humanity's resilience. There's no immediate reason to hope so they just don't.   All changes when a group of human explorers goes into the unknown with a slim hope of saving humanity and expanding to the Stars. It's ultimately a story about how human ingenuity can accomplish anything. That's a very Star Trek message. 
2. Defiance: I recently rewatched this series, I was so pissed off when Syfy canceled it that I haven't given a Syfy show a chance ever since. This series is about a town where different alien species live in peace with each other, or they try at least. The backdrop of the series is a very vicious war between humanity and the aliens that left many cultural wounds between them. It ended when both sides in a battle defied orders, dropped their weapons,  work together to save the human and alien civilians that were caught in the crossfire.  It's very DS9 but set on Earth. The main character is the human sheriff, his alien adoptive daughter. (It also has beautiful cinematography for a Syfy TV show) 
3. BONUS: This is a completely different genre and medium, but if you haven't check out the Sherlock Holmes stories. 8/9 books are on the public domain so you can read them online, they're also short reads, like 100 pages each. There's a reason why there's such a crossover between Sherlock Holmes fans and Star Trek fans, they have similar themes and values but in completely different contexts.

Or should I watch the episodes in a certain order and alternate between the shows? Is there any crossover that I may miss if I don't watch them in a certain specific order.

Finally, what about the movies? Should I watch all the Original Series movies before even starting TNG or, again, watch them in between TNG episodes based on when they released?",Star Trek watching order?

If we could all just freeze everything, and keep providing services for free, we could bounce back faster.

startrek,"So, as the title indicates, I would like to discuss the drop of article ""the"" when naming starships.

What do you think guys? Has this issue ever been addressed before?","Drop of article ""the"" when naming starships"
startrek,"Spoilers ahead for Picard!

I just binged watched the season and wanted to write down some of my thoughts. I'm new to the Star Trek universe (except the JJ movies), and this was my first Star Trek show. 

And I will say I'm kinda in love with Star Trek now. The show was intriguing and exciting and was a fun ride. The whole universe was so cool (I really want a replicator please) and the overall story kept me on the edge of my seat. 

I really enjoyed all the characters, except for and I will probably get a lot of hate for this, Picard. He did have his moments for sure but I obviously have no prior knowledge or any nostalgic feelings for this guy, so I felt he was too much of a one dimensional, can only do good, character. He seems too black and white. Like he didn't have ANY misgivings about synth life that can literally destroy all organic life as we know it? Like he was a little too hyper optimistic. I know I definitely understood the viewpoint of the Tal Shiar given the vision/past they saw. 

But the moral greyness in a lot of the other characters, the sacrifice and motivations of some characters had to take especially in regards to taking a life to save another, is what really made this show great. Loved Narek (and his pain about loving Soji but needed to destroy her and her kind), Narissa (badass but anyone else get a little incest-y vibes from them early in the season tho?), Agnes (didn't care for her at first), 7 of 9 (also badass and gay. loved that she got revenge on that one chick on Free Cloud), Rios (love the multiple personality ship program thing, really cute) and pretty much the rest. 

However, I did think the ending was a little flat and unbelievable? I didn't have to suspend my disbelief THAT much prior to the finale. I know there was quite a bit of fan service in the show, and it kinda felt like the whole star fleet getting there in the nick of time by his old buddy was shoehorned in. Like this guy who hasn't been in Star Fleet for years just suddenly leads a giant fleet to stop an intergalactic event from happening? Not to mention they had banned synths and all of a sudden they're ok potentially starting a war with the Romulans just to save a handful of life they didn't deem worthy of existing in the first place? 

Plus the Romulans just backing out after they didn't activate the beacon was kinda too clean. The Tal Shiar's main objective their whole organization is dedicated to kill all synthetic life forms and they just back out? Would they not sacrifice themselves to see their main objective complete? And then synth ban is lifted and Picard comes back to life, which obviously they can't make a show with his name without him but it makes his sacrifice almost meaningless.

I think maybe if they hadn't rushed it so much and made the season a bit longer it might have felt more satisfying. However... saying all that, I do prefer a wrapped up season as opposed to cliff hangers. I'm glad the story was all concluded and I do love a happy feel good ending (that crew shot in the end tho!). Even tho the ending was pretty disappointing and a dip in the overall series I still loved the journey getting there and the season overall. And happy that this series exists, might make a trekkie outta me.

startrek,"In the opening of Hollow Pursuits, we see Dwight Schultz in ten forward acting like a loose canon in a starfleet uniform. Guinan says where he goes danger follows, and he pushes around Geordi and Riker. The illusion only really starts to break down when Troi is obviously into him after seeing him beat up her friends. 

Now to us, it might be more obvious that this is a guy living out a fantasy (either a dream or holodeck). 

But to audiences at the time, what was Dwight Schultz known for? He'd just finished his run on the A-Team as Howling Mad Murdock. So that makes him more credible as this tough guy that can bully the Enterprise crew. That makes it more believable that the writers might have actually cast him as this reckless violent officer. 

And then we have the reveal, Dwight Schultz is playing completely against type. Barclay is very different from his previous role, it really shows off his range.",Dwight Schultz in Hollow Pursuits was actually a nice bit of stunt casting.

startrek,"Thought/theory is for the Kelvin timeline and why the Enterprise seems huge compared to TOS and main timeline Constitution class ships. Could it be that since a future Romulan “mining” vessel attacked the Kelvin that Starfleet thought about it and were like “hmm. We need a bigger badder flagship than the one we have planned” and in so doing skipped the Constitution class and went straight into Constellation(?) or whichever is the next iteration or the one after that with size and power? 
Idk if it would be Galaxy class but probably by the time the Enterprise D comes to pass in the Kelvin timeline that would be further advanced as well. 
Pure speculation of course, and I think the real world explanation is it needed room for added shuttles and shuttle bays but I like thinking in world better. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of Picard. Now I’m pretty new to the universe of Trek, only finished TNG and in the second season of DS9, so I don’t have nearly the experience or knowledge to really say how it was as a Trek show and I get that. Having said that I’m kinda in the middle. 
On the one hand I loved Picard the character and his utter no nonsense on how Starfleet has disappointed him deeply. I’m on the fence about the world as it is since TNG explicitly stated, and I’m sure DS9 or Voyager also hinted at, that Earth is no longer about monetary gain or individual power and only wants to expand our knowledge and understanding of the universe or just do nothing. But they did I think a fair job in showing that maybe since the attack on Mars and Starfleet backing off that’s why things have gone back to our normal. 
On the other hand I also hate how characters we know and love aren’t around, for long at least, and the ones we do get are either boring or don’t get enough to do. Also starting to get annoyed with prophecies or warnings or in this case both at the same time. 
I do wish that for Picard they had made it more of the exploration of space with a subplot of the Romulan ploy or something like that and especially with the slow opening of the first few episodes that would have been better. 

Now for the season finale and Godamn idk how to feel about it. Gonna be honest I kinda wanted the Romulans and Starfleet to get into a massive battle as that could have been awesome but that’s not Star Trek and I get it. What Picard did was 100% the only way to go about it. 
His mind being transferred was absolutely predicted and foreshadowed and even though I knew they were going there I was hoping they wouldn’t and I would get pissed if they did it. So hoping they would just let him die after saving an entire race of androids and preventing a massive war. I know the show is called Picard but still they could have continued the show in his memory if they wanted. 
I still lost it when he died though. I don’t care if we all knew he was going to live so it shouldn’t matter or whatever but we still literally watched him die. The Picard we knew is dead. This Picard, while maintaining his DNA and memories, isn’t the Picard that died. He even had to make sure they didn’t make him immortal so that alone still confirms it isn’t our Picard. Having said that he’s also gonna be the Picard we still look up to and believe in.

startrek,"Out of all of the ST shows, Voyager is perhaps the one with the most potential, that was the least developed.

It goes beyond just photontorpedoes and shuttlecraft. After each episode, everything is back to normal and the crew goes back to being just regular Starfleet folks doing their thing.

There’s no sense of these people actually believing or acting like they’re going to be stuck in the Delta Quadrant for decades.


So how would you change the show and makes it live up to its premise?

Here are some of my ideas:

* Janeway starts turning the Voyager into a generational ship. They start growing their own food, plants start lining the corridors to take some of the pressure of the oxygen system.

* As the season begins, we see Starfleet members wearing their usual uniforms, while the Maquis crewmembers wear their clothes, just with combadges. As the season progresses, we see the two styles mix more. Starfleet uniforms appearing more out of regulation and Maquis members wearing parts of Starfleet uniforms.

* Janeway and the senior officers also come to the realization that in worst case scenario they need to start having children. Naturally encouraging people will only go so far, so what to do? Should the computer just pair people up? Artificial insemination? What about people who for some reason don’t want children?

* They decide to introduce holodeck and replicator ration priority to people who sign up for having children, which naturally leads to some grumbling. Will this ultimately lead to Voyager becoming a ship with a privileged class and an underclass? What about polygamous marriages? They’re against Starfleet regulations, but some crewmembers want to try that arrangement. Janeway decides to allow it and go against Starfleet regulations. One of many violations of official regulations to come.

* Janeway uses some Starfleet emergency regulation to declare existing marriages null and void. Janeway and the senior officers decide that they must lead by example, so she expects each of her senior officers to pair up with another. Much to her anguish she also chooses to set a good example, but with who? She knows Tuvac better, but marrying Chakotay might lessen the Maquis-Starfleet tensions that have been brewing.

* The Voyager gets an opportunity to take some years off their journey, but it means they must violate Starfleet directives. Janeway does this, and starts to realize that she might have to break more in the future to ensure the ships safety. Ultimately she decides not to commit an even more egregious violation of their principles. Which leads to...

* Janeways trial. The crew put Janeway on trial. For breaking Starfleet protocol? Or is it because she didn’t do enough to bring them home? The Voyager is in full mutiny, the senior officers are divided. Should they use force? Ultimately Janeway notices something encouraging. The fracture lines aren’t between Maquis and Starfleet crewmembers. Instead some of the Maquis join Starfleet crewmen in wanting to restore order, while some Starfleet crewmen have joined in with former Maquis and demand that they no longer strictly adhere to Starfleet protocol. As a result...

* The Voyager holds elections for the post of Captain and First officer. Janeway, much to her chagrin realizes that the ship that some day will return to the Alpha quadrant may not be a Starfleet vessel but something very different.

Aaaand, that would be my short treatment for the first season or two of Voyager.

What do you think? How would you make the show live up to its full potential?",How would you make Voyager more interesting?
startrek,"Let's be honest. We say TOS, but the title of the show is not ""Star Trek: the original series"", it is just ""Star Trek"" .

I'm a martial arts fan but I think there's too much of that genre crossing into the sci-fi of Trek, which is supposedly based on the possibilities of real science and astrophysics. Elaborate kung fu fighting is a fantasy. Burnham and Georgiou have been at it since the beginning of Discovery, and now in Picard we see Jason Bourne androids, a Romulan anime samurai, and Romulan spies doing spinning jump kicks.

The crew beam down to the planet and begin trying  to upload Picard's consciousness to the android-body. Picard's ""soul""  goes to the databank and speaks to Data's ghost and they say their  tearful farewells, Picard agrees to pull the plug and let Data die. 

 Meanwhile, in the real world, disaster - Dr Soong has selfishly  sabotaged the process, transmitting his own consciousness to the  android. ""Picard died a natural death,"" he argues, ""There's no reason he  should get what was meant to be mine!""

7 of 9 shows up and saves  the day; she injects Picard with Borg nanites that can regulate his  neural activity and keep him alive; the crew re-download his  consciousness back to his original body, and everybody is happy (though  obviously Dr Soong is now a pariah). Picard makes it clear he's happier  in his own skin, even if he has a small bit of borg tech back in the  mix, so everyone's relieved.

I refuse to pay for CBS All Access (I wish every consumer would do the same), but been binging Picard on free trial...

OMG! This show is soo fucking stupid. Such a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay for it. 

Let me start off by saying that I appreciate a lot with you Millenials. You are great with I.T., you have a wonderful sense of confidence, but your storytelling... is... just stupid. And that is what Picard seems to me to be, a Millenial version of Star Trek. You got the cliche badasses with vape pens, tattoos, the computer voice that sounds just like Siri, the impossibly badass fight scenes, the Lord of the Rings reject character, the convoluted storyline (because if it's complicated it makes it good right), the Game Of Thrones gore, that ""quirky"" sense of humor, the drinking whiskey out of the bottle, The F-bombs, and on and on. 

The ""badass"" captain guy who is smoking cigars in a spaceship listening to Billie Holiday on... VINYL; just so sickeningly hipster.  Come on. I know Billie Holiday is eternally cool, but can we lay off the cliche a little bit?

startrek,"Now that I've finished Picard, I am struggling to find a solid Sci-Fi show to watch. 

I've seen all the usual suspects (Babylon 5, Expanse, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, Farscape, SG-1, Dark Matter, Orville, Andromeda, X-Files, Dr. Who, etc...).  

Looking at Netflix or really any other streaming services, very few of the new shows are Sci-Fi.  And the ones that are (Lost in Space season 2) are kind of lackluster and predictable.   

So what gem have I missed?  Doesn't have to be in English as long as there are subtitles.","After Picard, what other Sci-Fi do you folks watch?"
startrek,"I've seen bits and pieces of Star Trek over the years, but I'd never been a huge Trekkie or anything like that. However, I eventually realized that a good deal of the sci-fi I've read/watched over the years is..kind of bleak and depressing. I love Blade Runner as much as the next person, but you can only read/watch so many cyberpunk/post apocalyptic stories about humanity failing to make any sort of progress in the future without getting kinda depressed. I realized I was craving some optimistic, humanistic sci fi where the future isn't a total shithole, so last December I decided to start watching Star Trek from the beginning. 

On the whole, I liked TOS a lot, especially the first two seasons. Despite the dated special effects and the surprising amount of casual sexism, a lot of it held up really well! My top ten episodes: 

1. **Balance of Terror** - A genuinely thrilling story. The fear and uncertainty surrounding the Romulans' sudden attacks on the Federation's outposts, the mutual respect between Kirk and the Romulan commander, it was all so well done. 

2. **The Enterprise Incident** - One of the few truly great episodes in season 3. I love the Cold War-style conflict between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire, and the budding forbidden romance between Spock and the Romulan commander makes me think of this episode as basically a Spock-centered Balance of Terror. 

3. **Journey to Babel** - The episode that really made me love Spock as a character. 

4. **The Doomsday Machine** - Like Balance of Terror, an episode that's aged very well. 

5. **The Immunity Syndrome** -The Enterprise vs. a giant space amoeba, some self-sacrifice from Spock, and Kirk refusing to allow it. What's not to love? 

6. **The Changeling** - Classic ""talking a computer to death"" stuff. 

7. **Obsession** - An underrated episode with some great character moments for Kirk and Bones. 

8. **The Trouble With Tribbles** - The scene where Kirk is chewing out his crewmen for getting into a bar fight with the Klingons never fails to crack me up. 

9. **The Devil in the Dark** - Another underrated episode. 

10 **The Ultimate Computer** - Fascinating episode about the dangers of AI. 

If you're wondering why I don't have **The City on the Edge of Forever** or **Mirror, Mirror** on my top ten list like everyone else does, it's because I think that those two, while good, are both a little overrated and don't deserve to be counted among the absolute best episodes. 

Now that the positive stuff has been said, I'll give some criticisms. Season 3 was a struggle to get through. The only episodes from this season that I really loved and can see myself rewatching we're The Enterprise Incident, The Tholian Web, and Day of the Dove. The rest of it ranges from mediocre to straight-up-awful (Spock's Brain, Turnabout Intruder). 

I'm also surprised at how underdeveloped Sulu and Uhura are as characters. After three seasons, I couldn't tell you a thing about their personalities, despite them being regulars. That said, I love Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty, and the post-episode banter between the three main characters was some of my favorite parts of the show. 

Anyway, this weekend I'm gonna watch the TOS films from The Motion Picture all the way to The Undiscovered Country, then I'm gonna start on The Next Generation!",Yesterday I finished watching The Original Series for the first time...
startrek,"Greetings everyone on this fine quarentined day. Over the past couple weeks I have recently found myself exposed to the new trek as well as the criticisms behind them and wanted to share my experiences as well as hear from others on theirs.

To point out though, I am only 18 years old. I have been watching Star Trek since I was two and have watched every series and movie. I do not know everything about Star Trek but I do know I am a major fan. I had initially avoided the New Treks, such as Discovery and the movies, since many negative opinions were floated around online. However, I have finally watched them and come to love them.

To start off, the movies. I had no quarrel with them at all. It was an attempt at starting over. Letting a new universe be built. I loved the fact that a seperate timeline was created just for that. I found it ingenious. However, I have never been the biggest fan of TOS. This new take on the movies gave me a new interest in Captain Kirk as a character and his growth in this new timeline. However, I was more intrigued by the relationship between him and Spock. The strongest bond between a captain and first officer ever seen in Star Trek. (I know many will say Picard and Riker were strong as well, but I saw that more as a Mentor/Ward relationship than a relationship between equals). Overall, I enjoyed the idea of the movies more than the movies themselves. I honestly was wondering if we would ever get a Kelvin Picard.

Next, Picard. Now, when I heard Picard was coming out, I started giggling like a child. My favorite species has always been the Borg. They were the species that caught the most of my attention throughout all of Star Trek. So, when I heard Picard was being made, I knew the Borg would return. In the past, over psychoanalysis of trauma indured by Star Trek characters seemed a bit... brushed by? I think this was because the world of Star Trek was originally assumed to be a sort of Utopia besides the happenings in space. I have heard several comments about how Gene Roddenberry would have never let certain things happen like they have been with New Trek. For instance, The Seven/Picard heart to heart of their trauma as Borg. Anyways, I digress. I watched Picard as each episode came out. I was seeing a lot of hate for it though. Some was understandable I would admit, but I noticed, the less I tried to compare it to continuity, the more I would enjoy it. Picard was the perfect love letter to the character of Data. I loved every second of it. The ending was slightly predictable though, however, thats how it is when you want to make more than one season. Picards characterization seemed a bit scattered at first but seemed to piece itself together near the end. I loved seeing the aftermath of the Romulan Supernova and seeing what the federation has become. Its flaws being unveiled. A common theme in New Trek. I always have enjoyed politics in movies and understanding motives. I guess that is why I liked the Star Wars Prequel triology. I will admit though, it does not take the cake as my favorite Star Trek series.

Finally, Discovery. Oh boy. The awful comments I have heard of this show over the years. I never stepped near it until recently and I must admit, I was surprised and impressed. After watching Picard, I knew Discovery's biggest problem will be keeping to continuity. I knew if I watched it while keeping that in mind, I would find myself miserable. So, I watched it without it in mind and frankly, I loved it. The character depth in the 15 episode first episode made me feel so connected to the characters faster than even my favorite Star Trek: DS9. I loved the politics behind it all. The lore expansion of Sarek and consequently Spock. I loved the fact that the Mirror Universe became a maine plot point. I loved how despite Starfleets imperfections, its morals and values was the main driving force. The action sequences were incredible. The idea of the spore drive, although a bit out of the wrong time frame, is freaking cool. At the time of this post, I am on Season 2 Episode 2. I must say, I have fell in love with Captain Pike so quickly. The wisdom he holds is prominent. The actor who portrays him is excellent. I am so excited for the second season plus whenever the third comes out

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please share your thoughts and opinions! I love having civil discussion.",An Opinion and Discussion on New Trek
startrek,"I just watched the Voyage Home because the Guardian did an article on it. 

I mean, the writing is a masterclass, no line is wasted, whether it’s an (earned) character moment, a set up to a later scene (or a payoff) or just a nice general piece of witty business.  

The performances, particularly the leads, are note perfect, underplayed, and warmly conveyed with just the right amount of tongue in cheek. Most of it actually plays more seriously than I actually remembered. There’s only one bit of *The Shat*, when he spots George and Gracie on the side of the bus. 

Other than that, it’s a perfect piece of storytelling, with the emphasis on story. 

All too often we see things that are either all plot and no character or all character and no plot. This was a fine example of ST doing both.  It deserves its place as the best performing (as I understand it, when adjusted) and is probably the best recognised (after Khan) with the general public, even if that’s just as “the one with the whales”.  

Bravo Mr Nimoy, bravo Mr Meyer for your script polish.",The Voyage Home is a Masterclass
startrek,"coming from someone who likes star trek. a lot. 'juvenile' is the best way to put it. this comes through most in the dialogue. clumsily written and inarticulate, like a child trying to express a very deep thought but lacking the language to express it. you read between the lines and say 'i'll give you a pass because i understand what you were *trying* to say.'

i have complicated feelings toward most of the social allegories in star trek. people who criticize these usually say something along the lines of 'old trek had subtlety, new trek beats you over the head with a moral stance'. ok, fine point to make, we could debate the trueness of that statement all day. personally i think old trek was just as hamfisted; we put up with it because everything else was campy in equal measure. but i think it misses the actual issue, that being that almost every allegory it attempts lacks depth. hate in real life is this complicated web of emotion and bias and circumstance. when trek does a direct allegory it usually goes something like 'x aliens don't like y aliens, because they're y'. childish. you know?

i think this is why my least favourite episodes are ones dealing with large-scale interplanetary conflicts. war is a tricky subject. star trek... tends to swing in the direction of unintentional propaganda. 

to clarify, this isn't about realism. it's a melodrama. i don't seek literal realism in a genre that sets out to be a dim echo of reality at best. i do want it to *feel* real. good fiction will convince you of the most unbelievable things. this particular aspect leaves me unconvinced.",does anyone feel the entire franchise is consistently written in a really juvenile way?
startrek,"I would have rewritten the series so that the synthetics end up summoning the Q.

Everyone is standing there stunned, Q turns to then an says

""Oh please you organics and your prophecies, I always told the Continuum that the warning was far too apocalyptic""

""What is going on down there?""

Q responds

""Jean Luc  you didn't really believe that we would destroy all organic life how banal and uncreative, we simply wanted to ensure synthetics had a chance to properly flourish and live up to their potential""

Q waves his hand and their ships disappear

""Well enough of that"" he turns to the Android's ""and you my distant distant cousins where can I take you on what planet would you like to make your home, if you're comfortable here I can simply rearrange some things""



Kinda a shit post and yes the entire show would need to be rewritten around this ending but God damn the entire time I'm watching and going where the hell is the Q? aren't they supposed to be pretty much involved in any galaxy-wide Extinction?

startrek,"Now I've been alive almost as long as trek has been on the air,  so yes I'm an old trekkie,  but I do have a question, While I like the visual styling,  I wonder we do have evidence from ds9/voyager that the uniforms are one way, but then they are another way in picard,   the 3d interface, we know it's a thing,  which is cool.  

But why has everything ship wise taken on a huge discovery feel and look?  the ships themselves also look like they went backwards to 23rd century designs.    was this because of the wars? and the lack of the ability for the federation to rebuild quickly?  I'm so confused on this, I remember tos era, tos movie era and then bam tng era and I had the same questions back then basically.",Visual changes why?
startrek,"So I recently watched Chain of Command and I won't gush too much but suffice to say the episode earns its status and reputation. Strangely despite initially disliking Gul Madred I actually ended up liking him in some sense. I know that sounds weird, but I wasn't expecting him to get the character development that he did, which coupled with the fine acting of David Warner gave a full picture of his character that I appreciated rather than some one dimensional monster. I also like how he actually seems to have a good deal of respect for Picard despite being his torturer and I think some of the best moments in the episode are when he accidentally let's his guard down around Picard. There's almost a strange Stockholm Syndrome dynamic in a way.


However my question lies at the end of the episode in the infamous 'four lights' scene. After being told he is too be released just after one last torturous move by Madred Picard defiantly shouts that there are four lights, despite believing there are three. As Picard is dragged away we see his torturer give a little smile. Initially I assumed he was smiling out of an admiration for Picard, knowing that the respect he had come to have for him was earned, but when the episode ended I reflected on the smile again wondering if Madred knew that he had cracked Picard and was pleased with himself, if he understood that in the end his captive truly believed there were five lights. I'm wondering if anyone else has given this much thought and if so what conclusions you've come to, would love to hear some discussion about this and anything else about the two part episode really. I'm not sure what the general consensus is but I feel like they also gave a good deal of character development to Captain Jellico and I'm glad he wasn't just a straight up asshole if you'll excuse the term. Despite not liking him overall (not disliking either) I actually felt like Riker was being unreasonable at times and maybe a little arrogant, while also seeing both men's side. Very good episode.",I have a character question about Gul Madred in TNG's 'Chain of Command'. Looking for some discussion.

I know about Spock's death, Kirk's death, ""Kahn!!!!!!!"", Picard's transformation into a Borg, the Voyager making it back to Earth, Data's death, and some other small things. I really want to watch the show because I have a desire to explore and see the unknown, but I'm afraid the series has been ruined for me since I know most of the major plot points.

startrek,"So there’s been a lot of debate about the different captains: Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Sisko.

But what about the second in command, their “Number Ones”?


I’ve taken the liberty of ranking them from worse to worst, and starting off the list we have... 

Riker: Picard’s faithful right hand, who was a little too happy with his lot. Instead of moving up in the ranks, like you’re supposed to, Riker was seemingly obsessed with his captain and stayed on year after year. He passed on multiple opportunities to become captain, despite the problems this created. (Namely: Holding back other officers who wanted to be promoted to Riker’s position.)


Kira: Who somehow managed to become Sisko’s second in command despite having a background as a... Terrorist. Kira constantly second guessed Sisko, and never missed a chance to become involved in some conflict of interest when it came to Bajor. Rather than being a neutral party, Kira would either make enemies of Bajorian political and religious leaders, or become involved with them romantically.


And the worst of the worst?


Chakotay: Who not only joins Kira in having “terrorist” on the resume, but also was so immersed in his ancestral, new age mumbo jumbo, that his spirit animal probably would have made a more competent Commander. 

We’re talking about a man so utterly irresponsible, that he (on at least one occasion) risked the ship and entire crew **because of a peyote fueled vision quest!**",Who was the worst number 1?
startrek,"the Set up of voyager was so unique and had such promise. 2 crews, 1 from a new starship with mostly Junior officers left,  the other a rag tag team of terrorists/ freedom fighters who hate the federation almost as much as the Cardassians. Both crews commanded by captains who couldn't be more different.  Janeyway was a veteran of star fleet but she didn't have a lot of real world command experience. Chakotay rejected an already brilliant career starfleet and embraced being a cold and calculating rebel leader. But with Voyager so far from any allies or supplies they had not choice but to work together to find a way home.  The 2 crews would have amazing conflicts and problems we'e never seen in star trek before. 

Well pretty much all of that was dropped during the first season.  The 2 crew conflicts were entirely dropped and rarely even mentioned again, Voyager's isolation and inability to properly resupplyor repair became more like a continuity error running gag.  Janeway was rewritten to be completely schizophrenic and Chakotay, who was set up and acted so well at the beginning of the show  just turned into stat trek's biggest nothing burger. Voyager isn't star trek's worst series, but it's complete waste of it's immense potential will always be it's only achievement for me.",The wasted potential of Voyager always pissed me off
startrek,"Not sure if this could ""technically"" be considered a spoiler, but better safe-than-sorry I guess.

I'm watching BBCAmerica, and they're airing the famed Bruce Maddox episode about Data's sentience. (""*The Measure of a Man*"") This is the first time I've watched the episode since I started watching Picard.

Now having watched the entire first season of Picard, I find myself watching this episode with new eyes. 

The episode seems to have more weight... seems to be more *special*. 

What do you think? Have you gone back and watched this episode yet? What are your thoughts now, as opposed to pre-Picard?",Does Picard change your view of TNG?
startrek,"1) Where did Maddox get the image for Dahj and Soji

It's established in the first episode that those twins were modled after Data's painting ""Daughter"". This is latter confirmed when they crewe find Maddox at Freecould. However it's also confirmed nobody except Picard had access to that painting. Given his reaction isn't ""Well someone probably space-googled it"", it feels safe to say that was a private painting. Maybe Maddox asked the Data simulation, but then why didn't Data ask someone to be terminated before? When Picard asks if he's immortal Alton states ""we were all listening"". This seems to be a reference to what Data said but it could easily be what Picard said when telling everybody what happened when he talked to Data again after being put into the Golem. We don't see any monitors or ways to look into the Data simulation so the latter seems more likely.

2) Where did Maddox get a neuron from Data's brain?

In the first episode Jurati doesn't believe Maddox could have created any androids becouse he would have needed ""a single neuron from Data's positronic net"" to completely re-create it. While it can be argued this is more symbolic, in the opening credits we see a single ""atom-thing"" split into to and start forming artificial DNA and an eye, which suggests the new android parts are ""grown"" (in pairs) from the one neuron. But it's never explained HOW he got that neuron when Data's body was completely destroyed. Did he venture to the several year old site of the battle from Nemesis and painstakingly look for a single neuron? Did he use B4, and if so why arn't the new androids less developed as that would be re-growing B4's positronic net, not Data's.

3) Why is Data a formless consciousnesses (in universe, it makes sense thematically and for the plot)

I'm perfectly fine accepting Maddox re-built Data's positronic net, then studied and improved upon it to make the superior new androids (contractions, complex emotions, etc). However, when we meet Data again, he's consciousness was restored and put into a ""highly complex quantum simulation"" without any real form. My question is why? If the process of re-creating Data's positronic net (seemingly a physical thing) is actually just restoring code then how did Maddox get any useful information to create the new androids? Not to mention where did he put Data's consciousness if he didn't have a positronic brain for it, as he had yet to study Data. If Maddox did completely restore Data's brain but not his body, why didn't he just build Data a new body when he was able to? Or for that matter build him a ""fully human"" one like Dahj and Soji? Or why not steel B4 when he left and just replace the brains? Or steel Lore for that matter (who was stored somewhere at Starfleet after TNG). They mentioned Data's memories caused B4's net to fail so it wouldn't me murder of any kind.

4) Brain and brain, what is brain?

On a final note Data's new brain doesn't appear to be his old one at all. When Picard pulls the plug, he literally pulls out 3 isolinear-like chips, each one ""ages"" his consciousness. However if the whole point of restoring Data was to study his brain, why is he now stored on 3 chips? You could argue these chips store the simulation while Data is hooked up inside the machine, but then what Picard did isn't death, it's just pulling his off switch which can be turned on at any point. If Data was moved from his brain so Maddox could story it by destroying it then what was he moved to if nobody could build a positronic net that sophisticated?

startrek,"Recently, the moderation staff was talking over the uncharted possibilities of April Fools gags we could feature on the subreddit today. Most of us agreed that, given the global situation, it may not be the right time for tomfoolery. In lieu of a prank or biting satire, we're instead interested in sharing with the community one of the things that Star Trek does best: hope. 

We discussed it and came up with a few episodes that always leave us feeling optimistic and uplifted, and we would love to hear from the community about what in Star Trek can always bring the light, even in dark times. 

##Star Trek: Discovery
* S02E02 ""New Eden"": Pike, Burnham, and Owosekun beam down to a planet of WWIII-era humans who have created an aggregate religion and have left behind science, and only Discovery can save them from an impending natural disaster. In the end, there is an everlasting ember of hope left with the people of the planet, even if they don't all know its true nature. 

##Star Trek: Enterprise
* S02E02 ""Carbon Creek"": In this episode, T'Pol tells an ostensibly apocryphal story about the real first landing of Vulcans on Earth, of her 'great-grandmother' experiencing humans in rural America in the 1950s. The episode is lighter in tone than many of the series, and explores acceptance, learning about new cultures, and discovering things to be cherished in the most unexpected places. 
* S02E24 ""First Flight"": Basically, this episode is what was originally conceived to be the first season, a Star Trek adaptation of  the early NASA missions a la *The Right Stuff*. It's pure Star Trek: optimistic and hard working people who solve a seemingly insurmountable obstacle because they're fueled by the motivation of exploration. 

##Star Trek: the Original Series
* S01E19 ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"": After the Enterprise is thrown back to the 1960s, the crew has to rescue a fighter pilot without damaging the timeline at such an important moment in human history. Somewhat like ""First Flight"", this episode is centered around the 1960s optimism-fuel that was the space race, and predicted eventual missions to Saturn. 
* S02E15 ""The Trouble with Tribbles"": Adorable, funny, sweet, with a kitschy whodunit, it's impossible to finish this episode without a big smile on your face. Particularly for those sheltering with beloved pets, this is a must-watch. 

##Star Trek: the Next Generation
* S05E25 ""The Inner Light"": largely considered one of the best episodes of any series, ""The Inner Light"" is a meditation on life, even the most humble life, and all of its complexity and pain and beauty. The episode is unmissable. 
* S06E15 ""Tapestry"": a personal favorite, Jean-Luc Picard is critically injured on an away mission, and Q shows up to play the role of Clarence in allowing Picard to see what his life would have been like had he made a decision differently. This is a perfect episode to help one process regret and the very ending is one of the most beautiful character moments for Picard. 

##Star Trek: Deep Space Nine 
* S03E22 ""Explorers"": a classic episode of exploration, honoring the explorers of the past, and overcoming adversity, with some beautiful father-son character moments along the way. And having Gul Dukan eat crow at the end is the icing on the cake. 
* S06E14 ""One Little Ship"": hey, remember that time the Rubicon was smaller than a hotwheel and they beat a bunch of Jem'Hadar? It's impossible not to have a great time with this episode. 

##Star Trek: Voyager
* S04E36 ""Hope and Fear"": This episode is about hope, then not hope, then hope again. In this hope sandwich, Voyager is made aware of the USS Dauntless, a Federation ship with an experimental propulsion system that could mean getting home. While all is not what it seems, both seeing the crew given hope by this possibility and the wonderful discovery in the end something wonderful does happen. 
* S06E09 ""Blink of an Eye"": This one's got it all: timefoolery, space-race-era alien astronaut, ancient astronauts, Daniel Dae Kim, and most of all seeing a planet go from pre-Industrial to post-Voyager, and seeing them take responsibility for saving themselves and saving Voyager. And that last shot.

This episode features a friendly and advanced alien race that clearly keeps its third gender as chattel slaves.

I am sure, back in the day, this was a magnitudinous event. Ten years of no Star Trek, and now a high budget movie. I get it. People were stoked. This, of course, was before my time. I wouldn't know. But I can guess.

Kirk meets Scotty. Oh the joy. Kirk sees The Enterprise... And FOR TEN MINUTES boards it. The epic music. Dragging. Dragging. Oh my God, it's dragging. Then Kirk meets ""Bones"" McCoy. I still don't know why he calls him that. Holy shit, another epic meetup. Then The Enterprise takes off into space in another dull sequence. Oh my God, it's so slow. Then Spock shows up. Great, he's awesome. But he sucks in this movie. WTF - I'm an HOUR into this shit and NOTHING has happened.

Seriously, guys, I'm pissed. I've invested like 9 or 10 hours of my life into this and all I want is Chewbacca.

startrek,"SPOILERS FOR PICARD/DISCOVERY(maybe)

**Don’t just downvote as nutrek hate, I don’t hate any of it,** I’m just looking for people’s perspective. 

I mean the whole plot of Picard doesn’t really count as world building in my mind. It’s just story telling. They aren’t writing any new LORE (not data’s brother, I mean worldbuilding) 

For instance, today I saw an episode of voyager, the one where belanna visits the barge of the dead. A whole hour dedicated to exposition on Klingon death beliefs and there was another voyager episode where fake kaless shows up, another whole hour dedicated to exposition on the deep inner workings of Klingon society. Not to mention worfs multiple sagas and that’s like I dunno at least 10 more hours revealing the inner workings of Klingon politics, expectations, roles in their society, etc. not to mention ds9 and what we learn about cardassians. Remember that whole episode dedicated to a cardassian lawyer and his daily life in court and we learn about cardassian justice system. We learn so much about these societies and it’s fascinating. 

Then discovery comes along, what do we learn? Klingons bad, unite for battle. That’s.... shallow. A traitor captain in the mix didn’t add anything of interest either... again just story telling. No world building. 

Same in Picard, all we really learn about the romulans is there happens to be a bunch who hate androids and try to kill em. Ok but.... what else? So simplistic and shallow. Nothing built... just a story in the framework of existing lore. 

The universe (of lore) is no longer being built and this deeply disappoints me. 

Anyone else feel similarly?","I feel like 90s/classic trek constantly did “world building”, but modern Trek “only tells stories” in what was previously established. They stopped fleshing out the universe. This is why I feel disappointed in new Trek."
startrek,"Seriously I have enjoyed Enterprise from season 2 onwards, I don't see how it could be so hated while so much stuff is agreed to be worse. While I hated Discovery I disliked a lot of TNG, DS9 and VOY episodes that seem equally terrible so I find it hard to see why a series that seems like a really good entry point to a new viewer or a place for old viewers to find so much hate would be able to take up so much conversation. Some of these episodes are well good and I feel like a lot of them deserve proper consideration

This is not an edit, but for the purpose of your criticism the only series I really genuinely dislike is Discovery. I do dislike individual episodes of the others quite a bit though. Criticise and advise as you see fit","Why is Enterprise so good, and why is it so often left as the worst trek in people's opinions"
startrek,"I have never seen Star Trek before, that was, until tonight when I came across 'Deep Space Nine' on NetFlix.  Just finished episode five where Tosk, whom of which I guess is considered to be an 'alien' that crashed into their region of the galaxy, needed their help woth repairing his ship.

I like the storyline and occasional humor.  The brown dude with huge ears plays a very cool character as well.

Before getting to much further into 'Deep Space Nine, are there episodes I should be watching first?",Just started watching Star Trek (Deep Space Nine) for the first time. I'm in love already.
startrek,"Or is it just because we are all cooped up in isolation because of this pandemic? I feel like the negativity towards the new Trek has been more apparent lately. In general, I can't agree with all the hostility being thrown at PIC or DISCO. My Parents are Trekkies and I grew up watching TNG and VOY. And even though PIC has some imperfections, I really enjoyed the story as a whole. Hell, I'm one of the few who loved DISCO season 2 and cannot wait for Season 3.

But come on people. Can we stop with all this hate towards the new Trek? Yeah I get that times are tough, but don't take it out on Kurtzman and Chabon. They are just as much Trekkies as the rest of us. They might not give you the perfect story, but neither would any of us.

I think the problem that New Trek faces, is it can't just be good, it has to live up and outdo the expectations of any Star Trek fan. An episode of PIC or DISCO isn’t compared to the actual quality of your average episode of TNG or TOS, it’s competing with the concept of ‘STAR TREK’ in the collective memories of Star trek fans.

So PIC, which is basically your average peak-tv era show with some fun ideas and details thrown in, gets seen by so many people through this extreme framing that makes it impossible, for a contingent of people to enjoy it for what it is. This is just my take on why the negativity is so bad. 

And I can't emphasize this enough. This is not an attack on the people who have very strong opinions about DISCO and PIC. I just want to help you guys see that perhaps, you are judging the newest Trek, much too hard. I think there was a lot of good that came form PIC season one. And I think the DISCO has a lot to offer too. I hope we can all try see the positives, among these trying times.",Does this community really have so much distaste for new Trek?

KIRA: That's right.

RIKER: Nice work. You know I'll have that thing bypassed in thirty minutes.

KIRA: At least that'll be thirty minutes that we're visible.

RIKER: Fortunately, I was able to take us into a nebula. No one's going to see us.

KIRA: Thanks.

RIKER: You're lucky you only got singed. You know the whole plasma relay could've exploded.

KIRA: Yeah, that was the idea.

RIKER: You've been fighting Cardassians most of your life. I know that you sympathise with what we're doing here.

KIRA: I fought the Cardassians because they invaded my home. You don't live in the Demilitarised zone, you don't have family there. Why are you in this fight?

RIKER: *Because people are dying in the Demilitarised zone and Starfleet isn't doing anything about it.*

KIRA: Taking the Defiant only raises the stakes. The Cardassians are going to send a fleet after you. They are going to kill more people hunting you down than 
they ever did during those border raids.

startrek,"I am a huge Spock fan and this episode is one of my favorite. However, watching it given the current context the beginning make me cringe. The Enterprise is supposed to deliver an important medicine to a planet with an epidemic. It could be there in 3 days instead of 5. Kirk choose to look after a space phenomenon. Of course, it wasn't suppose to go bad as it was, but even if all went well, it is at least 2-3 hours lost, during which many thing could go wrong, making them lose more time.

Even of the idea was probably from Spock in the beginning, Kirk shouldn't have accepted. It put many lives in danger for basically nothing. There wasn't even coffee in that quasar ;)",Watching TOS: The Galileo Seven
startrek,"I've noticed tensions seem high regarding the series. As someone who didn't like it very much, I thought I'd say some nice things about it.

\-I really liked Elnor. I thought I'd get some cheap shots at the series with a sword-wielding Romulan teenage ninja with a Badass Catchphrase (TM), but they balanced him by showing him as a vulnerable teen who is good at the one thing, but still very young. I liked him quite a bit by the end.

\-Romulan culture. It's weird--well, in character, I guess--that we know so little about the Romulans despite political tension between the Federation and the Romulan Empire lowkey running throughout all of TNG. The notion of rear doors and secret names and ancient demon queens and secret organizations are all aspects of a believable society that bucks the franchise's trend towards being a monoculture.

\-I love Elim Garak, but Narek is the franchise's best spy in my book. He's interested in intelligence, he works assets, he's clever, he solves problems, and he puts aside his personal feelings to do his job. He's an asshole and a Bad Person, but that's the nature of spying. He's miles above Obsidian Order thugs and the omni-competent-because-the-plot-says-so Section 31.

\-Narek's position was an interesting paradigm. He was the one competent person within his organization and also the only one not initiated via deep emotional trauma. It's an analogy for institutional mores and their ability to ostracize rather than learn from deviance. A sharp contrast to what the Federation should be.

\-I liked Seven of Nine. I eventually stopped watching Voyager because of Seven of Nine. I've only picked up a few episodes since and my impression is that as she expressed herself as a person whose personality is determined in no small part by her Borg upbringing that expression is squelched by her captain because it's not ""human enough."" Seeing Seven making her own decisions (for better or worse) and deciding to do something(s) noble seemed real, consequential, and very welcome to me.

\-The interlaced climaxes. Several episodes featured two climactic events happening at the same time with cuts between them. I've seen a few other shows do this (I think Castlevania Season 3 closes out that way), but I haven't seen Star Trek do it before. It was visually interesting and I enjoyed it.

\-Frakes was great. I didn't go in to this feeling as though I needed any particular callback to previous shows, so each one was a treat. Even more than that though, when Frakes said ""shields up!"" my brain thought for a moment that I had Netflix open to a TNG episode in another tab. Dude sent me back in time about 26 years. I enjoyed that they followed up on All Good Things by showing Picard, Riker, and Troi as friends.

\-Troi's is used better than she probably ever was on TNG. Her empathic powers are used to move our story forward and let us express Picard's feelings despite his recalcitrance. Her non-empathic abilities as a counselor are used well to try and help Soji and Picard work together. 

\-Kestra was a welcome character. They had a lot of presence. Also, I watched the episode twice and didn't notice where Kestra was referred to as a 'she' or 'daughter.' I'm positive they were, but until someone corrects me I'm believing they are--despite their affiliation with Thad's warrior women--Trek's first non-binary character.

\-Even putting that aside, Kestra hunts and kills a dangerous creature, which I think is a great touch for kids in Star Trek. They should be as familiar with the elements of their world--the where-does-my-food-come-from and how-does-my-car-go--as we might expect of adults today. Whether that's the woods of Nepenthe or the city of San Francisco, kids who are healthy, fed, and educated since birth should surprise a modern viewer with their knowledge, discipline, and maturity. Kestra demonstrates that and I'm a fan.

\-Those post-Nemesis, pre-Picard uniforms were really nice. I have strong opinions on Star Trek uniforms and they were top tier.

\-Raffi and Rios had a friendship that seemed to grow from a casual association over the series. The moment when she goes to his replicator to get coffee for him instead of booze for herself crystallizes those two being close and it feels like an earned payoff.",I'd like to say some nice things about Star Trek: Picard
startrek,"In this somewhat divisive time in the fandom, can’t we all agree to appreciate Leonard “Bones” McCoy?

He’s the heart of the Enterprise and a gentlemen to boot. He is the most compassionate character in the Original Series, and I would argue, the entire franchise as a whole.

The idea of making him a “simple country Doctor” is actually a genius one. He, through his role as an advisory character, manages to humanise the crew and the show, that at the time ran the risk of alienating the audience. 

When others mention the wonderfully in depth portrayal by Leonard Nimoy, and the charming performance by the Shatner himself, people tend to forget the man who brought such a dynamic character to life.
Deforest Kelley managed to play a grumpy old lovable and kind man we all know and should love.
He set the standard on how the Doctors are written in later shows, and managed to play a hilarious yet important man who always managed to do or say the right thing.

While later Doctors would probably beat him in term of amazing feats, McCoy was always the heart and soul of the Enterprise and became the confidante of one of the popular Captains of all time. 

His speech in Balance of Terror is one of the greatest in tv history. Seriously it’s so good. Go and watch it. It needs to be talked about more. It’s beautiful. 

For these reasons and more, he is my favourite character in the entire Trek universe.",Can We All Just Appreciate McCoy for a Second?
startrek,"35 year Trek fan here. Last year I undertook a complete rewatch of TNG in preparation for the new show, finishing up with Nemesis in January a few days before the premiere. I grew up on TNG and my excitement was through the roof. 

I found Picard to be a solid season of television with some faults throughout, but ultimately satisfying in the end. Despite other people's comments to the contrary, Jean Luc felt very much like Picard to me from the beginning (although changed of course) and it was great to see him become a leader again as the season went on.

Picard season 1 wasn't perfect and I have issues with many aspects of it, from set design to writing decisions, but I always looked forward to each episode and would rate each episode 6 or higher out of 10 (most were probably in the 7 range). Something about the show also felt disjointed from episode to episode at times and I feel like the new characters didn't get enough time to shine/develop. I also think that interesting character aspects, such as Raffi's addiction or most anything about Elnor were completely cut unfortunately. Of course, it has only been 10 episodes so some of these complaints are definitely not fair. I mean look at where the other Trek shows were after 10 episodes!

Prior to the premiere, my expectations were unrealistically very very high. Despite this, I feel like the show mostly met them and I think that says a lot about the great work the writers/directors/cast did.  I also think it is easily Star Trek's best first season.

Bring on season 2!",My Short Picard Review
startrek,"A few months ago I decided to further my Trek education by watching Enterprise. From this subreddit I know it’s not the most popular Trek, but given Voyager is my current favourite, I thought it was worth a watch. I’ll be honest it took me longer to get into, but by the end I’ll admit I liked it. The premise was interesting, and the character development was good. Also Phlox is a delight in every scene he’s in, and as a Brit seeing Reed in Star Trek was very pleasing. 

Anyway, I watched the final episode tonight, and possibly isolation is taking its toll, but I was devastated. Here are my main 3 issues:

1. Simulation
The whole premise of the episode’s story being a holodeck simulation run by Riker really irritated me. The characters I’d grown so attached to being computer programs in their last appearance just felt wrong. His decision to disobey orders was also a league away from Trip’s decision. The whole idea of Riker using a simulation in which he mostly impersonates a chef to make a critical decision just seemed weird.

2. Timing
The timing for the episode was really off. Why did it need to be the day of Enterprise’s decommissioning? Why did it need to be the day of the coalition signing? Six years of adventures just swept over and ignored and it felt very forced. I would have been on board if they fast-forwarded  to the actual forming of the federation, but they didn’t.

3. Trip’s Death 
I know its Trek tradition to kill a major character in a show (Yarr, Kes etc.) but killing them in the last episode is just daft. Especially when its one of the main 3 - the gut punch being entirely negated by it happening a mere 20 minutes before the show ending. What makes character deaths so powerful is watching the characters react and emphasising with them. We got hardly any of that in Trip’s death. It felt so weird and forced I genuinely expected him to emerge from  the shadows and take T’Pol’a hand as Archer gave his speech. 

I understand a lot of my issues stem from it being cancelled before its time. Believe me, I’m no stranger to a rushed ending (I’ve watched BBC’s Merlin) but Enterprise could have ended so perfectly either by just going off into their new adventure (these ARE the voyages) or simply with Archer’s speech in the previous episode.

So there you have it, ramblings about an ending that took place over 10 years ago from someone who barely qualifies as a trekkie. I just wanted to know if the trek community as a whole agreed or disagreed with my view.",Thoughts on Enterprise’s Ending
startrek,"For all people claim that we just want a repeat of TNG, I've never actually seen anyone seriously express this opinion in my 20+ years involvement in this fandom. If anything people criticize ENT and VOY as trying too hard to recreate TNG, and the most popular episodes of those respective shows are the ones that do their own thing.

My issue with Discovery, Picard, and the Bad Robot Films is that they ARE rehashes of the old shows.

Oh boy, another actor to play Spock, another super secret Spock sibling, another super secret Soong family member, tribbles, another evil robot trying to kill the universe, oh boy it's the borg again, oh boy it's klingons again, oh boy it's the mirror universe again, oh boy it's Khan again only he's white this time, oh boy Spock says the Khan line instead of Kirk this time, oh boy it's Sarek again, remember Sarek? I could keep going for days.

Sure, people love to point out episodes like Relics or Unification or Trials and Tribble-ations, but these episodes were exception rather than the rule. By and large Star Trek is not a franchise that references itself often, and even when it does was usually in a way that most people would miss it.

It's notable to me that outside of a couple flashbacks, the Borg never appear in DS9. The Dominon don't show up in VOY or ENT. Outside of a blink and you'll miss it diagram, tribbles never show up in TNG or VOY. These are shows celebrated for their differences rather than their similarities, and the commonalities they do share only serve to enhance the believably of the fictional universe they inhabit. 

I, and I'd wager most Star Trek fans, would have been perfectly happy with a new crew on a new ship boldly going where no man has gone before, commenting on modern political topics like Star Trek has always done. 

Which makes it all the more disappointing that for the last 11 years (and arguably even before that) this franchise has been driving in circles while stuck in first gear, revisiting the same tired characters, same tired tropes, same tired plotlines, and same tired locales. If you took away all the old characters and ""member this"" moments, what would this house of cards have to stand on?

At this point I would be perfectly happy if we never saw Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Tribbles, Klingons, the Borg, Picard, Data, or even the Enterprise itself ever again. I welcome the opportunity for new characters to fall in love with, new ship designs to become my favorite, new iconic aliens to enjoy, and new ideas and political concepts to think about and debate. 

It's a shame I haven't been given the opportunity in a very long time.

If seeing all the old stuff again but with new actors or updated graphics is what does it for you I guess I can't really begrudge you for that. I wish I shared your position, I do like enjoying things believe it or not. But I personally have all my DVD's and BluRays for whenever I wish to relive the past, and more than anything I wish this franchise would give me the opportunity to have new favorites again.",Star Trek is stuck in the past.

startrek,"Early on in the season, I felt that I liked Dahj a lot more than Soji. I thought the feeling was unfounded, they're (almost) the same character, and we barely knew Dahj to begin with. But reflecting on the season as a whole, I feel that the show would have worked a lot better if we'd had Dahj instead of Soji.

Dahj was the everyday character - someone just going about their daily lives, who suddenly has their life upended. She's lost and scared and suddenly apart of something much bigger than she ever imagined. ...A standard sci-fi cliche, sure, but it's standard because it works. Dahj was a bit more relatable and likable for it, whereas Soji had no idea what was going on until 6 episodes in, and then within 1 she had to both come to terms with who she was, and learn to trust Picard. 

Imagine Dahj survives the attempt on her life in the first episode. She now becomes worried for her sister, who she believed worked at a Federation shipyard, but this also turned out to be a lie. Picard promises to help her find and save her sister. 

Dahj is around as the crew is assembled and as they go about looking for Soji. She slowly forms friendships with them in her own way, as she starts to rediscover who she is. At one point she asks Picard about Data, pointing out that with his abilities, he was close to being a perfect human. Picard tells her that Data only used his android abilities when necessary, preferring to do things as humanly as possible. That Data acknowledged that being flawed and imperfect was a significant part of the human experience, as was learning to overcome those flaws.

The Soji/Narek stuff plays out the same, except this time, he successfully kills her. Picard and Dahj get there too late, as the Romulan fleet is off to the Synth homeworld. Dahj is upset over her sister's death, and can't help but to blame Picard. She knows it's unfair, but she can't help but to be disappointed - he promised her, and he let her down.

So when they're on the Synth homeworld, and the other Synths offer her this vision of utopia, she buys into it. She's grieving her sister, disappointed in Picard...what's so great about humans, anyway? They fail and make mistakes and people get hurt because of it.

Picard's appeal to Dahj would then remind her of Data's way of life - accepting failure and flaws, and learning to overcome them. How learning to grow from past mistakes is a part of being human. This would inspire her to believe in Picard and shut down the beacon. And give more weight to the sacrifice Picard was willing to make for her.",Picard: The other sister was better...

I have stomached a lot of *hilariously* awful ST plots throughout all the series so far, and nothing in them could have prepared me for how genuinely intolerable and unlikable every character in ENT has been so far. Does it get *any* better for people who are similarly rolling their eyes at the portrayal of the women on the show (not just sexualization tbh) and generally annoyed by the combative nature of everyone on the crew? DS9 and Voyager didn't always have crews be agreeable, cooperative, or even likeable, but it usually was the sum of a compelling plot point, theme, or a character flaw rather than the characters *being the flaw*.

I know the show is already polarizing but ST to me is about philosophy and intellectually stimulating plots, which remain pertinent in the writing even during long war arcs in DS9 or in interpersonal soapy drama episodes of every series. It just doesn't seem like that's in ENT at all. It's like they wanted to make the most boring Michael Bay aspiring sci-fi possible. Is there any hope or should I just skip it? I might go back to it during a less stressful time when I can make ""Space George W. Bush"" into more of a case study but these days I need to actually watch good TV if I watch any at all. I am still laughing at the idea that people actually made this show and that seemingly every single decision about it so far has been completely wrong in the context of Star Trek writing and worldbuilding and characterization.

startrek,"Hey all, I was just realizing this after watching them back-to-back. Here's what I noticed:


* We have both Picard and The Doctor traveling from and among their three different times periods.

* In both shows, there is a being causing their time shifting who is also standing judgment on them: Q/Rose Tyler (Bad Wolf)(The Moment)


* In both, the oldest looking version causes the cataclysm (Grandpa/Old Picard)

* At some point, multiple copies of the Enterprise and TARDIS have to team up to achieve their mission


Can't think of more than that. Just thought it was notable.

startrek,"So my friend and I were recently discussing movies and Star Trek. I posed the question to him: What are some of the best Star Trek movies that aren't actually Star Trek movies? That is, movies that could totally be great Star Trek movies if they had originally been written into the universe.

Two we came up with immediately were:

* Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)
* Galaxy Quest (1999)

Obviously Galaxy Quest is a bit on the nose but I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas. A quick internet search didn't help much so I figured I'd pose the question here.",Best non-Trek Trek Movies
startrek,"I just looked on my Youtube feed and saw a video titled ""Why Star Trek Picard FAILED"" with some 200k views. Instead of linking to it, I'm going to go on a moderately tilted rant.

The people who make these videos are not fans of Star Trek. They exist to farm your views for their own benefit (money).

There is no evidence to support that Picard did bad. Make your own judgments on whether or not you liked it. Every single influencer out there seems to bee unrealistically critical of a show that I enjoyed heavily, and it's creating a toxic (for the lack of a better word, sorry) environment where if TNG came out today, it would be seen as a bad show.

I don't know what these people are expecting, and honestly I don't care.","Star Trek Picard did not ""Fail"", it was in fact a magnificent success (sorry, rant)."
startrek,"1. Filled with incredibly empty 'reluctant hero' gestures: Seven of Nine, Raffi, Rios, and Elnor all had instant ""100% I will not... Okay, I'll go"" moments. This is a problem of writing. Raffi did this shit 3 times.

2. Romulans don't behave like Romulans. It is obvious this is a problem of direction. They behave like humans with some prosthetic ears. The actors appear to be given no guidance as to how a Romulan carries themselves in all other trek.

3. Modern Stylistic/Content choices like: more camera movement, lens flair, hot characters having sexy time, everything looks Green Screen... are okay to have, if it suits the narrative. Instead the camera seems to listlessly move to capture a cool angle when the moment doesn't call for it. This is the problem with Michael Bay. ""Every shot is given equal weight visually."" If everything is of max importance, nothing is important. (Why is it So Hard to Remember What Happens in Transfomers? by Lindsay Ellis provides a perfect example why this is a bad use of film language)

4. Lack of philosophy with an overabundance of attempts to seem profound. This has gotten better in later episodes.

5. At this point it doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. This is a different show. I understand that. Enterprise didn't really feel like Star Trek some of the time to me. But this has very fleeting moments of being Star Trek. Like it is just using the Trek mythology and world very little at that.

6. Picard is not inspiring. This is very jarring to a Star Trek fan and to me diminishes the whole point of the show. This has gotten better in later episodes and perhaps this is a part of the narrative growth for Picard.

7. It ignores the history of the galaxy. Voyagers return and the Dominion War have had no mention or seemingly no impact on geopolitical nature of the Galaxy. 

8. Not talking to the computer and hearing the computer respond is such an atmospheric Star Trek thing that is absent here.

9. Elnor should not have been convinced to leave but rather trying to convince Picard to go with him. This was backwards.

10. Soji &amp; Narek sleep on a way too small bed.

&amp;#x200B;

What Picard is doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Transformation of the Borg to a defeated resource that scavengers are exploiting is really amazing.

2. Agnes is perfect. Her character has been told perfectly so far. The reveal of her romantic connection with Maddox was handled, beautifully and provided my first moment of real emotional devistation. 

3. The EMH's have a similar dynamic that made the Voyager EMH doctor such a good character.

4. The Innari bodyguard (Vop) is a great Star Trek type species. Distinctly NOT Human. Maybe there should be more of this?

5. The Federation fucking itself up so badly by devolving into racism and shitty self-important leaders, would seem impractical... if it wasn't happening so vividly in real life. This is a big plus.

6. The conspiracy unraveling itself is an example of good writing. The ban, the federation, the Romulans hatred of Synthetics. All interesting questions.

7. Stardust City Rag was the first very good episode because of the swerve involving Sevens past with the Freecloud Boss (a very good villain btw). The costuming, the atmosphere, even the pacing was star trek and more importantly good storytelling. When Agnes did the thing at the end (another perfect and justified swerve) I was flabberghasted and all-in.

All together its seems like it will be a weak first season. But this is on par with ALL the other treks. They seem to need time to get their footing.

startrek,"Ever since I watched First Contact as a kid, I've always wondered why using 21st century weapons against the Borg were never fully explored. JL seemed to take them out with a holographic Tommy gun with the safeties off, but it was never talked about again. I'd think  of you ship is boarded guns might work for a bit longer before the Borg adapt, I bet they wouldn't be used to metal projectiles being thrown at them when they've been dealing with energy weapons for a long time. So does 21st century weaponry stand a chance longer than phasers or Photon Torpedoes?",Do you think the Borg could adapt to projectile weapons given some time?
startrek,"Why is it that they figured out how to give holograms human/bio experiences to characters like The Doctor from Voyager (e.g., emotions, humor) but couldn't program those into synths like Data and the others responsible for the Mars attacks until this far into the series?

startrek,"Picard aired and people were excited. Ive liked science fiction for a long while, but really only in movies. I got bored on the 3rd episode of Picard or so. I just thought it felt bland, self congratulatory, and uninspired (ahem, mass effect). 

THE GOOD: This got me thinking. Why do people even like star trek? So I decided I would give it a chance. I went with DS9 because ive always heard it was darker...... WOW WOW WOW WOW. Two weeks later I feel like ive learned so much about myself, I've questioned morality in a macro or micro way (sisko with the poison gas/pale moonlight), and I have witnessed some of the finest performances on tv or cinema. 

People like game of thrones??? The emissary, dukat, the great link, and all the rest of the amazing puzzle pieces were on the verge of perfection to me. Sisko and Dukat are a tour de force imo almost always. 

Next up TNG: Again, incredible in different ways. Its safe to say now I want to watch the OS and Voyager, and anything else good. 

I consider myself lucky. I got a chance to see some of the best media ever produced. Soley because today's attempt at emulating it is so beyond poor. Picard is not Star Trek.

startrek,"I feel like star trek has gotten so much attention from hollywood lately with the movies and the discovery reboot but now i see st:picard to the end and i cant help to think all of these writers are a cynical and pessimistic bunch of people. Apart from the format in which it presents itself, a serialized story rather than each episode being a standalone adventure, i find that the writers of the movies and the new series cant seem to do justice to universe that gene rodenberry imagined. He seemed to think the future for the human race held great advancements morally and intellectually that just seems to be lost in the new shows. The new shows seem to be just walking dead in space. A bunch of asshole people being assholes all over space. I remember watching star trek TNG and picard in those key moments where his humanity beat the odds an the temptation of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons and i incorporated those moments as part of my moral compass. They were so comoelling and so inspiring but i hate to say i dont feel inspired anymore. I feel like the shows entertain my apetite for great cgi and fantastic acting by patrick stewart. I had such high hopes to get more of those jaw dropping goosebump generating moments and in the end it was entertaining but it gave me nothing near the feeling of a revolutionary way of thinking or behaving such as captain picard used to.

I’ve only gotten around to watching DS9 recently on Netflix and was completely blown away by the episode “Duet” in season 1. It involves a Cardassian who comes to the station.

Im about 6 episodes into the 2nd season and so far I like it, and the 2nd season in my opinion, is loads better than the first season. Thanks to Captain Pike, easily my favorite character of the series. He reminds me of the standard Starfleet Captain that we have come to expect, a quirky but noble leader. 

Is it perfect? No but I dont think its as bad as people make it out to be. I like Burnham, Pike, Tilly and Soru. I feel like their another fine crew much like previous Trek shows. The production quality is very good, the sets look amazing in my opinion. Its really nice seeing a Trek show with modern quality production between the sets, CGI, costumes, and action choreography. 

I love all the easter eggs and references to past Trek and there are a lot of them despite people claiming the new showrunners dont know Star Trek.

My wife and I are watching DS-9 - we are both Star Trek fans and have watched pretty much every other series.  We have tried DS-9 in the past and just faded away and started watching something else.  Having said that, it is regularly billed as one of the best Star Trek series around, so we thought we'd give it another go.

We are up to Season 1 Episode 16 and we have been struggling.   The episode where Jake and Nod buy  Cardassian yamok sauce?   We skipped it entirely.  Boring and cringey.

Some of the acting is excruiciating.  Watching Avery Brookes as he ""Enunciates.  Every.  Word.  In.  A.  Sentence"".  Some of the character motivations are hard to understand (Hey, Bashir, we get that you like Dax, but can't you take a hint).  Some of the plot lines end up feeling a bit cringeworthy.

Every Star Trek series took a season or so to get going - TNG wasn't brilliant in its first season, it always felt like an 80s TOS to me but once it got its legs, it was great.  Voyager was stronger in its first season, but also improved over time.  

We aren't quite ready to give up yet, but when does it get good?",Watching DS-9 and struggling
startrek,"In the years after Enterprise, I had two good ideas for Star Trek. One was just a *NEXT* Next Generation. Go on more adventures, with well written stories. I fully reject the concept of Franchise Fatigue. The problem with Trek back then was that the shows simply got bad. But that's not what this is about....

The second idea I had was to have a show that was about the origins of the Borg. But my idea was that it wouldn't be labeled as that. Or even called a Star Trek show. It would be a ""general"" sci fi show about the future that at the end would surprise you by the people in the show ending up becoming the borg.

Today, we are all stuck at home for months. Luckily we have enough technology that we can connect with each other virtually which is good. We are all adjusting our lives so that we can do our jobs and do what we need to do, while minimizing direct contact.

What a great seed for a borg origin story. A virus forces everyone to stay apart and connect electronically. In a civilization with much more advanced technology, and with a quarantine that lasts hopefully a lot longer than our is going to, our every deepening personal connections to the internet could evolve into a collective.",This would make a great borg origin story
startrek,"I'm watching ""What We Left Behind"" and the response of DS9 at the time and it's very similar to the reaction that Picard just received. Here's the thing, though, cussing aside, DS9 was waaaay darker in tone than Picard. 

 One of the heroes was a former terrorist who showed no regret for her actions, in fact she's proud of them ffs. They even mention in the documentary that they wouldn't be able to get away with some of that stuff today. Not to mention that some of the decisions Sisko made during the Dominion War. Hell, the Dominion War itself. If Nostalgic fanboys are shitting themselves over a Starfleet admiral swearing, imagine their reaction at how Sisko handled the Maquis!

  I smirked when one of the hate letters they read called DS9 ""too politically correct."" The more shit changes the more it stays the same.",How do you think DS9 would've been received today?
startrek,"It happened to coincide that I watched during the same week the finale of both Picard ans DS9. The interesting thing was how similar both endings were in terms of messed-up events with bad editing. 

I found Picard more ambitious since it inherits 33-year long Data's storyline, extending Soongs, too. The clash between the fleets felt like a true Star Trek (that classic tension on-screen between the adversaries), but it lasted only seconds. And the death of Picard might have been explored far deeper providing he had died several times during TNG (we DO KNOW how and who could ""restore"" Jean-Luc in his genuine human sleeve). I could only imagine how the series would have looked like if not under Kurtzman production...

In DS9, the ending was mostly anticipated, but implemented a bit better. It managed to wrap up multiple arcs, although in a bit unnatural and puzzling way (and one in just appaling). Sometimes it felt like 4- or-5-episode long story was chopped off awkwardly missing many emotional scenes. Fortunately, far less that in Picard.

In both series, we didn't see the ultimate battle of/with supernatural beings - the major flaw IMO. But unlike the Prophets from DS9, we weren't explained convincingly what was the danger/nature of ""the makers of the Admonition"" in Picard.

I mentioned bad endings for some characters in DS9, but it was dictated by the fact of 7-season long build-up. In Picard, such flaw was of much larger scale: why the hell noone noticed the disappearance of Narek? Why Agnes suddenly dodged the justice of murdering Bruce Maddox? The logic of Soji was just random, she behaves in final episode like drunken teenager who also have bipolar disorder.

The coherence of the events were flawed sometimes in horrendous way.  Picard and Agnes escaped the synthetic guards, walked towards the cube, had a talk, repaired the ship, launched up in front of the Romulan fleet that all the time was doing what?... Meanwhile Soong just busy with routine data extraction and Seven probably meditating over her killing Narissa. 

In this aspect DS9 is even worth: we saw two characters chatting around in a cave - like a 15-minute scene, when a long Galactic-scale battle is raged far away, then ended, the whole fleet went back to docks, war-ending formalities had been made and even a nice party held at Fontain's holosuite... not to mention Sisko suddenly becoming a Jedi who knows how to find exact spot on Bajor to face the enemy who's expects him doing just that!

To sum up, Picard was a bad series which ended up in awckwardly good, ""acceptable"" way. What You Leave Behind, instead, is a tight kaleidoscope, not bad yet still not enough for a brilliant saga.

I enjoyed Et in Arcadia Ego a bit more, mostly emotionally. Despite hating Discovery and all this dung associated with Kurtzman.

What would you say?",Picard's vs DS9 endings?
startrek,"After seeing the trailer for season 3 of Discovery, i was pretty excited, but some memory in the back of my head was bugging me. It took me a while to retrieve it, but then I remembered Kevin Sorbo doing a slow kick around a black hole and it all came back to me. Andromeda: a sci fi series about a crew from a United ""commonwealth"" of planets, flung into the future where their peace loving system of intragalactic government had failed, trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild a better future. All based on unused story ideas by, what was his name? Ah here it is...Gene Roddenberry. Sound familiar? 

I was surprised to find out the show had 5 seasons! I watched it a lot and liked it as a kid, but I really remember almost nothing from it now.

startrek,"So I've had some thoughts after the end of Picard S1, Discovery, the history of Star Trek, the vociferous fanbase, and some issues regarding modern ST creation. I'm going to keep this short so hopefully discussion can happen.

• Modern Star Trek is being made in season-long story arcs because the production company never knows if the plug will be pulled. This to me is sad.  Picard S1 was good, I liked it, but man that whole season could be the entire series. Seven becoming interim queen should have had much more drama around it. Now we're going to get another season of rushed storytelling simply because the writers are likely barred from planning that far out. Can you imagine if in DS9 the Dominion War was only allowed to be one season? It causes rushed story telling, and the overall thing suffers.  
  \- Discovery does this too. Its becoming a theme with ST.

• I really DO love what they're doing though. They are truly creating some proper fan service by going deep in the lore. I love that, there's an entire universe to utilize, no reason to keep making new enemies, things, and what not.

• All in all I'm happy with modern ST. Even with rushed story telling, I'm happy we're seeing modern trek. I do worry the fanbase will serve to destabilize this all though. We need to collectively regulate ourselves.","Many problems, many strengths. Contains general spoilers."

I don't buy the Romulans backing down in the finale of *Picard*. Like, if they seriously believe that the synths are going to bring about a galactic apocalypse, than no way are they going to back down just because of a Picard speech about their rights as sapients and a comparably-sized Federation fleet. If they really believe that the galaxy will be destroyed if they don't act, they absolutely would have opened fire on the fleet and attempted to break through to destroy the planet.

Plus, the synths DID IN FACT ACTIVATE the beacon summoning the genocidal extra-galactic AIs, which would absolutely convince the Romulans that they were right all along in their fear of them. And Narek spent that time narrating the Romulan myth of streets being flooded with the blood and entrails of the innocent because these machines.

Despite the fact that Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor it's just too hard to accept that he is a younger version of Patrick Stewart. They have nothing in common. Their voices sound nothing alike, they have totally different accents, different lips, and their facial structure is completely different. They tried to explain this away by saying that Shinzon was disfigured but last time I checked no amount of fighting will give you fuller lips. In fact they only thing that they even had in common at all is that they were both bald although that didn't even make any sense seeing as every time we have seen young Picard had hair.

startrek,"First of all, I really like Voyager so far, but hear me out.

The most obvious offender is Chakotay. It seems all he does is talk about his Native American heritage, which would be weird enough in any show, but seems especially odd in Star Trek when we are supposed to be in a post-nations post-racial future. There is a TOS episode where Abraham Lincolm remarks about Uhuru being integrated into the crew, but Kirk and all the others are so advanced in their thinking they can't even understand what Lincoln is talking about.

This would be less of an issue if Chakotay has a more defined character, but after watching a season and a half all I can tell you about him is basically a series of Native American cliches, with none of the characterization you would expect from a leader of rebels.

He's a pretty common complaint, and I get that the writers were scammed but a fake consultant, but I think theres a few other odd issues in Voyager.

The character of Tuvak seems vaguely racist to me in that the show runners seemed to think that simply making a vulcan black was a character trait. I mean its great to have a diverse cast, but so far there is nothing to differentiate him from Spock, or any other generic Vulcan, except for his skin color. It almost seems to me, the showrunners said, hey lets have a black vulcan, and then stopped writing there. Contract this to the great characterization of Geordi, whose skin color is literally irrelevant to his character. I can tell you that he is a good friend, probably the nicest TNG character, and bad with the ladies. I cant tell you a whole lot about Tuvak.

Please note im not really complaining or calling Voyager racist really. Most of this I think is just mediocre writing. I just find it interesting that it was clearly well intentioned but went wrong, and wrong in ways previous crews from earlier eras didn't go as wrong.

It would have been a little bit more cooler to see Rikers new ship to come swooping in to save the day like how the Enterprise E did in First Contact when the Borg invasion on Earth was happening.

Cmder Oh then claims she has a small fleet on standby near earth ready to seed earth's atmosphere with poisonous radiation if they do so. Riker accuses her of bluffing. She reminds him she infiltrated the deepest reaches of Star Fleet and no one was the wiser, it would be foolish to assume she is bluffing. 

Stand off. 

Picard chimes in and proposes that the communication tower to call Cthulhu is destroyed, all tech and info related to it is destroyed, and that the knowledge of the ability to call the interdimensional destroyers is completely erased from the memory banks of all synths. 

The Synths have a conference and accept this under once condition - The Federation remove the synth ban and give synths full citizenship. 

Picard talks to Federation big wigs, they agree. 

AI Soong oversees the procedure as one after another of the synths has the knowledge permanently removed and all the tech is destroyed. ONce that happens, Cmdr Oh is satisfied, she backs down and returns. 

This way everyone (mostly) gets what they want and the Romulans are not portrayed as 2 dimensional bad guys which bothered me.

Say there’s a Betazoid in StarFleet whose job was to make contact with new life. If they could read their minds, wouldn’t it just be gibberish to them?
 The universal translator wouldn’t affect their thoughts presumably.
So how then can they seemingly read the minds of nearly anyone without the issue of a language barrier?

Side note considering it takes them until adolescence to develop their abilities, do you think the children try to lie? At least to each other? Or is it just so completely alien to them that they wouldn’t consider it?

startrek,"TL;DR - The way she saves the day is by using her abilities to effectively steer Picard away from bad decision making (especially within his specialty of negotiations), to make him aware of things he would otherwise not be able to perceive, and to essentially save the crew from disaster by avoiding it in the first place rather than solving the crisis after it's a problem.

Many people in this fandom seem to view Troi less than favourably. I won't speak to any reasons other than frequent mentions of her generally not being very useful.

I know a lot of you will be prompted to disagree that this is the case, but we can only speak from personal experience and this is the point of view I'm coming from so if all you're going to say is ""what? everyone I know loves her"", I hear you, save your effort.

I'm rewatching TNG and it's occurred to me why this might be, even though in my opinion it is wrong. It seems like there's a key difference in how Troi is useful as opposed to the other characters around her.

For example, Data, Geordi and Crusher tend to chew on a problem and propose or create actionable solutions to solve the main crisis.

Picard likes to have a last-minute revelation and think or talk his way out of a problem, while Riker and Worf tend to be more action-oriented and reactive in their heroics. All these characters often get their moments in a very memorabel, climactic way.

I don't think it can be overstated how useful Troi is, just in a way more subtle and totally different way. Her moments aren't as easy to remember, but they are way more frequent than most other characters.

Sure, sometimes she doesn't have very much to offer when asked her opinion (I won't get into how that is also useful sometimes) but it's worth noting that she is indeed repeatedly asked.

Often she has helpful insight, which may seem obvious points to us based on storytelling clues but are at least helpful in confirming what Picard may be guessing at.

But more frequently, she is actively useful in bringing forth new information the crew wouldn't have otherwise, including sensing certain things on an entirely imperceptible level to the rest of them. They'd be screwed without her in many cases.

Her abilities can't be overlooked. I don't need to walk anyone through why her abilities are useful in theory, any level of mind reading is obviously an asset. But I've never seen anyone go out of their way to point out how finely tuned her senses are, sometimes she is very specific in her descriptions (even though the meme is that she is always vague, or else just stating the obvious).

Not only are they specific, they're also broad and powerful. She can feel and sense things thousands of kilometers away, from thousands of individual complex entities at a time. On top of everyone in the ship around her. That would take incredible strength to handle and would make her an incredibly useful asset especially in her job which, by the way, is also a very necessary thing to have on a ship out in space that long even if it were a position filled by a human.

This won't be news to most of you but I know some people need to hear it.",In defense of Troi
startrek,"As is well known at this point, the premise of Breaking Bad was simple: turn Mr. Chips into Scarface. But how it would be done or what would happen along the way wasn't predetermined. Instead, the writers wrote organically. As described in countless behind-the-scenes podcasts and interviews, in determining how to create the story, the writers simply asked themselves episode to episode, ""Where's a character's head at?"" and ""What happens next?"" The television equivalent of one-step-at-a-time. This way, character choices and plot moves seem plausible, and the characters gain depth.
Contrast this with Star Trek: Picard, which seems to have been created with a checkbox approach. We need to get them from here to here, so what can we come up with to make that happen? Or we want to establish this about this character, so what can we come up with to show that? Check, check, check. This approach is what leads to moments not feeling earned. This is how you end up with plot holes. This is how you end up with thinly-written characters, poor pacing, and coincidences that are too hard to believe. I am certain that 80% of the problems that people have with this show are the casualties of this writing approach. The most blatant example to me is Elnor. He's fine as a character, but there's no reason he needs to be on the crew other than the writers decided it would be cool to have someone like him round out the team. And what you end up with is this huge detour to pick him up, some maudlin backstory to establish their relationship, and some forced drama about whether Elnor will go with him or not. Another example is the writers wanting to establish that Raffi has some past demons to contend with. Insert dramatic scene with son. Check.
If you're going to revolve a whole television series around a character, and declare upfront that it's meant to be a slower, character-driven show, then the writing approach should match. As it is right now, it's like the show is constructed by patchwork, and I can feel and see every seam. ",Recommendation to Picard's showrunners: adopt Breaking Bad's approach to writing.
startrek,"I'm currently rewatching DS9 and have just had the finale to the Marquis saga.


I realized that the way the Federation handle the Marquis is very familiar, because it's exactly how the Fedration handle the Synth ban. 

In my opinion, the Federation has been on this path for a long time. The cracks were there even in DS9. And all this makes me appreciate Picard that much more.

\-Picard and Data scenes bookending the season were amazing

\-Picard and Data heartfelt goodbye -  so grateful as a fan to have this scene

\-Nepenthe was a brilliant updating of ""Family"" and is already one of my all time fav Star Trek eps. The Rikers are now the safe place Picard comes home to. The warmth and love between the TNG characters was everything I could have wanted, an anti-All Good Things future.  Writing/acting of Riker/Troi was perfect.

\-Seven! Hugh! Hugh and Picard's reunion was such an unexpected moment in this series and so satisfying

\-Rios, Raffi, Zhaban, and Laris are great new characters

\-Patrick Stewart is one of the great actors of our time and was suburb. His interpretation of Picard at this stage of his life is genius. Bitter about how Starfleet ended for him, yet relaxed after years of being away from the pressures of command.

\-Picard learned to love kids over time - wonderful! Elnor episode and relationship were great, cant wait to see more

A couple of friends made this home movie looking series (maybe like three or four vids in total) with a Star Trek playset and some action figures. All I remember is the crew was a bunch of fuckups who'd get people killed due to negligence and Picard was a deranged psychopath -think Captain Murphy from Sealab- and would do shit like ride around in a wheelchair because he was lazy hypochondriac, and installed an absurd number of railings and ramps all over the bridge that got in everyone's way and caused people to actually get hurt.

It wasn't stop-motion or anything fancy. These guys would just grab the toys and wave them around as if they were playing, but you never saw anything more than their hands, and the situations they came up with were like something out of It's Always Sunny, except way more fucked up.

(Did they prioritize the budget for Discovery?? If so, that was a mistake…) And now with all the other series announced (that nobody asked for or really cares about.) I can’t help but think that the producers/CBS are intentionally or unintentionally diluting the quality of Star Trek so they can pump out all these extra series.

I think that Star Trek should be run by producers who truly care and understand the show and are fans themselves. They should choose one or two stories that audiences would love best and invest their budget and time there.

startrek,"Just in case you don't know: Mass Effect is a series of computer/console games. The Storyline is, that every 50k years an outergalactic species arrives and kills all species with a certain level of technology. These aliens are called ""The Reaper"".

During the first three games we, as gamer, found out about the threat, about the background of the reason why the reaper do what they do and even meet someone who witnessed the last ""purge"" (stasis is a hell of a tech). Long story short: Organics built tech, tech became consious, both fight, organics loose, tech hibernates for 50k to kill everything that could be a threat... repeat.

At the end of the third game  we face 3 different endings:

1. Destroy the reapers and ALL (!) synthetic life, even the friendly one
2. the hero(ess) takes control over the reapers, in exchange for sacrificing his/her body. The hero becomes an AI himself/herself and the reapers become ""slaves""
3. Synthesis of organic and synthetic life forms. All lifeforms (organic and synth) merge and form new lifeforms (but they keep the apperiance). In fact, Humans e.g. end up as creatures like Picard is at the end of Season 1.

startrek,"I think I've got a different take on Picard... and it relates back to Discovery and the Kelvin timeline.

I went in to Picard with HIGH hopes, and was fully let down, but I couldn't identify why. I think all new generation of ST content has become ""Star Wars"" more than ""Star Trek"". Many people argue, ""Hey old man, the new ST is great! It makes it more accessible to new fans! Just be happy to grow the base!""

I'm actually **happy** there are people who enjoy the new content. That's nice! But old ST was in a totally different genre than Star Wars. To grossly oversimplify, Star Wars is an underdog story. (Bear with me... please forget what you've heard about ""the hero's journey"" which I argue is just an epic version of the underdog story). When you look at Star Wars... or Fast-and-Furious... or Avengers... it's all about being the underdog. The protagonist(s) fight against an impossible foe and then rise above all obstacles overcome the big-evil. It's a great conceit. It's why the new ST is so accessible for new fans. Who doesn't love a good underdog story?

But that's not classic ST. TOS crew were explorers... and they had confidence. They were part of the noble Federation. They may be isolated, and get into trouble because they were on the frontier, but BEHIND THEM was the full weight (and moral fortitude) of the Federation. The story basically set itself up as... ""okay, we've solved all those other basic conflicts in life. There's no push for basic survival, or wealth, or power, or resources. Now we focus on exploring what's-out-there, and at the same time we explore what-it-means-to-be-human, what-we-can-aspire-to-be."" (Exploring both inner and outer space).

So why the new ST iterations are disappointing *for me* is that I went in with different expectations. It'd be like walking into the next Fast And The Furious and getting a light-hearted rom-com. Or going to see the next Avengers movie and getting a teen coming-of-age-story. Even if the rom-com F&amp;F was faaaaantastic, I'd wager the folks that walked in there expecting high-octane action would be let down.

So in conclusion, I'm **happy** that new fans can get a story line they find exciting and engaging while watching Disco, Picard, or Kelvin. I'm happy there's people that can get to know Kirk, Picard and Burnham^(\*ahem\*), and see them as heroes. I wouldn't want to take that away from anyone. I personally don't find Star Wars all that engaging, but look at the fan base! I'm stoked all those folks can find so much joy in the SW saga. I just hope at some point there will be more content (Star Trek or otherwise) that focuses on the human element of exploration, and doesn't feel the need to make another underdog story.",Picard is not my Star Trek (and that's okay)

startrek,"Am I the only one who finds that the ships on 'Picard' and 'Discovery' look really different from the Trek designs in the TNG/DS9/VOY era?

The ship designs in TNG era by Andrew Probert, Greg Jein, Rick Sternbach were in my opinion elegant, weighty and memorable. Think of the designs for the Enterprise-D Galaxy-class, Romulan D'deridex, Klingon Vor'cha. They were instantly memorable, beautiful to look at from every angle.

And you could trace each ships' design language back to the classic era Star Trek ships - the Vor'cha class was an evolution of the iconic K't'inga class from The Motion Picture and TOS tv show. The Galaxy class and (its contemporary Starfleet ships) were an evolution from the TOS Constitution class, adopting the graceful curves of the movie-era Excelsior, Miranda and Oberth classes. Even the D'deridex took the TOS 'bird' motif and made it into a literal 'Bird-of-Prey' personified.

Throughout the TNG-DS9-VOY-ENT history, Star Trek has always followed and honored a consistent design language. You can see this rule followed in the rest of the lesser seen ships - the Nebula-class science ships, Akira-class battleships, the Olympic-class (Pasteur) medical ships, the Klingon Negh'var ships and even the runabouts and various shuttlecrafts that launched from the Ent-D and Voyager shuttlebays.

For a show that is happy to build on / make money off of us fans' (enormous) goodwill from the Star Trek canon, the new VFX / Starship design team seems perfectly content to piss on Star Trek's rich design history, and come up uglier and more forgettable designs. I got my first taste of this with Discovery, when the Federation and Klingon ships were a bunch of clashing colors, all-too-busy design details that belonged more in a Michael Bay Transformer robot travesty, than on any recognizable Star Trek.

I had hoped that Picard would turn the tide, and bring us a long-awaited return to the TNG-design language, but the ship designs for the La Sirena, Riker's 200 copy-pasted fleet, and to a lesser extent the Zhat Vash's Romulan fleet all had forgettable designs that made me think they were made quickly, digitally, in a mercenary fashion. They did not seem crafted lovingly by their sculptors from hand, as I'm sure Probert, Sternbach and Jein had to, in the 80s and 90s. Many in our subreddit pointed out that Riker's fleet looked like a poor digital kitbash of Star Trek Online ships, and I have to agree.

Every time I see ships in 'Discovery' or 'Picard', I have to wince a little at the poor, bland, or messy designs and try to paint over it with better designs in my head. Surely the shuttlecraft in 2399 flying over the Golden Gate Bridge cannot look worse than the ones in TNG S2-S7? And surely they don't have to sport bright red spots of paint that make them look like off-brand imitations of the real thing? This reminds me of how the J.J. Abrams TIE Fighters added unnecessary spots streaks of paint, making them worse than the iconic TIE Fighters of the original SW trilogy.

Without an explanation for the regressions in design, I'm forced to conclude that either Star Trek's new batch of VFX people are incompetent ship designers, or they have little to no respect for the Star Trek history and ships that became before, and are determined to force in their own, original lesser stamps on the franchise.

And speaking of VFX, how is it that hand phasers in 'Picard' have reverted to bullet-style pulses? Is it because assault rifles are in vogue in today's world, so 2399 uses pulse weapons too?

And in the few moments we see traditional 'sustained' phaser beams used in starship battles on 'Picard', they sound tinnier/wimpier than the phaser sounds from the TNG-VOY era. In addition to losing VFX language, did the 'Picard' team lose the sound .wav files from the TNG era too, or did they think their new sound effects were superior?

It's all very baffling, and these poor design choices gnaw at me during my watches of 'Picard' and 'Discovery'. When Wil Wheaton interviews the VFX designer for 'Picard' and presumably 'Discovery', who seems rather proud of his messy VFX work, I find myself actively hating on that person, and wishing I could punch them in the face and give them a wake up call.

I don't believe that CBS skimped on their budget to make the ships beautiful. The production values on both 'Discovery' and 'Picard' seem movie-quality. It seems like no expense was spared. And the big piles of cash Netflix and Amazon Prime forked over for exclusive global streaming rights surely would have paid for a good VFX team.

I don't want to dump on the VFX team too much. I do think the holographic controls used in 2399 Starfleet are a good update to the starship consoles we saw on TNG-DS9-VOY. And Rios/Cristobal manages to make those controls look cool while piloting the La Sirena.",Starship designs and VFX on 'Picard' and 'Discovery'
startrek,"I’m a huge Ned Gen fan and I think I would really enjoy watching either/both VOY and DS9. However I find it really hard to get into new shows. The way my partner got me into watching TNG was by showing me a few of the coolest episodes. This way I knew I was in for a great adventure and I was willing to go through season 1-2 to get to the stuff. 

Im hoping you all can do the same thing for me with these other series. 

Tell me an awesome episode or 2 from these two series that will get me excited to get into it.",Suggest me an episode to get me excited about watching either VOY or DS9
startrek,"because Patrick Stewart sees something great in the show's potential. He believed in it enough to bring back his character after twenty years. I would say I see that potential in a lot of the cast. Like others have said, I would totally watch a show starring Rios. I also know the show has a finite end, so that gives me some hope.

What's frustrating is the writing, which I know is a big deterrent for a lot of folks. It's obvious to me that the writers are trying to find their footing in the vast Star Trek universe and had bumps along the road. I also think the show would have been much better if it wasn't 10 episodes, and was the traditional 20-22 per season because the pacing would have made more sense. However, given the budget of the show it doesn't seem like that was realistic. 

And at the end of the day, how many of us sat through the first seasons of TNG? Voyager? DS9? All the first seasons of those series were hard to watch for me. I genuinely believe season 2 will be better and hopefully they'll look over the scripts. It would be great if they brought in some of the writers from DS9 too. Just my two cents.",The reason I keep watching Picard is...
startrek,"Data’s life

I’m not sure if all would agree but the way data chose to die seemed a bit premature. I’m not sure but by the time of nemesis we don’t know how much and how long data was able to experience humanity with his emotion chip. So whatever Maddox put together to keep data alive doesn’t necessarily mean he was experiencing humanity. Am I missing something? 
I feel like he had so much more to experience, especially in such a big galaxy and rich universe with so much to learn. Data character had so many experiences waiting for him I feel....",Data’s lifespan
startrek,"To be blunt I didn't like Picard very much. I went in with high hopes that were killed off after the first episode. Remembrance was like a new spin on a favorite comfort food. There was enough nostolgia to scratch that itch and enough newness that made it feel different to TNG. Episodes 1-3 were mostly pleasant and then for me it fell off a cliff, with each coming episode a rock hitting me on the way down. 

If it wasnt for for the old cast and crew of TNG and VOY I wouldn't even have watched the rest of the season. None of the new characters had time to breath and develop. Agnes was forgettable. Rios was just another hot headed Latino stereotype ala Po in the Star Wars sequels. Raffi downright creeped me the hell out for some reason. I found her switching from drunken junkie to mother figure (while well acted and would totally work in something like Moonlight) out of place and jarring in this show. Seven I felt was reduced down into kick-ass token LGBT character who for some reason without any development or explanation is hooking up with Raffi? 

And finally there is the man himself Picard who is a broken down husk of himself. The man who was assimilated by the Borg, lived a lifetime in 20 seconds, and saved the Galaxy from certain doom numerous times now is told to fuck off at every chance and is berated in front of the entire galaxy on the evening news. Most of the time Picard in this new series took a backseat turning into a secondary character on his own damn show. The only times when I began to become slightly engaged with his character was when there were TNG call backs and in the finale when he took command of La Sirena (which made me smile).

I get it that all of the characters are suffering through some sort of trauma and the message of how we as individuals and as a society can become cold and distant after trauma is utterly brilliant. It's far better than TNG's Troi rape of the week and move on. But the format of ten episodes completely kills any chances of meaningful character interaction. It's structure is go go go and two minutes of heavy crying. The show didn't feel contemplative like it was advertised, it was a two hour blockbuster movie with eight hours tacked on to blow the special effects budget. Not once did I feel that the main cast was a crew, everyone felt like asshole grifters coming together for a paycheck from the old man. When Picard was dying all I could keep thinking was ""please no, not here with these people!"".

Compare that to Discovery which I didn't like that much either for reasons already well known but had it's moments even in the first episode of season 1.  It was apparent that the crew of the Shenzhou were a family and Michael betrayed that trust to her crew and the federation as a whole. Throughout season 1 she works to regain the trust of her family in both Saru and the federation.  Season 1 also had a great bottle episode ""Magic to make the sanest man go mad"" and the other away mission episode with the sentient resonance plants. Season two worked on that Bond between the crew with scenes like the auto antonym game between Lionel and Reno. Or even the humble brag Michael messaged to Tilly regarding her command test scores. Hopefully season three continues building on that good foundation.

Call me stuck in the past but Star Trek really works when the crew is a family. What made TOS so unique to other Scifi is that the Enterprise was not only a spaceship but it was a home and the crew was a family. Without that Trinity or ensemble of characters it isn't Trek it's just Scifi with trek looking ships.",[Spoilers] St:Pic is making me like Discovery more
startrek,"* Raffi/Stephen Franklin: The trusted coworker that pushes themselves too hard and ends up falling into drug use. Has a troubled past with family.
* Rios/Susan Ivanova: Suffering military loner. Grumpy but has soft core. Has a relationship with someone who betrays the good guys.
* Jurati/Michael Garibaldi: Haunted by what they did while under the influence of psychics.
* Elnor/Marcus Cole: A fantasy character out of place in a scifi world.
* Dahj/Talia Winters: Exits their series in an event that demonstrates how evil the bad guys are. Both have hidden personalities awoken.
* Soji/Lyta Alexander: Chosen savior of their people.
* Picard/John Sheridan: Disliked and not trusted by the government they worked for. Eventually quits and forms their own group fight evil. Died and came back for our sins.
* Data/Delenn: Mcguffin. Comes from a group that all looks alike. Undergoes changes to become more human. Main protagonist is in love them.

Both series' plot involves the government acting xenophobic and selfish. Both series have a minority group trying to save themselves. Both series have an unstoppable evil that can wipe out the galaxy on the verge of being awoken. Both series have a large artificial structure that starts off as a neutral place for evil and good characters to interact. This structure is attacked multiple times and is eventually destroyed.


While a lot people feel the story line rips off Mass Effect, Babylon 5: Thirdspace involves people finding an ancient artifact that opens a portal that connects to an unstoppable evil.",Is Star Trek: Picard actually Babylon 5?

I never really got into Voyager but I imagine if I did, I’d have Arsenio Halled my fist at seeing Seven in the trailer. I loved to see Picard say Engage again. I’m watching Picard because I fucking love Captain Picard and The Next Generation, and I relish any morsels of that universe. If all they did was gather the old crew together and have them go on more missions together a la the TOS Star Trek movies, I’d have a hands-free orgasm. I mean, the show is called Star Trek: Picard.
