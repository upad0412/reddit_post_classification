0,"How come most Star Wars fans completly turn around on their opinions when a new movie come out?Before the sequels were released then the prequels were hated, every single part about those movies were picked apart and criticized. However now, they are regarded as masterpieces by the fan base.

The same applies to The Last Jedi and Rian Johnsons decisions as a director which was hated on most fronts, but since Rise of Skywalker was released the public perception has once again flipped and Rian Johnson is instead seen as a hero.",Integrity of Star Wars fans?
0,"The latest 2 episodes of the clone wars are so so good. I feel like the animation has changed and improved somehow from the other episodes in season 7, and it just makes the duel between Maul and Ahsoka look so much better. In episode 11, the brief connection to Solo - a star wars story was nice too. Also, Maul explaining and telling Ahsoka the story of how his master abandoned him makes me feel bad for him, along with how he knew how something big was going to change the galaxy for the worse and no one believed him. The episode was just so amazing and had me in awe the whole time, i cant wait for 12",I would just like to say
0,"So, to start it off i gotta tell that not just the TV-series The Clone Wars is awesome to me, but also the whole time period of the so called clone wars is just in my opinion the coolest of them all. Especially the variety of characters does it for me. I have always loved General Grievous and even though the picture of him the TV-series from 2008 gave us was not that great, i just enjoyed watching him. I was so excited when they released new episodes and i could see Grievous doing his stuff. And along with that, there were plenty other characters i really liked and wanted to see more of. And still with the ongoing season 7 i just enjoy watching it. As many other people i didnt really like the first 8 episodes, but with the beginning of the Siege of Mandalore arc they just got me. Episode 9 and 10 were awesome and hell yeah i enjoyed them. But even though these episode were awesome, there was something i was looking for but i would not be going to get. As already said in the beginning i am a huge Grievous fan and as i heard they are releasing a final season i was so excited about seeing him again. But now where we start entering the endgame i gotta realize that this little shot of him we got in episode 9 will probably be the last time i will see him on screen. And of course the fact that Grievous is not shown in the newer episodes (E9/10) does not make them less enjoyable or good (because they are pretty good). It is just a weird feeling that i am missing something that made the show for me. That made Star Wars for me. I do not know if i am the only one feeling that way but i would really like to hear your opinions about what i just described. Thanks for attention.",Why am i not able to enjoy the new episodes of The Clone Wars even though they are great? Which characters are the ones the show is about?
0,"In the bar on Kijimi there is a character called Rothgar Deng. The Star Wars site and TROS visual dictionary say this about him:

 Hanging out in the lair of the ne’er-do-wells known as the Thieves’ Quarter in Kijimi City is a bounty hunter with many cybernetic parts. An old Corellian hunter with an affinity for Imperial-era stormtrooper armor, using the alias Rothgar Deng. Like how Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba were hinted at but never mentioned outright in the *Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide*, we get hints here of someone we ought to know. But I can’t seem to place a name to this now-hideous monstrosity of low-budget-augmentation who we might have seen during the Clone Wars and chasing the *Millennium Falcon* after Hoth. Deng it! 

Does this mean that this is Dengar and that he changed his name to Rothgar Deng? It also says that he has many cybernetic parts, and i also read somewhere else that he was modified to live longer. 

Was it confirmed by Lucasfilm/Disney that this is Dengar or is this just a theory that a lot of people have?!",Was Dengar in the Rise of skywalker confirmed?
0,"At the beginning of the duel between Ahsoka and Maul, a feint Palpatine scream can be heard, like the one at the beginning of the tragedy that was the death of Kit Fisto, Mace Windu, and the rise of Darth Vader. I opened up two windows and played them simultaneous when the scream occurs and holy shit the fights mirror each other. Ahsoka makes a comment about Maul being lucky that Anakin didn't show up as the Maul/Sideous fight cuts to Anakin landing to interfere. Mace says ""[he's] going to end this, once and for all"", talking about killing Sideous, as Maul says he could destroy Sideous with Ahsoka. Maul gives Ahsoka a chance to give in and join him to kill Sideous and, by extension, save Anakin, right as Sideous asks Anakin to join him as his new apprentice and learn the dark side of the force. Ahsoka declines and Anakin says yes in sync. Maul is then captured by Rex and the detachment of the 501st with Ahsoka. As Maul is being restrained he is screaming like a fucking mainiac ""YOU'RE ALL GOING TO BURN, YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE"" as Anakin is accepting and being given his new title, Darth Vader.

If someone with editing skills could edit this together that'd be fucking awesome. I wish I could.","SPOILERS for Season 7, Episode 10. Something brilliant I found"
0,Just wanted to give an appreciation post to the animation and fluidity of the fight scenes in this episode. In the series regularly the fight scenes have been very fast and abrupt especially between force users or anyone with lightsabers. I’m very very appreciative at how the fight scenes in this episode look very lifelike and the animation seems to have that down well. It’s become less squared and blocky and much much more fluid and lifelike. Very much am liking the companion story to episode 3!,The Phantom Apprentice (no spoilers)
0,"During the clone wars, there were thousands of Jedi drawing power from the force and multiple times were the entire council was right next to palatine and got no indication he was the lord of the sith.

 Now you could argue that this is because the force was being clouded due to the war, but I believe that this was more likely due to the fact there was such a disproportionate amount of light side users to dark side users. (The force being unbalanced).

In the original trilogy and new trilogy the force seems to be a lot stronger in the Jedi and Sith who remain (force healing in 9 and Mandolorian, Ashoka being able to sense who Vader is from meeting him once, force users being able to stop blaster bolts midair, just a few examples).

Is this because there are less people drawing on the force so it is more easily manipulated?",Is the amount of force power you can use amplifier by less force users being alive?
0,"Hey guys! I’ve watched all the Star Wars movies, but I recently watched seasons 1-6 of Star Wars: The Clone Wars in order to view season 7 together with my best friend. Needless to say, I think the show is effing amazing and it’s gotten me very very interested in learning more about the Star Wars universe. I’ve heard about canon and was motivated to read the comics and novels but, and please correct me if I’m wrong, I just found out that since 2014 the “ canon” is now “legends” and no longer correlates to the “new” star wars universe/timeline? 

Does this mean the comics now have no correlation and will not be able to be in any star wars tv/movie in the future? And also what about the novels? I read that some of them are canon and others not?

0,"It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own ""canon"". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to watch most of the show and just kind of ignore the stuff with him? Or is he really integral to the show overall? I know I may be stubborn...but to me, Darth Maul is dead!

0,"I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. 

• It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.

• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. 

• You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. You are also able to kill people and take there vehicles, weapons, ammunition and gear.

• It will be open world and have multiple planets like Kessel, Coruscant, Tatooine etc.

• There would be space combat and tactical hyperspace travel having you calculate jumps on the galaxy map and needing to upgrade your hyper drive for bigger jumps. 

• There would be a deeps combat system with ranged weapons like blasters and explosions, melee weapons like vibro blades and class based ability’s like a Trandoshan’s heat vision. 

• Your ship would act as you home base where you can upgrade gear, store items and prisoners, save the game etc.

There is like a 1% chance Disney would make this because it would probably be rated M but I can hope. Anyway thoughts?",Star Wars video game idea

When the first order shows up to destroy the resistance they use a dreadnought with what looks like a slow to reload weapon.
Would it not have made sense to first destroy the rebel cruiser which is mobile and can deploy fighters against them?
Like the planets not going anywhere and there’s almost no one on it when they arrive anyway.

Also I loved the look of the rebel bombers but why make them bunch up, one of them gets taken out and the resulting explosion literally takes out another two.

If art is the representation of one’s belief, that means this has been the true meaning of Star Wars, as George has expressed his wishes for people to “be more rationale” as he describes how you must avoid the allures of riches, such was the case of his early years writing Star Wars, avoiding job offers which would have distracted him from his film goals.",The true meaning of Star Wars is

0,"Are there any good comprehensive, technical, or from an expert source on the quality difference between the 4K UHD Blu Ray Skywalker Saga boxset Vs. the Disney+ versions of these movies?

So far I've seen AVForums doing daily reviews of it, as of this post just Episodes 1-3. Assuming Episode 4 sometime tomorrow. I don't want to wait until Wednesday for the boxset to sell out before I can get a verdict if there's another good source out there on this.

0,"Feel free to disagree with me, I’d like this to be a discussion in the comments. 

When Kylo went to take off his mask in TFA, I remember my whole body tensing up. I was expecting to look into the face of the newest evil in the galaxy. But when it came off, I was slightly disappointed.

Let me say now that Adam Driver did a fantastic job, and I wouldn’t want anyone else in the role. It wasn’t his face that I had a problem with, it was the fact that there wasn’t anything wrong with his face. 

In my personal opinion, the most scary and threatening sith/dark siders had something going on with their face. I expected pale or cracked skin, maybe some tattoos, or perhaps a lack of hair or even scarring from some traumatic event. And most of all, the kicker for me, he had normal eyes, unlike every other major dark-side character, sith or otherwise. Even Dooku had yellow eyes when he wasn’t actively trying to hide his allegiance to the sith. 

This next paragraph contains SPOILERS for Episode 9: The Rise or Skywalker. 

If Kylo had yellow eyes, the scene in which he heals Rey and sacrifices himself could’ve been ten times better. Imagine him using his own life-force to heal her, his eyes returning to their normal color with his last act of purity and goodness, and upon seeing his return to his true self, Rey utters a relieved “Ben...” 

This would’ve changed everything in my opinion. What do you think?",SPOILERS: Let’s talk about Adam Driver’s face reveal in TFA.

We, as viewers, see everything a little bit faster than Ashoka does, the key card, her lightsabers, the dead clones, etc. Knowing how it ends makes it even worse because every scene you say to yourself “what if this has happened” and just get a feeling of hopeless as it all unfolds.

That's what Lucasfilm's next TV show should be, it could appeal to both Disney fans and Legends fans. The Disney fans would enjoy seeing movies like Rogue One, TFA, TROS, etc with a different spin, and the legends fans would love seeing characters like Thrawn, Corran Horn, Kyle Katarn, Dash Rendar, Mara Jade, and more on the screen, overall, if done well, this could bring both sides of the fandom together and be something truly amazing.",What the next animated series should be on Disney+

0,"So rereading legends it kind of surprised me that we really only have one book about Luke's jedi going off and doing jedi things during the New Republic era. It also surprised me just how few books in the NR era there were or how few focused on Luke. As a kid it felt like their was always another book to pick up at the store. 

But anyways it was just shocking to find out that of all the books published from the NR period forward only one really had a Jedi being assigned a mission, going out, helping people , and coming back who's name didn't end in Katarn, Horn, or Solo. We do have the Jaden Korr novels later but those are more him stumbling into a plot than being actively assigned something to do or choosing to go do something. 

Maybe it was just that with the New Jedi Order books taking up so much space and time and effort they didn't think people would be interested in those kinds of stories or would rather have those types of stories told about Jedi during the Prequel trilogy since those movies were coming out at the same time. 

That would make more sense to me than just no author having a good idea/story they wanted to tell in a time period when you could basically design your own jedi. 

The comics were the same. Their is the Leviathan comic about Luke's first class but it feels more like a extension of the Jedi Academy books than its own thing.

So Scourge is really unique in that way I suppose. Its also a pretty good book. Its plot is decent and the characters enjoyable.

0,"I love the way Hux was portrayed in the Rise of Skywalker because I can understand why JJ would no longer view Hux as competent or intimidating after being so gullible to Poe.

I think Hux was used appropriately in the Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi, although I think the conference call went on for a *little* bit too long. So if you hated Hux with the conference call, I think you should welcome that he was killed so easily because he was such a bumbling idiot during his call with Poe.

Hi all,

I’ve recently gotten into Star Wars and, after having only watched one of the prequel films previously, have now marathoned all of the films twice since quarantine started.

I can’t believe how much I’ve enjoyed it, and feel like I’ve missed out on not getting into this sooner.

Unfortunately, I found that there were a few parts of the films that I struggled to piece together (how Maul was around in Solo, for example). I’ve only seen the films, (the 3 trilogies, Rogue One &amp; Solo), so I’m wondering what you’d all recommend for me to engross myself further into the Star Wars universe. 

Somebody already told me I should watch The Mandalorian, so I’m planning to do that, but are there other series I should watch? Are there any books that you’d recommend, as I’ve been told there are a staggering amount of Star Wars books, and I’d ideally like to find the ones that cover the most detail and are canon?

I’m really open to all and any suggestions, so thanks in advance!",Best way to expand my knowledge of (canon) lore &amp; the overall Star Wars universe beyond the films.

0,"Yes i am way too late for this and I’m sure someone has already said it, but I just wanted to give an appreciation for rogue one as a whole, despite Vader’s really badass ending scene.

All of the characters in the movie were believable. None had any “special connection” to the force or any sort of magical plot device that makes them unique somehow.
Jyn Erso’s determination and her animosity for Krennic is purely derived from her father’s fate as well as carrying his torch. She was a formidable warrior, as she has been through many trials that led her to be one.

This goes the same for Cassian; he has been in the fight since a very young age, experiencing both the separatists as well as the rebellion. No doubt he has all the experience thats been shown on screen.

Not much to say for Baze and Chirrut, except that chirrut is perhaps the first force user without a lightsaber shown on screen. 

And then there’s Krennic, a man so stuck up in his ambition and pride wanting to make a name for himself within the empire. 

As for the scene where the rebellion leaders were conferring about the death star plans, when Jyn said to rely solely on hope; yet Mon mothma didn’t go “she is right we are heroes and we need to fight the bad guys for the sake of being good”, instead it was a collective decision based on how little evidence there was for the death star plans having the bug galen planted, and that led to Jyn’s crew going rogue.

They ended up attacking Scarif because they were forced to. The mon calamari, who were already determined to take down the empire in the first place made that decision for them.

So TLDR I just wanted to say how Rogue One’s story made sense as a whole without relying too much on cliche fantasy tropes. All the characters were what they are because of their efforts. There was not a single prophecy or magical plot device to make them succeed.",Appreciation for Rogue One.
0,"I'm almost 30 and have somehow managed to not see a single Star Wars movie. That is, until the coronavirus lockdown gave me time to watch them all. In a row. Over 11 consecutive days. I just finished tonight with The Rise of Skywalker.

And I was pretty upset after the credits rolled. I've heard so much division, hatred, and outcry over everything other than the original trilogy. I liked them all. I loved Rouge One and The Last Jedi. I didn't find the original trilogy to be vastly superior. I thought the prequels had great moments, and I really liked the new sequel characters.

I had avoided watching these movies because I had heard that all but three were terrible. I didn't find that to be true at all. I enjoyed 11 movies. I think it's terrible that there's so much hate. I feel bad for the people who worked hard on these movies.

 I know nostalgia plays a role in how people feel about the prequels and sequels (and I have no nostalgia for this series, since I saw them all over the past week and a half). But it was honestly shocking how much of a difference I found between people's feelings about the series and what I actually watched.","Just watched all 11 live-action movies for the first time, back-to-back-to-back.

0,"After dealing, players can do four things before the dice is rolled: Gain, Swap, Stand, Junk. 
I have the SWGE version of the game and I’m a little confused by the Gain rules. 
-Take the top card from the draw pile. You may keep the card or you may discard. If you pick the option of discarding, you must discard before you draw. 

To me this means either two things: 1) you can pick up a card and if you don’t like it you can put that card back without having to lose any of your original cards but that ends your turn. Or 2) you have to put one card in first and then pick up another card which is what the swap rule is. 
Now “Gain” means add more to your deck but you don’t add to your deck if you swap

The only Star Wars we will have for a good amount of time will be the Mandalorian, which restarts in October.

I am your father"" could be seen as appreciating that movie. But the mainstream follow up to A New Hope was the Holiday Special, one of the worst creations under the Star Wars brand. The Holiday Special proved that Star Wars didn't immediately equal good and yet, Empire overcame that. There could very well have been a terrible comic relief character or a musical number, both of which we've seen in Star Wars. Instead we got what some consider the best action movie ever.

0,"Learning from your past mistakes is great on a personal level and a really good lesson in humility, endurance, and in how to progress. But a lot of times when applied to other people or countries or ways of life it comes off as an example of what not to be. That the thing you are learning about is bad/wrong and you don't want to be like them, you may even pity them.

Which is honestly how I see the presentation of Luke in the last Jedi when it comes to using his failures as an example. Because remember when Yoda told him that it was before he force projected himself to Crait. The actions on crait, which at least start his redemption and path back to the person I was hoping to see more of, come later and while they are how a Jedi should act they aren't what Yoda is saying Rey should learn from. 

What I get from it is it saying ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and run away"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and  and attack your nephew"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and  abandon your duties and the force"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and repeat the mistakes of the old jedi order"". 

Its all ""don't be"" ""don't be"". Their is no do be in that lesson. Their is no ""Do be like Luke Skywalker and do X"" Their is no positive lesson there. Their is nothing there to make a person want to aspire to be Luke Skywalker or be like him (again their is Crait but that isn't part of Yoda's message and Rey's lesson).

When Luke is on the Island he is trying to push Rey away and gives a (very slanted) history of the order and the fall of Anakin but he offers no way to fix it. No postive change that can be done. Same when he talks about his failings as a teacher. No example of a change. No conversation about what he done right. 

""failure is the best teacher"" comes more off to me like that cartoon of the woman pointing out the homeless man to her kid and saying ""Do good in school so you don't end up like him"" 

Its all about Luke's failure and nothing about what he did right or what he learned from it and how Rey should not make the same mistakes its just ""don't be like Luke and the Jedi because they are bad"" 

Now Crait does give a good example of being Luke but again that isn't part of the message. Heck that's even more about being a message of hope to the galaxy at large not really about the Jedi Order. So it feels like at least from TLJ Luke would be used as a example of what future jedi don't want to be, a warning to students not someone to aspire to be like. 

Thankfully the VD for TROS fixed that a bit to where Rey does have his notes and journals in the Sacred Texts which means the new order will at least be using something positive he left. And he has talked to Rey more and does go more into how his image on crait helped. 

So it doesn't seem like he will be just a example of what a Jedi Shouldn't do/be. But taking TLJ by its self and that quote by its self that is really what it felt like to me. Like Luke Skywalker was a example of everything Rey and her Jedi should not be or do.","I honestly can not separate the idea of ""Failure is the best teacher"" from ""a example of what not to be"" when it comes to Luke."
0,"The lack of a scar on Rex at this point means that he has not yet taken out his chip. Additionally, in the trailer we see Ahsoka stanced up on the bridge of the cruiser and Rex on the ground. This implies that Rex receives Order 66 and fights himself out of compliance while Clones attack Ahsoka. I think Rex will beg Ahsoka to remove it for him, or even at some point beg Ahsoka to kill him (way too unlikely imo since it doesn’t seem in his character but Rex is about to go to a SUPER dark place). Thoughts? 

I also have been thinking for a while and the possibility that Ahsoka swipes along his head with a lightsaber seems possible but unlikely given her combat skill and just how dangerous it is. But, given Rex is on the ground in pain without a helmet her being caught off guard could be a time to see it. Initially I actually thought we were gonna see Rex intervene in the Maul fight and he would be hit with the Darksaber on the head. Would’ve been a nice emotional scene with Rex on the ground and Ahsoka thinking Maul just killed him. Brings emotional gravity.",Theory on Rex’s inhibitor chip
0,"Really, there's so much that could be done with those fifteen years before the end of the first season of Rebels. So much Ahsoka could have gone through and done in that time. More than enough stuff for another TV series, no?

* What did Ahsoka do for a living? How did she use her force powers, yet hide them at the same time?
* Did she try (and manage) to find surviving jedi?
* When did she start fighting the Empire? When and how did she make contact with Senator Organa? When did she become ""Fulcrum""? How did she help various rebel cells?

Note: I haven't watch the Sequel Trilogy. I am just mirroring what others have said.

First, let me put my credits in with some logical rant material. Pandering to SJWs have a part in it. Rey wasn't necessary to be added into the Trio of Terror. They also really didn't used the established plot to its advantage. They made expectations that they didn't live up to, forced us to make too many assumptions, and threw away plots that they could have easily used.

0,"I'm compulsively anti-spoiler.  To the point where I close my eyes, cover my ears and go ""lalala"" during trailers.  My friends make fun of me.

On the morning before I saw ROS  I was watching SNL Weekend Update from the night before.  The setup to one joke was about how the new Star Wars movie had the franchise's first gay kiss.  I immediately closed the video before hearing the punch line.  I was pretty pissed because I made it this far without knowing anything about the movie and this one stupid thing got through.  I mean I know its no ""Luke I am your Father"" or anything but understand I go out of my way to know NOTHING about these movies before seeing them

So I assumed the joke had to be referencing Poe and Finn since I remember reading ""speculation"" that they might be gay from somewhere at sometime.  This assumption was all but confirmed from the very first scene of the movie where they bickering like a cliche married couple.  I was kind of bummed that I already knew the big reveal sure to come at the end but whatever.

Scene after scene kept reinforcing that these two were secretly in love.  Like when Finn goes ""Rey I need to tell you something!"" as he's sinking in mud.  Clearly he was desperate confess his relationship with Poe, not wanting the secret to die with him.  And all the scenes with Poe and his ex girlfriend and how she was heartbroken yet forgiving?  Clearly Poe ended their relationship abruptly when coming out as a gay man.

Anyway, the real surprise ending for me was that these two were just bros the whole time.","I misinterpreted a ""spoiler"" and watched Rise of Skywalker assuming the entire movie was setting up Poe and Finn to be a gay couple."
0,"I'm not sure if anyone has thought of this as a mechanic, but the way we think of damage in Star Wars games from lightsaber combat is that the lightsaber strikes the combatant during battle, maybe this is stupid on my part but what about introducing a damage mechanic where the combatant doesnt actually take damage from hitting the character (like how a real Star Wars battle would be irl) but instead of a damage bar, a stamina bar that you would have to drain to get a hit which would end the battle.

Edit: additionally, some aliens are bound to serve the concept of emotion differently, or not at all.

0,"I started rebels 4 days ago with very low expectations. From what I had seen of the show it had its moments but they were very few and far between. After watching all four seasons I realize that though this was partially correct, there was much more story and lore than I originally expected and I ended up thoroughly enjoying the show. 

One of the things I loved were all of the callbacks to the Clone Wars. All the, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, references to battles and characters from the show was great. When we meet Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters, he introduces Numa. Right away I remembered her as the girl that Waxer and Boil saved in season 1 of the Clone Wars and it just made me so happy. I also can't tell you how happy I was to see Rex and Ahsoka reunite. That was something I didn't know I needed.

The lore that the show dives into is also great. It explores parts of the force that had never been seen before, but unlike The Last Jedi, it does it in a way that's built up to and not just shoved in your face out of the blue. The world between worlds and connection to the Mortis Arc in the Clone Wars was so well done.

Also, Kanan's death was easily the most heroic and emotion filled deaths I've ever seen. Allowing him to regain his sight at the last second so he could see the woman he loves and his friends one last time was absolutely heart wrenching. Thank you Dave Filoni for that amazing scene. 

My only major gripe is how incompetent the storm troopers are. They would miss nearly every shot and only land one if the plot required it. There were very few, if any cases throughout the show of any of the main characters actually getting hit. It made you feel as if they were in no danger at all unless inquisitors or someone else was there. It also made the attempts at large battles a bit underwhelming. The first one that comes to mind is Season 4 episode 14 ""A Fools Hope"". Near the end of the episode, the rebels are grouped up on a tiny platform with 7 or 8 of them behind two small boxes. They are surrounded on nearly all sides yet only one person gets hit and its only in the shoulder. I'm not saying that the scene and episode weren't entertaining, I'm just saying that there wasn't a real sense of danger. 

Overall the show starts off slow and takes a while to get going. A few of the characters are annoying to start off and the storm troopers are incompetent throughout the entire show. As it progresses everyone undergoes great character development and fulfillment. It was great to actually get to see nearly all of the character arcs get finished.

0,"So I’ve recently been trying to watch Resistance and there’s a few questions that have come up as I’m trying to get through it. So I always assumed that the First Order was created by ex-imperials but one thing that boggles my mind is why do they seem so well funded compared to the Resistance. We know that the current galactic government is the New Republic to replace the old Empire. That being said, I would imagine most member worlds of the Republic and later Empire would be part of it. Hence they should have the majority of the same resources as the Republic or Empire. But in the sequels we see them using the same ships that were being used 30 years prior, something we didn’t see as the Republic transitioned to the Empire. The Empire got all new stuff really quick. Instead it’s the First Order that’s loaded enough to have larger fleets and build Starkiller Base. The other thing that doesn’t make sense is why is the Resistance called that? Isn’t the Resistance technically the army of the New Republic? Why do they look as ragtag as the Rebellion did?

I know the easy BTS answer is that they were trying to copy the original trilogy as much as possible for the sequel trilogy (TLJ maybe being the exception) but it still doesn’t make sense that the First Order (which I suppose would be politically similar to the CIS) is massively better funded, equipped and organized than what should technically be the official army of the reigning galactic government. I kinda think of it like a Neo-Nazi group being more heavily armed and better manned than the US military. 

Am I just crazy and over thinking things?",Can someone explain something to me about the political state in the sequels?
0,"...instead of keeping the six episodes plus Clone Wars as canon, then trying to build a new, more complex and cohesive universe around their already existing plot holes, inconsistent script and acting quality, outdated themes, tropes, visuals and special effects etc.

They should have followed the MCU footsteps, by building a new canon from scratch, all the while taking as much inspiration as they needed from old movies, shows, novels and comics. Take and adapt whatever felt already well written out from previous works, but without having any actual constraints when it comes to their canon.

Completely enslaving the current canon directly to OT and PT (without the possibility of changing the overall tone, events, stories and characters from those older movies) while trying to build an open universe type of franchise which would exceed or at least rival the MCU, is a much more difficult task.

It didn't help that they unnecessarily steered clear even of many good parts of the old EU (current Legends). Most of it was utter chaos, with no Story Group or anything similar in those times. But certain works from that period are truly top of the line, and parts of their ideas and plot lines should have been implemented in mainstream movies, not just supporting shows/novels/comics, or completely left out.

Don't get me wrong, I really like and enjoy Disney SW, but at the same time I feel it barely realized 10% of its possible potential. On the other hand, Superhero themes weren't too popular before the MCU (at least not comparing to SW), so Marvel Studios had much lower starting potential for reaching legendary success. However, they basically realized all of it, while SW wasted most of what it could have been.

0,"I've been scouring the internet for the past day and a half looking for any information about whether or nor Maul/Dooku were *both* apprentices to Sidious at the same time around the time of the Phantom Menace. I'm on my second read-through of *Dooku: Jedi Lost* and with Season 7 ending, it's on my mind. 

Quick recap of the discrepancy for anyone who needs their memory jogged \[Clone Wars Season 6: Episode 10 spoilers\]: *In ""The Lost One"" it is discovered that Sifo-Dyas was killed by the Pykes over the Oba Diah moon under orders of a man named Tyranus, under the orders of Sidious. Chancellor Valorum is the one who sent Sifo-Dyas to Oba Diah, and the file on the matter was sealed, possibly by Valorum, but most likely by Palpatine/Sidious after he became Chancellor to avoid any questions. The point is, Valorum's role indicated that everything happened before The Phantom Menace, therefore before Maul had been killed.* 

Dave Filoni has said that there does *seem* to be some kind of an error with the overlap, but different posts/interviews have indicated that it may be resolved in some way, at some point. 

So my question is, which do you all think is the most likely scenario?

**Scenario 1:** Palpatine *was* breaking the Rule of Two and had both Dooku *and* Maul as apprentices at the same time - most likely for different purposes. Maul being the more appropriate Sith Apprentice and Dooku being used (the pawn as he's referred to in the Darth Vader comics) because of his ability to assist in the creation of the Clone Wars. 

**Scenario 2:** Sifo-Dyas's death most likely happened *days* within the Invasion of Naboo and Sidious/Palpatine had moved quick and already named Dooku as a new apprentice. The ordering of Sifo-Dyas's death must have been one of his first orders as a Sith. 

**Scenario 3:** Maul was Sidious's true apprentice, but Dooku was around serving as a ""sith agent"" as opposed to being an apprentice - kind of like the Inquisitorius, Ventress being a sith assassin, etc. Sidious was keeping Dooku in reserve just in case something would happen with Maul - which it did. \*\*The Pykes, in S6:Ep10, refer to Dooku as Tyranus, ***NOT*** Darth Tyranus, so this could indicate that he wasn't a Sith apprentice yet, he wasn't a Darth.\*\* So Dooku was affiliated with Sidious, but not named his apprentice yet.

It would be kind of fulfilling to have Maul say, at some point during one of the last three episodes of Season 7, ""you replaced me! while I was still alive!"" acknowledging the fact that Sidious had already moved on to replacing him while Maul was still around. But I feel like he would have already done this, in the Son of Dathomir comic or something before now. but you know, retcons happen!

Either way, what do you all think? Is there another scenario I'm missing?",Your favorite Maul/Dooku Rule of Two Theory?
0,"So, it's now been reported that Rosario Dawson is not only playing Ahsoka in The Mandalorian Season 2, but is in talks for a multiple-show deal, including a potential Ahsoka solo series. Here are two ideas for the show - particularly the main antagonists. 

So, my first idea for the main villain is a popular (currently) non-canon character that you may have heard of. His name is Galen Marek, AKA Starkiller. He was the main protagonist of the Force Unleashed duology of video games, and is a fan-favorite to this day. My idea for making him canon again is making him one of the first Inquisitors as well as Vader's secret apprentice. After the Empire falls, he seeks to accomplish what his master was trying to do: eliminate the Jedi. This would also create a cool ""apprentice vs. apprentice"" angle. 

Another idea is Barriss Offee, whom I would also make an Inquisitor. The angle I'd go for here is Ahsoka fighting one of her old friends, which is a little similar to her fighting Vader.",Two ideas for the potential Ahsoka series
0,"I had this crazy idea with my friends of an open world Star Wars game where you would choose your path(if you wanted to be a jedi or a bounty hunter) and you could travel anywhere in the galaxy. Depending on which career option you chose you would get missions which would give you credits so you can by new weapons, space craft and other items.

0,"My Reasoning, I think Rex didn’t remove His chip yet and won’t until after Order 66. We just assumes he does because of this line “I didn’t betray my Jedi, me gregor and Wolfe all removed our control chips.” remember that line. Now the way Wolfe reacts to Kanan and how Rex deals with the situation I would say 100% Wolfe removed his after.  


 In the fives arc Giraffe lady is talking to palps and he asks will the creative thinking mess with order 66. She says no, but how does she know that, and what if she’s wrong. We do know that either Grey or Styles from the Kanan Last Padawan comic overcame the chip a while after order 66, after Celeb gave a speech about Depa Billaba. So it is possible to overcome them.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now let’s go to the Bad Batch arc, one of the main plots of that arc besides Echo being alive, is Rex and his Emotions diving him and how lose and different he is from the other clones. That’s why I think we got that arc instead of The Crystal Crisis which was definitely runner up, but I also think people voted for it because we all wanted to see the padme art in HD lets be real. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rex is definitely the most advanced clone out there, maybe besides Cut or Slick but we haven’t seen them recently so we don’t really know. Rex 100% with out a doubt had the best connection with His Jedi, and with his Jedi being Anakin Skywalker not the typical jedi emotion wise, that definitely rubbed off on Rex. That is also why we got the Padme scene Instead of the art, I don’t understand why we couldn’t of had both.. But anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is all of these have been little hints toward this, and if Rex removed his chip already we would have seen it. This does work while everything if it stick‘s true to Rex‘s statement at the beginning of this post, he never said when he removed it just that he did, and since he says he never attacked his Jedi we assumed before. If he overcomes the chip and doesn‘t attack Ahsoka it fits in with the line and works.",I don’t Think Rex While Take Out His Chip Until After.

Personally, I'd love to see an open world multiplayer game set in the Imperial occupation of Mandalore where you play as a custom character and can go in different directions like becoming a member/leader of a clan or betray your people and become an agent of the Empire. But not like SWTOR where everyone's story is essentially the same thing just with a different character, rather missions that have a similar basis (kill this guy, steal this, blow this up, rescue this guy) but no cutscenes and with randomized locations so each player's story is uniquely their story. Gameplay wise it would work like Red Dead redemption with a wanted system, bounties, professions, etc.",What new material would you like to see most?
0,"I’ve seen so many comments on memes and YT vids calling out force powers and typically it’s calling out Rey’s powers and it’s getting real unfair.


Star Wars powers are simple, they’re all BS: Everytime single one is when used it’s first time but the thing is before it was Rey doing it no one complained, the first mind trick - no problem, the first force pull - no problem, choke - nope, push - nope, lightning - nope, force redirect - nope, force stop - hell nah. The only difference I can ever see here is that they were all guys and that’s it. 


The argument that no one else did it so why can she doesn’t matter, dozens of Jedi have unique abilities, Ezra Bridger has a force connection to animals, Cal Kestis has similar but he can feel the history of objects, Plo Koon could use a unique light side lightning. Every force user has the potential for unique abilities, Rey’s is healing. I do still feel that her sudden badassery in TFW is not well explained enough, it’s only in the novelisation that’s you know when she resisted Ben’s mind invasion she went into his mind and in doing so saw all his Jedi and also Sith training. Don’t say her powers don’t make sense when nobody’s powers make sense.


Sometimes you see complaints about Luke’s projection ability but that seems to get excused because he is Luke Skywalker but it’s the same situation he is just the first onscreen appearance. Also people that say Palpatine’s force storm is ridiculous, yeah it kinda is but you’re arguing that space wizards shouldn’t be able to do what wizards in fantasy can do my mixing the right crap. Some may argue well he is Luke Skywalker the biggest baddest Jedi to live with that good chosen one blood but Rey has the literal baddest blood around with the capability to ultimately turn away from the dark side that for sure pulls hard.


Star Wars is an enjoyable space Oprah, when you see a new force thing don’t get angry and heated give it a good old fashioned dad ‘cool ‘. Arguing something doesn’t make sense it a sci-fi fantasy universe where space whales can do FTL manoeuvres and a young guy can survive being struck with enough lightning to power NYC is like trying to empty a sea with a bucket, pointless and ultimately stupid.

0," I think we can all agree that neither timeline is wholly consistent. There are golden spots and there is garbage. What do you think Legends handled better than Canon? What about the opposite?

Legends over Canon:

\-The Han Solo Trilogy is far better than the Solo movie, imo. This might be an unfair comparison as they're both vastly different in aim and ambition. One tries to tell whole Han's life story, the good and the bad. The other is a fun sci-fi romp. However, I really adored Han's treatment in the novels. It showed how you could humanize a character without removing a character's mystique. We get the classic origin story ""fill in the blanks"" style storytelling, but it's done naturally. It almost felt like a sci-fi Name of the Wind. Solo makes it seem like everything important to Han Solo happened on one trip. The movie ends up feeling like a filmed wookiepedia page.

Canon over Legends:

\-This might be controversial, but I prefer Luke's ultimate fate in canon. Star Wars has always been like a modern myth. Lucas always went for mythic resonance in the PT and OT. There's nothing more mythic than the story of a hero who is initially burdened by his own legend and what it represents, a hero who comes to terms with that legend, and then finally transcends it. Luke's final scene in TLJ is one of my all time favorites. The man who uses his personal myth to inspire the rest of the galaxy, one last time. Post ROTJ Luke in Legends initially seemed like a very human figure, heroic and flawed. However, he started to feel like a RPG character after a while. Guy just got more and more OP, but grew more and more distant as a character. Any attempts at real character development (which did happen often) seemed to be temporary. There's some beautiful Luke material post ROTJ, especially in the bantam era and NJO, but I'd argue that the Luke we finally say farewell to in Crucible is the exact same individual we left in ROTJ.",What events or characters had a stronger portrayal in Canon over Legends?

0,"**A fateful night**

The vision just wouldn’t leave her mind, her son laying in darkness and vanishing at the end of her Jedi path. 

“Leia, the future is always in motion.” Luke had said those farm boy eyes filled with certainty “You can’t be sure that what you saw will happen, remember what I told about cloud city? What set my vision in motion was my own decision to leave Dagobah“. Maybe he was right, leaving Luke would start the path that would led to her vision, but that was not what she was feeling.

Now sitting alone in her quarters on Ajan Kloss she was certain of what her vision meant, but not certain of what she should do.

“Trust your feelings, Leia.” a voice came from the Force, but not Obi Wan or Yoda this was someone new and as she look to her window where the white light of the night was entering and a tall long haired Jedi was standing there a soft blue glow surrounding him, a scar marking his face, her birth father Anakin Skywalker. Luke had told her about seeing their father as Force Ghost, but she wasn’t ready. She still remembered him as Darth Vader, the monster that tortured her on the Death Star, the villain who killed so many of her friends and yet she felt nothing but warm and good feelings coming from him now.

“I am not ready for this, not now.” She said only them realizing the tears pooling in her eyes.

“I… I have something to tell you, the story of when your mo… when Padme told me she was pregnant” Anakin was nervous to talk to her, could a Force Ghost get nervous? Obi Wan and Yoda always seemed so calm. But perhaps he was measuring words because he felt what she was feeling, her fear of what he had become in life. “I was so happy, but she was always the responsible one and reminded me that she was a Senator and I was a Jedi, my commitment with the Order forbade me from having attachments, a wife, children, a family. I was born a slave and the Jedi became my freedom, but as a found love the Jedi became my prison. I found propose on being a Jedi, but I wanted nothing more than to leave the order and be a husband and a father, but I had a vision.” 

Leia heart stoped, Anakin wanted to leave the Order? She remembered the holos her father shown her from the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker was a hero to the Republic, the face of the Jedi Order for the people, ever child in the core worlds had known about Skywalker and Kenobi, before the Empire forbade any Jedi “propaganda”, but even at the height of his power as a Jedi he wanted to leave?

“I saw Padme dying in childbirth, in my overconfidence I thought only power could save her so I let myself be seduced by the dark side. I wasn’t strong enough learn a lesson from my apprentice”

“Ahsoka?“ The name escaped Leia’s lips without her knowing.

“You knew her during the Rebellion, when she was wrongly accused of bombing the Jedi temple the Jedi left her to be judged guilty by the Republic, after she cleared her name, she wasn’t angry with the Jedi, she was disappointed and she did what I couldn’t she left the only life she knew and left the Order.” His eyes where full of pride as he talked about Ahsoka. “You have that strength too Leia, if the Force and your heart are telling you to be a mother to your son, you should listen and be stronger than I was.” He held up his hand as if he wanted to touch her, tear now where rolling down her face.

“Leia, I…” 

“I know.”

Anakin smiled “I like Han, you will be happy together.” and vanished with the wind that blew from the window. 

She knew what she had to do and she knew she had the strength to do it.","After Listing to The Rise of Skywalker audiobook I felt the need to write this, I hope you all like it."

My own opinion is that even with Maul, Rex, and Ahsoka together escaping Mandalore, along with anyone that isn’t a clone or hasn’t been de-chipped, it should feel absolutely bleak. Like there’s no chance anything could ever be the same. In a sense I want it to be crushing. 

The music from RotS where the Jedi are getting taken out is rising, maybe even just above being loud where it resonates inside, they cut to similar shots from the movie or add more to it and it’s just feels like the end. And that’s when it cuts to credits end of clone wars. We don’t need to know anything more. Rebels mentions enough to form a picture and I just feel like that hopeless ending is so perfect for how it’s supposed to be. 

At the bare minimum we shouldn’t get a happy ending or one of hope.

0,"""Flying is for *droids*."" - Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, circa 19 BBY

Any hardcore Star Wars fan or hardcore prequel memer knows that Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi as a particular distaste for the piloting of starships. But why? Well, after reading *Master &amp; Apprentice* by Claudia Gray, I believe the answer has been revealed. \[Spoilers for *Master &amp; Apprentice A*head\]

*""As Qui-Gon well knew, Obi-Wan* loved *flying.""* 

Near the beginning of the story, Gray references several times Obi-Wan Kenobi's love of flying starcraft. However, this contradicts what we know about him in Episodes II &amp; III, so I was interested to see what Gray would do to change Obi-Wan's mind so drastically.

First, Obi-Wan discovers a possible replacement for flying: riding. During a scene in which he must participate in a royal hunt on the planet Pijal, Obi-Wan falls in love with riding a varactyl, which is clever foreshadowing (preshadowing? preforeshadowing?) referencing his fight with General Grievous almost 20 years later. 

However, what truly spins Obi-Wan's view is the climax of the story, in which he is residing in the cockpit of a fighter called the *Facet,* which he was completely unfamiliar with. Obi-Wan recognizes hostile droids come into the hangar, and powers up the craft and blasts them. However, he is unable to, well, turn the thing off. I'll let this excerpt speak for itself.

*""'You flew* through the ship's corridors?' *Qui-Gon put one arm around Obi-Wan's shoulders as they walked away from the corvette's docking bay. ..... Obi-Wan still appeared to be in shock. 'It was terrible,' he said, his eyes staring fixedly ahead. 'I don't want to fly again.* Ever*.'*

'*Oh, come now, Padawan.'*

0,"I personally dont think the script is all that great. Especially the whole Rey and poe kiss for no reason. It even more out of plafe than reylo. At least the story respect and carry on the last jedi storyline and give each characters an arcs. Like Fin arcs in duel of fate is honestly one of the best thing they could have given him due to becoming a defective stormtrooper. And since Phasma is alive in that script have him and phasma clash one final time big climate. Focus on story of loyalty vs doing what is right.

They could have revamp carrie fisher story or kill her offscreen and nobody would blame them due to Carrie fisher unfortunate timing death (with that being said I will give credit for JJ for trying to honor Leia death).

And Hux story was far more interesting than both TFA and TlJ

Honestly this could have estbalish this sequel as one consistent trilogy that is its own thing and not depend on the skywalker 

And I would like to remind you disney only call this the skywalker saga AFTER Rise of Skywalker trailee released. It very clear they never plan for this to be skywalker saga in the beginning. 

And the ending of Duel of Fate is just a great ending for Rey.

One of the thing that I dislike about JJ movies is that he repeated characters arcs and never have them grow. You can look at video about Patrick Willem call solving JJ mystery box and see for yourself. 

Essentially for a story that have no ending, character that end up same place before. We ses this in end of RoS.

Rey end up alone in another desert like planet literally the same place she begin when journey start. Luke at the end of journey end up with his friend and those he loved. 

In duel of fate, Rey end up in a beautiful lush green planet with other force sensitive. There is also Fin and Poe who are both her friend accompanied her. Showing she is no longet alone and she end up at different place

And George Lucas is the one who suggested to bring back Palpatine in the EU in the first place so it’s not like he hates the idea or anything. Perhaps the biggest is that it’s very strange to have six movies in your saga with him as the overall head villain and then for the next three have someone else. I don’t know it just seems so displaced from the other six in my opinion, and wouldn’t feel right considering had SUCH a big part in the previous six episodes. 

That being said, I completely despise and hate the way they actually did it in the movie. It’s obviously not planned, and they offer basically no explanation as to how he’s here now, and on top of that he doesn’t even have that much time in the movie. And the way he gets defeated is so anti climactic. He could have worked if maybe Anakin was in the movie(he should have been there anyway), and maybe he somehow lead to Palpatine getting defeated again.

The novel ""I, Jedi"" was not just a good read. It was an effective storytelling device that wove together events for a number of other books, showing them from a completely different perspective. That being a character who was far more essential to those events than we had realized. 

Same could be done with Ahsoka. There are myriad reasons we may not have seen her during the OT and sequel trilogies. Did she distract the rest of the bounty hunters in ESB so our heroes only had to deal with Fett? Perhaps she assisted the Bothan spies in stealing the plans for the second Death Star. Why didn't we see more of the Knights of Ren? Was Ahsoka responsible, keeping them occupied and at bay so they couldn't come at Rey and Co? Did she Obi Wan in his adventures, or have him help her on a mission or two...?

0,"TRoS is a controversial film that has drawn a lot of criticism from the Star Wars fanbase. While I personally enjoyed the film, I'm not making this post to defend it in it's entirety. Rather, there is one criticism that is often repeated, which I intend to refute:

**Palpatine being alive cheapens, lessens, or entirely negates Anakin sacrificing himself to destroy him.**

Though, admittedly, the film makes no effort to support these arguments explicitly, there are two reasons why that criticism is inaccurate, and why Palplatine being alive has either a neutral or positive effect on Anakin's sacrifice:

**1.** **The point of Anakin's sacrifice wasn't to kill the Emperor; it was to save Luke**

Vader's last act in RotJ accomplishes two things; it kills the Emperor, and it saves Luke. Palpatine surviving in TRoS means he only accomplished the latter. This has upset people, as they see it weakening the point of his sacrifice. But why does it matter if Palpatine is permanently dead? Why is Anakin's great act of redemption contingent upon killing the Emperor? Remember, Vader wanted to kill him as far back as ESB. In true Sith fashion, he wanted to kill his master and turn Luke to the dark side as his new apprentice. Look at it like this:

**What Vader wanted in ESB**: Kill Palpatine, turn Luke to the dark side, live forever

**What Anakin accomplished in his RotJ redemption**: Kill Palpatine, save Luke after embracing the light side, and die

In both scenarios, he kills Palpatine, but what changes is the *why.* Rather than killing him to overthrow him and take his place, he kills him to save his son at the cost of his own life. It's the *why* that shows Anakin's redemption. The Jedi returned, he sacrificed his own life to save the life of an innocent. If he was motivated by the goal of *killing* Palpatine, there is no growth or redemption. If he was motivated by *stopping* Palpatine from torturing and killing his son, and motivated so much so that his own life is willingly given in the process, then there is growth and redemption. He redeemed himself by acting like a Jedi, not a Sith

**2. The chosen one prophecy was bullshit**

This is a shorter point, and it's simply that the whole ""chosen one, bring balance to the Force, etc."" prophecy was always bullshit. ""A prophecy misread could have been"" or whatever Yoda said sums it up. There are so many ways to interpret it that it's essentially meaningless. The Jedi held onto it as an idea to feel like they still knew what was going to happen, to still feel like they understood the Force. But the whole point of the prequels was that the Jedi were so up their asses that they didn't notice their elected leader was a fucking Sith lord. Their powers had weakened. They were so obsessed with their own dogma that they never even questioned Anakin being immaculately conceived. A Sith Lord created a perfect dark apprentice literally out of thin air, and the Jedi are just like ""chosen one, bring balance to the Force."" Yeah, they don't want to train him at first, but because of their age restrictions, not because of common sense. 

All this is to say that the Jedi reliance on a vague and meaningless prophecy was bullshit and expecting Anakin to literally bring balance to the Force (whatever that means) detracts from the actual human element of his sacrifice.

0,"During the quarantine, I've been showing my fiance a lot of movies I enjoy. We watched most of the Marvel movies over the last three weeks and now we are doing Star Wars. After watching The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones all the way through for the first time in a few years... woof. Those two are just... okay. I don't hate them, but I didn't love it. Revenge of the Sith is so good even in comparison to the rest of the Star Wars movies, but the first two in the prequels just aren't that good. Half the time, I had to explain to my fiance the importance of the politics in the movies. Being a Star Wars fan for most of my life, I know what's going on and have done so much research and watched a million youtube videos about Star Wars, so for me it all made sense. But for her, as someone who has only seen the sequels, the politics and back story of what is going on was not clear to her. I think back as a kid I really had no idea either, I just enjoyed the spectacle of all the effects and action. 

All that being said, I have gained a new respect for the sequels. While I was able to enjoy The Rise of Skywalker, even after a few viewings, I found it hard to enjoy The Phantom Menace, aside from the Pod Racing and the Maul duel. Same applies for Attack of the Clones, easier to watch than TPM, but still just tough at times. My fiance has seen the sequels, but she wanted to watch the other 6 because she wanted to see them all. She commented to me that no one should ever say the sequels are bad after watching the gungan army versus the droid army in TPM. I couldn't disagree with her. I love the prequels and love that era, but the movies are a tough watch if you're not a fully invested fan. The only movie she said she enjoyed from the prequels was Revenge of the Sith, which is totally fair. The re watch has just shown me that maybe we should give Disney more credit than we do. Though there are major gripes with the sequels, they're at least pretty good movies. Overall, I'd say the sequels are better, but of all the 6 prequel/sequel movies, Revenge of the Sith is the superior movie. 

Sorry for being so long winded, but after my first re watch in a few years of the Prequels, I had to let my pride go and recognize that Disney is on the right path, it might have just taken a few sputters to get in the right direction.",The Prequels (a rewatch with someone who's never seen them)
0,"If you remember the Mortis arc in TCW season 3, the Father represented the force, the Daughter represented the light side and the Son represented the dark side. The father brought the chosen one (Anakin) to bring balance because the son was getting too powerful and planned to leave Mortis. While they were there, all three Mortis gods died. First the daughter, then the son and finally the father. When Anakin left, the force was balanced because all three Mortis force-gods were dead and none of them could grow too powerful and leave Mortis to wreak havoc on the rest of the galaxy.

Therefore, Anakin was the chosen one after all even though Palpy apparently survived RotJ, because the prophecy was never ABOUT destroying the Sith. The Jedi in all of their ignorance twisted it to be about that. In reality, according to my friend who came up with this, the prophecy was ACTUALLY about destroying the Mortis gods and preventing them from escaping the way the Son was trying to do.",New theory on the chosen one prophecy my friend came up with:
0,"I believe that the Karen Traviss 'Republic Commando' novels and ""Imperial Commandos' novel are the best at describing Mando life that I have seen as of yet.  I like how she puts together the whole training of the clone commandos by the Mandalorian comrades of Jango Fett.  The way the commandos interact with one another and their language interplay is amazing.  I, also, like how the Arc Troopers are from Kal Skirata's parentage.  You can see so many differences in each of the clones and how they adapt their Mando trained culture into everyday life.  

Does anyone have any other books that treat Mandalorian culture the same, or go into greater depth?",Karen Traviss novels and Mando culture
0,"I've been watching some stuff about DID and I wonder if that's what happened with Vader.  
DID is triggered by heavy trauma. To sum it up, it happens when the trauma is way too strong for the victim to actually deal with it. Accompanied with extreme stress and emotional inarticulation, (which are both induced by his Jedi training,ironically enough) it may lead to complete conscious dissociation.  
2 things lead me to this hypothesis : clues in the story and the way Vader's personality mirrors Anakin's.  
My clues are in Rebels,during his encounter/fight with Ahsoka and in Return of the Jedi,when Luke verbally confronts Vader.  
In Rebels, when Ahsoka appears before him, he doesn't talk to her as if he ever knew her,rather as if he knows of her from somebody else's memories. He also constantly refers to Anakin as another person and claimed that he destroyed him since he was weak.  
But the most direct clue,to me, is right after Vader took Ahsoka's blow to his mask.  
Not only does he call her by her first name, but responds (physically at least) to being called Anakin. He then looks down in shame,and then Vader takes over.  


In ROTJ, not only can Luke sense the conflict inside of his father,but the audience also can. I think this whole scene is Anakin being himself.He reacts to his on name in almost a childish way,very much like he could have done in AOTC. ""You don't know the power of the Dark Side"" is a warning. Not only does it sound like one,but it's also indicated by the context. The way he handles Luke's lightsaber and comments on it is a sign of how proud of his son he is and obviously,the line ""it is too late for me,son"" speaks for itself.We can also argue that ""Son"" used this way sounds rather affectionate,especially coming from the OG ""not the men,but the women and children too"" youngling killer . And only on Luke's second discussion with him,mind you.  


But most importantly, why do I identify Vader as an alter ?  
I think that Vader is Anakin's psyche's response to his own utter failure. He's responsible for the destruction of the Republic, lost all of his friends, got heavily mutilated by his former mentor,ended up being pretty much Palpatine's slave, and he didn't even reach the goal he was trying to attain by doing all of that : Saving Padme. All he has is his anger,his hate,and the Dark Side.  
Where Anakin was emotionally eruptive, Vader is composed.  
Where Anakin was sometimes impulsive and spontaneous, Vader is incredibly calculating.  
Where Anakin lacked repartee, Vader is, like, the sassiest guy in the galaxy,just look at his punchlines.  
Where Anakin believed in defending the weak, Vader claims he destroyed Anakin because he was weak.

So,what do you guys think ?",[DISCUSSION] Did Anakin suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder ?
0,"As we all know, despite the disappointment of the sequel trilogy and the mediocrity of the prequels, the star wars universe has still captured our imaginations. So I pose a question. Why do you, people of reddit, think the original trilogy succeeded while the other trilogies did not? By success, I am referring to rating, fan love, or the general opinion of the trilogy. NOT the profit. The original trilogy is seen as this amazing story that is highly rated and it popularized the name ""star wars"" while the other 2 trilogies are seen as not even half of what the original was. So why do you think it succeeded? because of George Lucas, the time period, the story, etc. I personally believed the original trilogy succeeded because George Lucas wrote it as one movie instead of 3 (then he changed it to 3 because it was way too damn long), as said in the documentary ""Empire of dreams."" I am excited to hear what everybody else has to say as to why the original is so much better than the rest. (NOTE: we are not here to debate why a certain trilogy sucks or not. I don't want the comments of this post to be a long, drawn-out debate. Just why the trilogy succeeded or why do you believe it didn't sit well in the eyes of the fan base).",Why is the original trilogy seen as the best while the other 2 (generally) didn't live up to fan's expectations as they had hoped?
0,"... if you consider TROS needed saving.  Honestly, I enjoyed it.  Yes, there are a lot of plot issues, but...

There are like 3000 hours of youtube contents on those already, and I am 1/10000 as eloquent as they are, so you can go ahead and watch those videos instead.

But rather, I was just thinking, if there's one thing I really didn't like about the ending, it's how it felt rushed... almost like... well, Rey killed Palapatine, nothing left to do, so... so off screen action... and millions of abducted children are now dead.  Thanks Obama.

But that weird LOTR Ghost Save moment could have been saved, had they simply kept Hux alive.

Think about the issues that could have been resolved:

1: And I know this is a huge one; ships can't fly up.  Well, as it turns out, the fleet is in huge disarray because of a saboteur... Hux!  

2: Imperial star destroyers aren't just being LOTR Ghosted, they can actually put up a good fight (enhance story tension), but it's with Hux and his new found conscience to freed the imprisoned mind of abducted children, half of the final order ships defected and won the final battle.

3. Hux get to have his redemption quirky one-liner moment for whatever he could say for finally ruining Kylo's plan.  (Which I kinda felt like the film was moving toward until Pryde killed him for no reason)

4. Continuing off of point 2, you give a lot of weight to the abducted children issue.  Cause right now, it's like... no empathy for killing millions of abducted children.  So keeping Hux as a conduit for redeeming a lot of these kids seems to me like a lot more meaningful then simply killing them all.  I mean, the trilogy kept trying to push the theme of ""awakening"" and how Lando's hypothetical children can turn back from being brainwashed.  So it's actually very uncomfortable to think that none of those million of other kids are redeemable, what if a lot more of them can wake up too?

It's just kind of my view how at least some of the complaints people have with TROS can be resolved with simply keeping Hux alive.  (At the very least, a little longer... like, not dead until final battle kind of thing)  I do understand however, that you don't want to credit too much of the rebel success to a former villain.  I kinda feel there's still ways to execute it so that even if that's really what's going on in the background, cinematically, you still give more weight to rebels with more screen time, like the movie in its current state now.  What do you guys think?",Hux's death is a waste and could have saved TROS
0,"In my opinion, with no death threats wanted. I believe Disney saved Star Wars. I love ROTS, but I think George Lucas did not have interest in Episodes 1 and 2, he just wanted ROTS to be made. Which did work out for that movie. But the sequel trilogy has been very good in my opinion. (Nothing like the originals of course.) 7 is great, 8 is probably the most okay you can get, and I really loved 9.

0,"The next lightsaber duel we get to see will be between characters we’ve never seen or heard of. Unless it’s one between Ahsoka and Moff Gideon but I doubt the mandalorian will go there in season 2. (Rosario Dawson’s Ahsoka is only being cast as a guest star so I would not get your hopes up bc she will probably show up at the very end of season 2 the same way the dark saber was revealed)

The rebels sequel may have lightsaber duels but from the rumors it won’t be light VS dark. 

It’s so crazy that we may not see another red lightsaber vs. green, blue white etc. ...maybe ever. 

The ending of clone wars is prolly gonna be the best payoff Star Wars fans have ever got. The shame of it is the Ahsoka arc and how it wasn’t exactly great. It’s a shame bc of quarantine, the show prolly got extra viewers but that Ahsoka arc didn’t exactly hook anyone, as far as I’m concerned. 

It sucks bc the really good clone wars episodes that focus on the actual war have been amazing since about halfway through season 3 (with the mon Cari - water world arc being an exception bc it sucked lol)

I don’t know why or what they were thinking with some of these silly filler episodes. The siege of mandalore could have easily been 12 episodes with every episode ending on a cliffhanger and viewers would have come running, imo.",After the duel between Ahsoka and Maul we may not see another lightsaber duel for 24-36 mos or longer.
0,So Disney + recently got released in my country and I watched the show thoroughly except the last season which I will get around watching later. What I noticed is that isn't he supposed to be the master of Soresu and have impenetrable defence? Except the Maul and undercover bounty hunter arc he seemed quite useless because the other jedi did have cool fighting sequences and would get shit done. He keeps getting beat up by non force users and force users alike. Him getting beaten up by Dooku is fine as he is a smart motherfucker likr Obi Wan himself but why isn't he able to outsmart normal adversaries?,Why is Obi Wan so weak in the Clone Wars show?
0,"No spoilers but man that filler arc really sucked. I had heard everyone complaining about it but I figured it wouldn’t be that bad. Idk why Disney would give us this arc or those terrible characters it almost hilariously makes zero sense especially considering there was so many other cool and interesting storylines to explore. 

Hell I would’ve preferred a filler arc that further explored Ashoka and Lux Bonteri’s relationship. That would’ve been so cool then working together while she’s outside the jedi order. And they already have history. Even if you’re not a romance fan that was juicy shit when she actually developed feelings for him and Anakin said he understood how she felt. 

Almost anything would’ve been better than what they gave us. This stings worse than the prequels because we pretty much expected those to be bad but not this... anyway the latest episode was truly amazing so there’s that.",Late to the party.

Good job guys, good job, but there is only one main problem. The movie is not ""original"". Like all the sequels, there is nothing new added to the circus. Speeder chasing, a training course, the decision to leave training while not ready, the temptation of the dark side, the final epic battle where Palpatine laugh in the face of the poor jedi alone who must surrender to the dark side, a travel inside a star destroyer that \*looks exactly like a death star interior\*, a sand planet, the mad return to the remote island of the gone master (this was sick), the vision of the ghost master that fix the poor jedi.

And after all of this, after episode 4 remake, after that trash randomly ordinated episode 5 remake, after a Marvelish like useless ending with a lot of sparks but zero emotions, all this good people ripped off one of the greatest ending in all movies, the two suns of Tatooine of Episode 3.

2 They didnt want George Lucas.  


3 They wanted to make money, so they copied what George Lucas did, 40 years ago, in hope to make another masterwork. They made money, the did a work, not a masterwork. 

4 I felt more emotions in the opening of episode 7 (Finn, the landing and kylo Ren) than the ending of episode 9 (wich is random events until the goods win)   


5 I've seen Lost by JJ Abrams, it's far more original than this movies. You had your chance pal, maybe you did a lot of money, but i loved you for being a pioneer, not a copycat.

0,"I’ve always been under the impression that ROTS takes place over the course of at least 4 months. When Palme tells Anakin she is pregnant, there is hardly a bump. Throughout the movie, she gradually gets larger and larger. Anakin’s turn obviously truly started with the death of his mother, and then rapidly progressed from the start of ROTS, with the premonitions of Padme’s death. Everything that happens after that just catalyzes his turn. It seems unlikely that he totally turns over the course of just a couple days or even hours. It’s hard to tell that the movie takes place over that span of several months though, because you’re constantly jumping between planets, all at different times of day &amp; night. I feel the same about Ep.II. I think Anakin and Padme has several weeks to a month to fall in love on Naboo. He obv. felt strongly about her since Ep.

0,"The light side wins in every movie. Right there off the bat you’re fundamentally misunderstanding the franchise. In the first 6 movies the light side wins on some occasions and the darkside wins on other. That’s what makes both of those wins meaningful. If one wins every time it’s meaningless just like it is in the sequels. There are no stakes. You never buy the first order are actually a big deal, no matter how much you fabricate it you cannot earn evil greatness without them actually succeeding on occasion. Kylo Ren had so much potential, Adam driver an amazing actor did SO MUCH with what he was given but he can only do so much to be a supervillain, the script has to support him. Rey BEATING HIM in the forest when he’s basically fully trained and she’s NOT EVEN TRAINED AT ALL, NOT TRAINED, NOT TRAINED. This is one of the biggest insults in the entire franchise because you play up a character with smoke and mirrors (make him look and sound like a badass powerful villain) but then completely destroy that character when it’s time for actions. He loses when she’s untrained but then is better than her in rise of the skywalker when she is. The sequels would have made much more sense if he beats her in the forest, the badass moment of him killing Han Solo isn’t taken away, HE WINS at the end of the force awakens. Then she goes training. And THEN her win would have been so much sweeter.

This all stems from the same problem the end of Game of thrones had. Hollywood is afraid to let the bad guy win sometimes, they think the heroes need plot armor all the time but they don’t, they think they can’t go through trials and tribulations but they NEED to. There has to be stakes, there has to be real losses to make the wins real.",The biggest problem with the sequels
0,"I didn’t finish reading the Ahsoka novel, but this has been bugging me.

Togrutas are carnivores, but Ahsoka manages to eat the rations that Kaeden gave her on Raada.

Raada is a hugely agricultural planet, and according to the book: They make their own rations, they have lots of farms, and Ahsoka notices while “hiking” that there aren’t a lot of animals worth hunting for meat. 

Kaeden gave her rations as a reward for fixing her thresher, and Ahsoka even says that it could last her a month or more (implying all of them were possible for Ahsoka to eat) and that food was no problem on that planet because they made everything themselves. 


There are questions of mine regarding this interaction:

Ahsoka notices meat isn’t in big supply on the planet, but that is the only type of thing she can really eat (it is specifically said on wookipedia that togrutas are carnivores not omnivores). How would there be abundant meat-based rations? 
- I am not saying there are NO meat rations, but it cant be in abundant supply for a carnivore on a planet that is mainly only known for plant based agriculture. 

Even then, how’d Kaeden know to bring only meat based rations, or know Togrutas are carnivores (since she was just a farmer, and Togrutas were very tribal and discouraged individuality [they werent wanderers])? 
Ahsoka and her barely had any interactions prior to bringing the rations, so I doubt Ahsoka told her, and I doubt Kaeden even had known many Togrutas before (to know if they were carnivores).

My main point is meat isn’t as common as plant-based food there, so Kaeden would have had to cater specifically to her, but it would be unlikely she even knew Ahsoka’s diet.

It is very nit-picky, I know. I was just curious.

0,"Since Mando S1 has been over for a few months, I wanted to look back at it and get some of your opinions on the season as a whole. Understanding what the show is now, how did you feel about the first 3 episodes being plot-driven, the middle three being more episodic in nature, where Mando does random odd-jobs around the galaxy, and finally the last two episodes returning to the initial plot that was set up in the first three episodes? 

(I personally think they weren’t for no reason. I believe it’s very very possible each story told within those episodes could bring future complications for the Mando again. *looking at you, shady man *COUGH BOBA FETT* cough in boots at the end of episode....5 or 6, I forget). 

Do you think those episodes were a waste of time? Do you wish episodes that furthered the main plot line replaced those middle three stories? Basically would you have preferred 8 plot-driven episodes?

At the time of their releases, I enjoyed seeing Mando going about the galaxy doing whatever he wanted, but I did thirst for more of the main story involving Baby Yoda, but now I’m glad Lucasfilm/Favreau and Filoni did what they did. I have 10000% trust in those two men.  

I guess polls aren’t allowed on this sub so start your reply off with one of these three options:

1. Yes! I liked it. It’s nice to see what’s going on in the galaxy and get a view of day-to-day life for not just the mando, but bounty hunters and your everyday-characters as well.

0,"First of all, I loved the force unleashed games, I played both of them a lot and was a big fan of how quite frankly badass they made you feel. That being said, looking back, I can't help but look back and think that starkiller is a lot less interesting of a character than the fandom makes him out to be. The only things about him that I can see as interesting are 1) his level of power and the feats this enables him to achieve (yes him bringing down a star destroyer has become a meme at this point!) and 2) the conflict of his character.

With point one, I really don't know how you'd implement him back into canon in a way that is justified within the story it's being told in. I've heard the suggestion of making him an inquisitor, however we know in canon that they are trained in a way so that their levels of power are limited, to keep them in check with Vader, so this wouldn't hold up. Furthermore, the reason this power is interesting in TFU is because you get to control it, sure watching it on screen would be cool, but it wouldn't come with any sort of depth. 

Now onto my second point, I don't think Starkiller is a completely disinteresting character, but at the very least, all the ways in which his character are interesting have already been done in canon, and a lot better than that. Examples of this would be Kylo Ren and his struggle with the light and dark that was portrayed beautifully by Adam Driver. My point being that I think he'd end up feeling like an amalgamation of other canon characters.

As much as I enjoy(ed) TFU games, I don't think Starkiller has a place in canon, least not this late after so much as been re established so differently.",Unpopular opinion but I don't think Starkiller should be re-canonized.

0,"For those who have seen the prequels when they were released and disliked them – how do you feel about them after all these years? If you like them more now, do you think it'll be the same with the sequels? 

Why I ask: I was too young when the prequels were first released, but they've really grown on me over the years. Actually I don't know if I disliked them at any time. Of course I realise they're flawed, I think it doesn't have to be explained what's wrong with them, but I was just asking myself if I like them so much more compared to the sequels because of nostalgia, or because I like the idea that it's still the original vision of George Lucas... That's why I want to hear opinions from people who disliked the prequels when they first came out and who have since changed their minds.",How do you think the sequels will age compared to the prequels?
0,"In The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine's ultimate goal is for Rey to kill him so that he can transfer his spirit into her.

However, one implication of this scene is that it retcons Palpatine and Luke's interactions in Return of the Jedi. During the throne room scene, Palpatine goads Luke into killing him. Up until TRoS, it has been generally understood that this is Palpatine's attempt to sway Luke to the dark side. After TRoS, we now know that Palpatine's PRIMARY goal in this scene must actually have been to transfer his spirit into Luke, just as he did with Rey.

Why do we know this to be true? New canon material (TRoS Expanded Edition) establishes that, when Vader threw him over the ledge, he used the same knowledge he attempts to use on Rey in TRoS to transfer his spirit from his falling body to a clone of himself on Exegol. This information tell us that he already had the knowledge to take over Luke's body by the time of Episode VI, and given the age of his current body, he definitely had the same intention to take over the body of someone far younger and more powerful. It fails on Luke, and fails again on Rey - a symbolic symmetry that JJ was clearly aiming to achieve.

This change is important and one that I feel damages the original scene in Episode VI. **The intent of the original scene was to highlight Luke's character and commitment to the Jedi principles.** Despite the mastermind behind all of the terrible galactic events sitting unarmed in front of him, he resists the urge to act out of hate and slay the Emperor. This resistance is exactly the principle that Yoda teaches him the movie before, where Luke learns that ""Jedi use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.""

Palpatine knows this and tells Luke to kill him. In the pre-TRoS universe, he's not doing this because he's suicidal. He's doing this because he knows that anyone who sees the Emperor would be vulnerable to falling to their own hatred, and in that vulnerability rises weakness. Palpatine knows that hatred is the ultimate counter to the Jedi principles Yoda must have taught him, so he exploits Luke's natural hatred towards him by taunting and goading him.

The risk in this scene, therefore, is symbolic. If Luke kills the Emperor, he is no better than the Sith. Killing Sidious right there would end the war, but the method clashes with the ideals of both the Rebel alliance and the fallen Jedi Order they revere. Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor - embodied by the quote ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me"" - is **monumental because most people, including us in the audience, would have abandoned their morals and principles to get that cheap kill.** And that's why Luke is a Jedi, while most people aren't.

Come TRoS, and now we know that the risk Luke is facing is no longer symbolic and of character, but rather an existential risk. If Luke kills the Emperor, he would literally die and have his corpse taken over by the Emperor. Existential risks can make for good storytelling too, but in this case it seriously degrades the significance of the original scene. Now Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor is one motivated by pure survival instincts - not by a delicate adherence to Jedi principles. Tell Han Solo that blasting the Emperor would mean he dies and OF COURSE Han would put his blaster away. Luke's decision is no longer a show of unique character, but rather a decision that even you and I, as non-Jedi, would've made in that situation.

This is why the Emperor laughs when Luke finally does strike and is blocked by Vader. It means his goal of instilling hatred in Luke is succeeding. Given TRoS, Palpatine should've yelled ""Vader you ruined my plan of spirit transfer!"" instead of laughing.

The only solution I see to this thematic retcon is that Luke, while making his decision in Episode VI, isn't aware of the Emperor's spirit transfer and is thus still making his choice based on character rather than survival instinct. While this reduces the damage to the uniqueness of his character, it still damages the scene because strips it of some of the stakes. We as the audience now understand that there is no reward for killing the Emperor. Until Vader betrayed him, the Emperor would have won if Luke attacked and still would have won if Luke spared him. It's a lose-lose situation either way.

Luke's decision in the pre-retcon version of the scene was significant because he was presented with a win-lose situation, where killing the Emperor would have meant a quick victory for the rebels, and yet still chose the losing outcome that came at a cost to his own safety at the hands of the Emperor's lightning.",Thematic Retcon in The Rise of Skywalker that reduces the symbolic significance of the Original Trilogy
0,"I've seen people arguing over the prequels, the Sequels, Rebels, Resistance, and Battlefront. But what none of you realize is that none of you are true Star Wars fans. 

True Star Wars fans hate the Prequels for bad dialogue and CGI, the Originals for Ewoks, the Sequels because Disney bought them and ruined your childhood. True Star Wars fans don't watch kiddie crap like Clone Wars, Rebels, or Resistance. They don't play non-EU games like Battlefront or Fallen Order. They don't read the Disney SJW comics like Dr. Aphra - or the ripoff books like Zahn's new Thrawn trilogy.

0,"*While I feel that I am absolutely not alone in this, it is my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.*

Ahsoka is arguably (if not absolutely) the greatest embodiment of a strong female character in the entirety of the Star Wars franchise. This primarily stems from the fact that we've seen her journey from a naive, headstrong Padawan that frequently got herself into trouble with her youth and inexperience to the nearly-unanimously loved character that still isn't perfect, but is strong - both in her combat skills and her cunning intellect - in spite of her imperfections. Indeed, it's the fact that she's imperfect and still makes mistakes that makes her so relatable and widely loved.

As a ""man's man,"" of sorts, and an avid fan of the franchise (maintained thanks to this season of Clone Wars and the Mandalorian series), I can say, proudly and without a sliver of doubt, that Ahsoka is one of my favorite characters in the entire franchise. 

Characters like Ahsoka, Bo-Katan, and Cara Dune are strong, badass female characters because we've either seen their journey to that point, or they simply are without trying to be. If Dave Filoni has the reigns for any future Star Wars movies, I see no shortage of naturally compelling, strong, and widely loved female characters. 

*To Dave Filoni and his colleagues: **Thank you for all your hard work on the incredible stories and beloved characters that have expanded the Star Wars universe more than we ever imagined. The force will undoubtedly be with you. Always.**","Star Wars needs more Ahsoka Tanos, Bo-Katans, and Cara Dunes."

0,"I would love to see a movie about the Empire, like one from the point of view from. Stormtrooper during the age of the rebellion. There are two sides to every story, and we only get to see one in the movies. There are some comics out there that kind of cover this, but not in a big scope like a movie could. I would love to see a stand alone, but maybe even a trilogy about it. 

Movie #1: Rise of the Empire
We are on a very poor planet, maybe Corellia? We meet a young man, 19 or 20 and he lives in a poor family. His father is a ship builder, working on imperial ships. From a you g age he has always been impressed with these ships. His family struggles to survive because of the gangs that ravage the area of the plant he lives on. The gang attacks the Imperial ship yard one day and kills his father, so the empire strike back at them and destroys this gang. He looks up to the Empire after this and enlists in the Imperial Army and we follow him though this journey in the first film.

Movie #2: Glory Days
This is set 10 years later. After proving himself a more than capable solider he is promoted to the Stormtrooper corps. We see him fight along side his fellow troopers in small battles putting down insurrection across the galaxy, small band of rebels are starting to pop up. We can see the good in the Empire here, how they had good intentions, just not always see through in the best way. He starts a family of his own, only to see it destroyed when a rebel cell attacks the Imperial base he is stationed on.

Movie #3: Empires End
This movie starts only 2 years before ROTJ. Our main character is not a commanding officer in the Imperial Navy. We see conflict in him as he has seen the extreme tactics used by the empire ( The usage of the first Death Star) but he still believes in the core value of the Empire and he believes that it is the best form of stability for the Galaxy. He is now a grizzled veteran and has seen a lot. Being the experienced soilder he is the High command decides to place his unit in charge of the defense of the defense of the Second Death Star. He personally oversees the troopers positioned on the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. His position is overrun by Han and the rebel forces, but he survives the battle, only to be executed in the end for the “evil acts” he committed against the galaxy, when is reality, he was only doing what he felt was right in the galaxy

To see this tragic hero’s journey from the other side of things I think would be very interesting. There were people in the galaxy that thought the Empire was good, and up until the final years of its rein, it was for all intensive proposes was good. On top of that maybe we would be able to see a storm trooper hit its target for once!",Empie Movie
0,"The other day I saw a 34 minute long video on youtube which summarised the Skywalker saga with footage and audio from all the movies. It started with the Phantom Menace and finished up with RSW. It was very emotional, an amazing build up. But when we reached The Force Awakens, I noticed that the build up was broken. There was no build up anymore, The Force Awakens seemed to be a completely unrelated episode since it just started with Rey sitting in the sand doing basically nothing. 

I understood that the sequel trilogy is not really part of the Skywalker saga. It just takes some elements and characters from that saga and makes up a completely new story and saga. The Skywalker saga finishes with The Return of the Jedi, Anakin fulfils the prophecy and Luke becomes the hero he will always be. The sequel trilogy is just a different story. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that perspective in mind, I learned to appreciate the sequel trilogy, because it does not bother me how they destroy some characters like Luke, or how they introduce inconsistencies on the universe, like using light speed to destroy other ships. Or why Rey is so skilful and powerful without training, while Luke needed more training. To me these are not inconsistencies since the sequel trilogy simply is not a sequel to the other movies. I can sit back and enjoy the sequel trilogy now and see them as entertaining movies with great visual effects and some nice characters (I actually like Rey's personality). That being said, these are fun movies, mostly made for kids and not necessarily something I would be very enthusiastic about. I like them, but I don't love them like I love the REAL Skywalker saga.",Learning to appreciate the sequels

One for each movie of course. The set up is as follows, After the death of Emperor Palpatine, Imperial figures fight over the rightful ""throne"" to the empire, creating an internal war inside the empire. Soon, the empire breaks off into hundreds of Imperial factions with different leaders. The Jedi suffer a similar fate, as luke skywalker and several other Jedi decide to abandon the ways of ""Jedi"" and ""Sith"" and create a community where people are allowed to interpret the force in their own ways. Soon conflict breaks out between the remaining pure Jedi, and the free-thinking Jedi. Kylo Ren, a leader of an Imperial Faction, creates a political movement calling for the reforming of the imperial government, more specifically calling for the factions to come together to form the empire that once was. His belief is that since economic resources are spread so thin across the factions, there will be no way to defeat the Jedi. Unless they all come together. Kylos movement gains a following, and soon the empire comes together at last with a stronger desire to take down the Jedi than ever before under their new Extremist Leader, Kylo Ren. Now, Luke Skywalker and his group of free-thinking Jedi have to come to terms with the pure Jedi to stop the empire once again.",Fan-made Star Wars Trilogy

0,"I can't remember a time when I have not loved Star Wars. My earliest days of loading on Episode Two at the start of the arena and watch to the end. Playing Battlefront 2 so many times that I went elite in most of the classes. So upset with my dad for not letting me see Episode Three in theaters because I wasn't thirteen yet. When the 2d animated show ran for three minutes on Friday I could never wait for next week's taste. When I finally was able to appreciate the whole series from start to finish, even if the prequels were not as good as I remebered. When the 3d show was announced and my excitement started all over again. I remember when Disney bought Lucasfilm and the worse part was the Clome Wars was cancelled. But I defended it, anyone who did not believe in the new future was just stuck in the past. 



They had Marvel under their belt, a catalog of heroes and villians that was slowly all building together to what would be an unforgettable end. I thought this is what was in store for my beloved Star Wars. And TFA I saw in the theater and I was let down. The death of the EU was disappointing. But this was just a hiccup, a mistep, they would recover and the next two would be the story of the OT with the spectacle of PT. But TLJ was nothing but confusing and conflicting. Careful lore and a built up world was tossed aside. I won't go into the details but the things wrong were far too many. I did not even watch RoS after what I heard.



I had nearly given up on my once beloved series when the Clone Wars last season would drop. I would give it a shot. It could do no worse then what has already happened. Well the first part was no great blunder as TLJ but missed a sense of urgency a build up to RoTS. And then I watched Old Friends Not Forgotten and in my heart was the most painful experience of happiness and sadness in my heart. Name drops and call backs to moments from other parts. I felt rewarded for my love, for my knowledge. I was part of an exclusive club because I was with those who loved Star Wars like me. And as the episode ended amd the credits rolled I came crashing to earth at the destruction and lack of creativity or care take with this amazing franchise. That I was no longer Disney's target audience for Star Wars and that I no longer belonged here... It hurt me...

Would be cool if we saw every battle in the span of 3-4 episodes each. What do you guys think?",Star Wars: The Lost Clone Battles

0,"Bit of a long post here, and I may be completely wrong on this theory, but I welcome discussion and constructive criticism.

We all know Anakin becomes Vader after assisting Sidious in killing Mace Windu. One sign of this is the typical Sith eye color when Vader storms the Jedi Temple and commits Jedi genocide.

However, when on Mustafar, this changes. From the moment Padme and Obi-Wan arrive to the moment he falls from Obi-Wan's final blow, Anakin's eyes are his normal color. 

My theory is this: Anakin did not commit fully to the Dark Side until the END of the duel with Obi-Wan.

For the entirety of the duel, Anakin's eyes are his own. He is allowing a duel to last far longer than it should for a Sith should with such raw power. He even says to Oni-Wan on his last offensive strike: ""This is the end for you, my master.""

If Anakin has accepted Sidious as a new master, why would he address Obi-Wan with the same title? I believe it's because Anakin is confused, scared, and feeling regret. I feel as if that line to Obi-Wan is a projection of his feelings to Sidious, the master who robbed him of his humanity. 

Anakin's eyes shift again when Obi-Wan de-limbs him. You see the fear and pain in his Sith eyes. He didn't want Obi-Wan dead; he wanted Obi-Wan to save him, and he struck him down to die. To me, THAT is the real moment Vader was born.

TL;DR - Anakin didn't commit to the Dark Side until Obi-Wan took a hand instead of giving him a hand.","ROTS: Anakin fell, but was it at the moment we all thought?"

*spoilers for kotor*

Basically I just escaped Tardis, I’m about 10 hours into the game and so far I kind of hate the Jedi? I don’t like the Sith either, they’re awful but so far almost every Jedi I’ve met is so stuck up and acting better than everyone and just kind of rude in general so I don’t really like them, is that normal? 

Like I was actually kind of upset the game made me join the Jedi and do Jedi training. I would of preferred to just stick with normal people like Carth and Mission and go about trying to save the universe. 

I’m assuming the more I get into the game and learn about Jedi and the various Jedi characters maybe I’ll warm up to them (I really hope) and not roll my eyes every time one of them talks down to me.

0,"Hello everyone,

I was rewatching the last Jedi last night and I noticed something in the flash back scene of the temple burning. Luke said that Ben had vanished with a handful of his students and slaughtered the rest. We see a shot of the temple burning and like 5 or 6 bodies in front of R2 and luke. My question is how is this possible? In the kylo ren comic it’s shown that the temple exploded from the storm clouds above and Ben said he never wanted any of this. So how is it possible there were all those dead students in front of Luke if Ben did not kill them. I checked the scene again and the bodies were not burnt so they obviously did not die from the fire or the explosion. They were obviously killed by a person. Did Ben actually kill all those students and we just didn’t see it? Can you guys help me figure out this lore discrepancy? I’m having a hard time envisioning what actually happened on that night at the temple and to those students. Is it a retcon or is there an in-universe lore explanation? Thanks for the help everyone. I really look forward to reading all your replies! :)",Did Ben Solo kill the other students at Luke’s Jedi temple or was it palpatine/snoke’s storm cloud?
0,Because it's simply a safe option to go with in marketing a character. Which is why I will always like seeing characters like Ahsoka on screen because it really disproves the idea that you need to have a human character as a main protagonist to relate to audiences. Right now for the most part alien protagonists in Star Wars don't get a lot of screen time and are usually reduced to being a sidekick and comedic relief or a background character. So whenever we get a character like Ahsoka or somebody like Hera on screen I will always appreciate seeing it.,Honestly for a story that takes place in a galaxy with over a over 3.2 million habitable systems.. Star Wars currently has a problem in overusing human characters as their main protagonist.
0,"So I've heard that the only thing George Lucas considered canon was the first six movies and the clone wars show. And that Legends was not canon because it didn't fall into his view of what canon is. 

So are the new movies part of his canon? I know they are considered canon by lucasfilm and disney since they are owned by them and licensed by them. 

But does George consider them part of his canon or is this like legends where its not part of his universe but still a licensed canon thing. Because I remember a quote by him about how in his universe palpatine didn't come back.

One of the rebel ships then getting stopped by an Interdictor while trying to go into hyper space. Thrawn’s star destroyer then joining the action out of no where. It gave me goosebumps. Then the land battle after the Rebels retreated only to finally escape after taking down the Interdictor. It all was so awesome. I hope to see another Star Wars game with fleet action similar to that of Empire at War or Rogue squadron! What do you guys think?",Has anyone ever played Empire at War?
0,"When the Expanded Universe really started putting out books and comics at the start of the 90's, Heir and Dark Empire were sort of a relaunch with the intention of more interconnected stories, George Lucas and Lucasfilm put a hold on any prequel era stories lest they eventually be contradicted by future movies. Except for tales of the jedi which has Lucas' involvement and was way way before the prequel movies 

However the ""Clone Wars"" was still a major galaxy changing event that was going to come up if anyone talked about the Jedi. So Zhan and others based their small hints of the Clone Wars off of talks with Lucas and Lucasfilm, previous interviews given by Lucas, and the movie its self.

However by 1999 when the Phantom Menace came out Lucas' ideas of what the clone wars and prequel trilogy era looked like greatly differed from the ideas in the nineties ( Which is a bit sad to me as I like some of the ideas better such as the clone wars being longer ago and the purge happening over a greater amount of time. it just makes more sense for people forgetting the jedi.) So some of the thing said about the jedi while vague ended up being a bit contradictory and having to be retconned to fit.

And thinking about it Snoke and Kylo's back story is the same basic thing except over a shorter amount of time.

Now after TROS we know Snoke as a failed clone of Palpatine's. However in the TFA visual dictionary it says multiple things about Snoke that we now know is not true such as him being older than the Empire, being from the unknown regions, having no connection to the sith. In the TLJ novelization we even get Snoke's inner thoughts about his history and meeting the first order. The TLJ visual dictionary plays that angle up even more.

Same for Kylo Ren. In the visual dictionary for TFA it talks about his torture chair being used to hunt down jedi survivors. But based on what we see in Rise of Kylo Ren he knows their are no more survivors. It mentions him as the Jedi Killer and hunting down Jedi but again according to the comic its not exactly how it went down.

Their are also some other minor things about how the FO functions that changes as well with it going from the FO being the one to have people sitting on the boards of directors syphoning off materials to make ships to it being the Sith Eternal

However because this was only over 6 years and not 10 and because they didn't allow any books to really be released during this time period except for the movie tie ins which were all kept pretty vague concerning the things going on. We only really have these issues with the VD and not as much with the books and comics.

Anyways I just made the connection the other day and thought it was a interesting one and shows how no matter how much we love the books and comics and games they are always in danger of having something like a movie or show come along and change the narrative.",The history of Snoke and Kylo is similar to the history of the Clone Wars in Legends but on a shorter time scale.

It's understandable. After 7 seasons of an incredible TV series, you're compressing Anakin's Betrayal into two and half hours, half of which is spent sweeping up Dooku and Grievous.

0,"Was it flawed? Oh hell yeah, nothing is perfect. But does it deserve hate or scorn, no. Could the writing have been better, yeah. Could it have been condensed, maybe. Would it being condensed have taken away from Ahsoka's character growth, who knows.

It gives us a glimpse at two people directly affected by the Jedi and the lack of care for the average person the Jedi developed. And Rafa and Trace were believably written as siblings, they are both a bit naive of the greater galaxy, the younger more so than the older. After all the Jedi caused the death of their parents. And then...Ahsoka enters their lives, an ex-jedi who has no real knowledge of how the Jedi are viewed by the general populace.

Ahsoka learns that most of the galaxy doesn't exactly care for the Jedi, that the Jedi are not viewed as peace keepers, and the Jedi don't exactly look out for the little guy and don't help those who might need help. This causes her to reexamine her view of the Jedi, the view she was taught from the moment she was brought into the order as a child.

The arc was necessary for her character growth. Now some of you might point at the book about her. But it doesn't go properly into her change of view on the Jedi.",I have what might be an unpopular opinion. The Walk About Arc was good.

I also adore movies and i have even written scripts but just for fun. I love watching critiques of movies and tv shows and i love chanells like nostalgia critic, avgn and especially red letter media.

He would do anything for her, even though she doesn’t need it anymore. The action scenes were great. This was an awesome episode and I can’t wait to see what happens next!",[CW S7 SPOILERS] S7:E9 was awesome!
0,"ahsoka's walkabout is critical for her development and maturity as a character in the seventh season.  during this arc, she mainly learns about how normal people view the jedi, something that she hasnt had to encounter before. as we see in the first episode, she still believes that the jedi are good, she still believes that they protect the galaxy, during the conversation with trace, she defends the jedi as peacekeepers in a war that they didnt initiate.

&amp;#x200B;

in a narrative and story sense, this sets up her truth. that the jedi, at their core, are peacekeepers and protect the galaxy. however, throughout the arc, she learns about the  relative poverty of  the lower levels of coruscant, how people have to resort to crime to survive.   how normal people rarely go to the surface, or see the jedi, or even know what they do. thorugout the arc, she realizes that this perception is incorrect. and she learns something more.

Rafa's story about her parents also relates to her own experience. how the jedi are blinded by dogma, to arrogant to admit their own mistakes, whether that be the death of an innocent parent or wronglully accusing a member of their order with treason.

&amp;#x200B;

the jedi consistently use the force as their excuse, that it is the will of the force that these events happen.  both with luminara and mace windu use a similar excuse when faced with the consequences of their actions.

through trace and rafa, ahsoka sees that the jedi are blinded by hubris, and dont actually serve the people they are supposed to be protecting. they have been led astray by politics and the war.

&amp;#x200B;

on a different point, trace and rafa put ahsoka in an awkward position. she has to be and is in a position of experience amongst people who have no experience with the wider galaxy. she needs to lead them and guide them, this makes her a better leader.

trace and rafa also represent two sides of ahsoka, the naive, and the relatively street wise and cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

trace is season 1 ahsoka, over trusting, rash, impatient, kinda clueless rafa is more mature, but still foolish, so season 3 ahsoka. they mirror different stages of ahsokas development.

this leads into episode 9 (spoilers)  where ahsoka is angry at obi wan for not helping the regular people of mandalore in favor of going to save one important political figure. her experiences with trace and rafa  lead her to recognize that she can be an example of what the jedi should be. and she would not be in this position of wisdom in episode 9 if not for meeting trace and rafa.

&amp;#x200B;

i know it probably could have been shorter, but thats just my two cents.

thanks for reading this long!

0,"I just finished the recent episode and it was amazing. With that being said, something crossed my mind when it finished. This was the last time that Anakin and Ahsoka would see each other before Anakin turns to the dark side. It was a touching moment, and I did enjoy it. But, there’s a part of me that didn’t. Let me explain. When we see them meet in Rebels, Ahsoka says “I won’t leave you, not this time”. This line hits hard because the last time they saw one another she was walking away from the Jedi temple leaving him there alone. This was a huge moment and I feel like their interaction in this new episode takes away from that. They part on good terms here with him giving back her lightsabers and wishing one another good luck. It was a great moment, but in the grand scheme of things a part of me wishes they never met face to face. Now you can argue and say that her line in Rebels was calling back to her choice to go to Mandalore while he went to save the Chancellor on Coruscant. But even still, it wouldn’t have the same impact as when she left the Jedi.",Clone Wars

0,"With there being a rumored Old Republic movie trilogy in the works. And there being a reimagined game for the Old Republic, I would like to speculate that Revan is going to be reintroduced back into canon with a new Old Republic EA game that will reimagine his character and his story to make him fit into canon. But in the case of a Old Republic movie trilogy, I think they should do a film with Tarre Vizsla and him during the Mandalorian Wars, I think it would make one interesting film with him struggling to choose sides with the Jedi Order or the Mandalorians. Maybe see his perspective on the Mandalorian wars and him trying to choose a side between the Jedi Order or his people. Maybe we could see him creating the Darksaber, and I think with the right writer and director, it could work. 
I mean, we already have the entire story of Revan, so I don’t think they should just retell it with movies. I want to see something new and interesting that has not been done before.

I don’t know about you guys but I turned into a little kid again when I watched this episode. This season at start was very slow and very not interesting with the first few Ahsoka episode’s with trace and Rafa and then the Bad bad batch arc was not bad but could’ve been worse but then Oh My God! So firstly Anakin being Anakin as he is being unpredictable with his plans with Obi Wan watching him in the background like a concerned father figure, surprising the separatists with a surprise attack. Then soon after Ahsoka comes back with information about Maul being on Mandalore, that’s when Star Wars Episode III starts with the chancellor being kidnapped by Greivous and Count Dooku making Obi Wan and Anakin being unable to join Ahsoka in the assault but not with out Anakin wishing her luck and gives her her old lightsabers that also have a blue color making me want to kill Anakin for changing the colors 😡😡😡. So with a combined attack with the 501st and the Mandolorian’s they go around to try and take control of the city while also find Maul and capture him. Then Ahsoka meets Maul as he comes out seeing it’s not Obi Wan but Ahsoka. With the amazing and talented Sam Witwer playing Darth Maul just made me jump out me seat making me a giddy little kid. Over all this by far has been the best episodes of the series and out of the season. I just can’t wait to see what the other next episodes have in store for us.",Season 7 episode 8 discussion
0,"Think about it. Anakin's lightsaber was destroyed in TLJ. Without a lightsaber, Rey cannot fight Kylo or even hope to confront Palpatine. With time fast running out, she searches through Luke's old books and discovers the location of a hidden cave filled with kyber crystals, miraculously undiscovered and untouched by the old Empire. From there, she undertakes the monumental task of building a lightsaber without the guidance of a master and only old texts for consultation. We see her use her ingenuity and craftiness as a scavenger to fashion a hilt from spare parts and scrap metal, which she imbues with the power of a never-before-seen-in-movie-form *yellow* kyber crystal. She then salvages as many kyber crystals as she can find, as these will be the foundation for training the next generation of Jedi, before leaving the cave and returning to the Resistance.

Right off the bat, this would have been much more compelling than searching for some dumb Sith dagger. In essence, the Sith dagger was nothing more than the search for a map that led to another map that led to a planet. Literally just a MacGuffin for the sake of padding the movie's runtime. However, reframing the journey as a search for a new kyber crystal makes the first act of TROS *so* much more meaningful to the story, because now Rey actually has a personal stake in this search. Without a lightsaber, she simply won't be able to hold her own against Kylo and the First Order. She *cannot* fail here.

Furthermore, calling back to The Old Republic, a Jedi constructing their first lightsaber is a very important milestone and a truly special spiritual experience. This could have been Rey decisively taking her first step into becoming a knight of the Jedi Order. Not only would this have been the first cinematic debut for a yellow lightsaber, but this would have been Star Wars' first cinematic depiction of the construction of a lightsaber. Imagine seeing Rey get frustrated with the complexity of such an alien task, and then finally sitting down and clearing her mind through the Force, allowing the lightsaber to come together on its own. Wouldn't that have been fucking epic? The aesthetic here would play perfectly into Rey's character as well. She isn't simply a Jedi of old; she intends to forge her own path and rebuild the Jedi Order anew. What better way to showcase her idiosyncrasy than by giving her a unique lightsaber color? For that extra cherry on top, give her lightsaber a unique sound the same way they did with Kylo's.

I could go on. Giving Rey a new lightsaber would establish her character growth from the previous 2 movies, and oh would you look at that, it would have been a nice parallel to Episode 6 when Luke also had a new lightsaber! It would have also been a proverbial passing of the torch between the OT/PT and the ST &amp; beyond. As Anakin's lightsaber defined the old era of Star Wars, Rey's new lightsaber will be the symbol of Star Wars' future.

If TROS chose to run with the yellow lightsaber from the beginning, I would have had a lot of respect for them sticking with an original idea for once instead of trying to ride the corpse of motifs and ideas from 40 years ago. I mean, this movie pretty much just repaired Anakin's lightsaber offscreen because it was so afraid of doing something innovative. I can't be the only one here who feels like is cowardly at best. They played it so safe that they ended up with an inferior product. All I can say is that it looks like bad business sense to me, and TROS' glut of pointless, empty goose chases that could have been much more meaningful is a microcosm of what I perceive to be Disney/LucasFilm's lack of vision with this franchise. Ultimately, I am just proposing a what-if scenario here, but my hope is that Disney learns the correct lessons moving forward to ensure that Episode 10 and beyond are the best that they can be.","I love Rey's yellow lightsaber at the end of TROS, and I really wish it saw more action than a cameo at the end of a movie. So it got me thinking. What if instead of a Sith dagger goose chase, the first act of TROS was dedicated to Rey's search for a new kyber crystal to build her own lightsaber?"
0,"I wasn’t ready.

Ok, so aside from basically crying like a child seeing all of the Jedi spread out as they were in Episode III, I was confused as to why Ahsoka seemed uncharacteristically cold towards both Anakin and Obi Wan.

In her “sentencing”, those were (if I remember right), the only two actually supporting her innocence? It’s even mentioned when she is expelled that it was not unanimous.

I get that she felt betrayed by the Jedi, but damn girl those were the only two who stuck with you. 😂

0,"After the speeder crash in AOTC, Zam hides out in a bar. A hugely overlooked part of her character (in the movie that is) is that she is a changeling. Anyone with a reasonable degree of common sense and situational awareness, something a bounty hunter should definitely have, would morph and slip out while Anakin and Obi-Wan were occupied. Instead, she decides, for some reason, to attempt to shoot Obi-Wan in the back at point blank range. Jedi are fairly distinct looking in comparison to any normal security force, so she definitely knew she was being chased by them, so walking very close to one of them is the worst possible decision she could have made. She's a hack, and handily the worse bounty hunter/contracted assassin we have seen in Star Wars. At least Greedo had believed he had the upper hand til the bitter end.

EDIT: They also take her out a back door at the end of the chase, so she could have also slipped out that door far away from either of the two Jedi and completely avoided detection.

0,"I'm not sure if people realize it but the upcoming Siege of Mandalore arc has set itself up to be the conclusion to almost every major story arc in the series. For a show that first began as an anthology series, this finale has consolidated almost every single major story arc into just one finale.

* **Maul/Mandalore**. Two storylines that have already been consolidated on their own, and themselves are products of consolidation (Maul's storyline being a product of Ventress's and the Nightsisters arc. Hell, even Ventress's arc itself is a consolidated one, dealing with the bounty hunter episodes that came before and more.).

* **Ahsoka in general**. Again, this is something that has had a lot of consolidation. Many of the political arcs have consolidated into Ahsoka's central storyline. Padme's political bits fed into the Mina Bonteri assassination, which led to Lux Bonteri, which again fed right into both Ahsoka and the Mandalore arcs.

* **The Clone Troopers.** Between the storylines of Domino Squad, Rex as his own character, this entire storyline has taken us from training, to their first mission on Rishi, to Umbara, and finally to the Inhibitor Chip arc. And with Order 66 right around the corner, this will have a role to play in it all too.

Almost every significant storyline in the series has fused together into this one finale. The only two really major ones that *don't* are the Mortis arc and Yoda's odyssey arc, both of which are very spiritual and make more sense as one-offs anyhow. Others like the slavers arc aren't fundamentally essential but feed into the other side of the story, the one we've already seen (AKA Revenge of the Sith).

In the last 6 seasons, the showrunners spent so much time consolidating everything so it could all be tied up here in this final arc. That's incredible. I don't know how it took me so long to realize that's what was going on.","The Clone Wars started as an anthology.

The Jedi are assumed to be perfect heroes who keep the peace, but as we look into them more (especially in The Clone Wars) they're not as perfect as they are thought to be. They never allowed showing of emotions (which is mentally unhealthy) and they said ""the force works in mysterious ways"" when they realized Ahsoka was framed, even though that's their shit excuse to make up for their lacking perspectives.

0,"Tomorrow, the final four episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars begins.  I have seen a lot of people predict we will see Order 66.

And it looks like we are going to see part of the Battle of Mygeeto.  Personally though, I would actually like to see Kato Nemodia, and what happened there with Anakin saving Obi-Wan for the 9th time, and why it doesn't count.  

However, the one I am hoping to see, and it looks like we may get it, unless I am reading too much into a trailer and scenes of a space battle, is the opening of the Battle of Coruscant.  As a fan of the 2003 Genndy Tartakovsky Clone Wars series, I enjoyed seeing the Battle of Coruscant as the series ended tying it to the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  In Legends, it is pretty epic, with Separatist ships crashing out of hyperspace into Republic ships as carriers land on the planet, but with Disney getting rid of a lot of that for their new canon, I kind of think this is one they needed to do, or at least show us the beginning.  This is one of the largest and final battles of the war, fought on the surface, the sky and in space, commanded by Count Dooku and all while General Grievous is on a mission to capture Chancellor Palpatine.  Of all the ways to end the series, I kind of feel the Battle of Coruscant should be the finale, or at least we should see part  of it.","Doubt it will happen, but would love to see the Battle of Coruscant in the final four"

Mark Hamill was criminally underused in the whole trilogy and he deserved better. Giving him the role to play a dark side version of Luke would've been a treat. I also feel like it would change the meaning of Luke's vision in Dagobah to a prophecy. They could've had this clone have a connection to real Luke that influenced him for a couple moments to consider killing Ben as well. I would have used the younger Luke we see in the brief scene with Leia finishing her training to protest him.

0,"In the cartoon series “Star wars the Clone Wars”, S1 Ep2 the separatists have a ship called the Malevolent. The ship had an ion cannon which would disable ships electrical systems, making engines, shields, life support, and weapons systems not work. In the Revenge of the Sith, the opening scene is a battle over Coruscant. If the separatists sent A fleet in and then sent multiple ships with ion cannons, the ships with ion cannons could take out groups of Republic ships because they can’t fire back. Making it so the separatist could destroy the whole blockade more efficiently. That would then make way for a ground attack if they wanted. They would then have been able to take coruscant. This in turn would give them most all major hyperspace lanes lead that lead to Coruscant. They then would have most the senate, the chancellor, and all the war prisoners.

0,"My two biggest requests are

* An animated series about Luke's Jedi Academy, with Mark Hamill voicing
* A comic or novel about Leia training as a Jedi

The latter could work as a story in the former, but only if Hamill didn't voice. Given that Mark's voice sounds nothing like it did 37 years ago, I would want it to be an older, wiser Luke, and obviously that story happened quickly after RotJ. Plus it'd be weird to have Mark Hamill opposite someone other than Carrie Fisher as Leia.

For the animated series, it would be cool to get cameos from Matt Lanter, Tom Kane, and Stephen Stanton as Anakin, Yoda, and Ben, respectively to advise Luke.

I want a comic for Leia's training, as I believe a story without an external conflict lends itself to the medium. Being able to physically see Leia as a Jedi, assembling her own lightsaber, would be cool for me, and since it wouldn't work in a movie I'd love to see it in a comic.

So we get a force ghost Han that meets with Kylo that eventually wins him over to the Light Side. This moment didn’t really make sense to me as Han being a force ghost in the first place makes no sense. Also Kylo never really cared about what his dad had to say in the first place. I mean he killed the guy. So I thought, who else could that be that turned Kylo?

And then, the perfect answer came to me...Anakin. Who else better to explain the internal battle between the Light Side and the Dark Side than the great Jedi council member turned Sith Lord turned savior of the rebellion.  Also, it’s been shown to us over and over again how much Kylo worships his grandfather. He worships his mask. Little did he know that Anakin killed the emperor the first time. Anakin breaking that news to him and explaining how much the dark side cost him could help Kylo see the light. It’d be super impactful. 

It would sit better with fans as well I think, knowing that it was because of Anakin’s influence that the Force was balanced at the end. The prophecy was still true in a clear way on screen instead of it being a debate amongst fans. Also I think everyone would’ve loved to see Hayden make one last appearance.

0,"There’s a lot of quiet in Star Wars really only filled with the TV shows and comics, while the shows and comics are all good in their own way I think the majority of people who like Star Wars still want a great Star Wars movie.

This “quiet” I’m referring to are the timeskips in between the films, minus the sequels who seem to take place almost back to back. The main ones being the 19 years between revenge of the sith and a new hope and the 30 years between Return of the Jedi and The force awakens. With the smaller ones of 10 years between episodes 1 and 2 and 2-3 years between episodes 2 and 3. I’m not mentioning the time gaps between the sequels because I personally wouldn’t want a Star Wars story inbetween any sequel film, possibly during one though from a different perspective during the events is an interesting idea.

With the “decanonisation” of a lot of media in the Star Wars universe this left a lot of blank slates to fill. There are a lot of stories I’d love to see on the big screen, brining ashoka to the big screen, possibly a retelling of the starkiller story, a clone focused story between episodes 2 and 3, or the complete reverse an empire loyalist film about stormtroopers, showing anakin and obi-wan on adventures while training before the clone wars. There’s a lot of potential stories and a lot of room to fit them into.

A prime candidate was “Kenobi: A Star Wars Story” but is instead being worked as a series and that’s fine. Although I do worry because, I think we can agree that some parts of The Mandalorian felt stretched, maybe chalk it up to a first season going through its trial run and finding its feet.

I think the majority of the fans think Rogue One is the best Star Wars film released under Disney and I agree it is for many reasons but it renders down to a grittier Star Wars film with down to Earth characters. Plus the Vader scene alone is pure gold. 

Rogue one is pretty much what I personally want in a Star Wars movie today the force users and lightsabers take a step back for an intimate and relatable human story, but then when the force and lightsabers do appear it makes them all the more impressive and impactful.

It’s a shame that Solo was a monetary flop, it had a lot of things working against it, it wasn’t a particularly demanded character to make a story about, it was the later film of the month after Avengers Infinity War and Deadpool 2 had been released and overall the film itself felt like a cut together recap of a Han Solo based series instead of a solid origin story.

With that said I think Solo provided a viable set up for continuing the Star Wars story mindset but through a connected side trilogy instead of one offs that connect to the main films, especially with the Maul cliffhanger. But I’m comfortable with either one as long as good stories are told well, although since solo didn’t perform well I think Disney are leaning away from the Star Wars story films for now.

As for a new full on trilogy that’s potentially completely new I really want Disney to take their time because the sequels not only felt rushed and threw together at times but the main problem is that there is virtually no consistency of storytelling between each film in the sequels.

0,"I started a rewatch of the Mandalorian and it makes a lot more sense why places would discriminate against droids in the original trilogy. A lot of people probably lost families and friends to droid attacks during the clone wars, so there naturally would be some resentment/discrimination against droids (even if they were being controlled by organics).

Star wars has got *layers* to it, ya see. Probably an obvious thing that has already been shared, but I wanted to chime in with my own realization.",I realized Droid discrimination in the Original Trilogy makes a lot more sense after watching the Mandalorian
0,"What if... I think anybody thought atleast once about what way the story would have gone if Anakin had chosen againt Palpatin or what if Luke had joined Vader and so on. Those are stories the are pretty interesting and heartwarming if you think about us getting to see Anakin and Padme rasing Luke and Leia in a healthy Republic.

Now given the fact that Disney is doing something similar for Marvel, i propose that we bring it to their attention that we also would like something like that for Star Wars. 
It could be done in an Cartoon Version like the Marvel one or more animted like Clonewars for instance with Storyarcs going only one or up to like four episodes like clonewars does it.

I wish more than anything that these story threads would've continued, and get a glimmer of hope every time I re-read Legends material or see existing canon material incorporate this wonderful material (see: The Clone Wars use of Delta Squad in the Citadel arc).

I am not saying Rouge one is the worse Star war movie ever (that goes for Attack of the Clones and Rise of Skywalker close second) but I failed to see how many people consider this as what star wars should be.

Obviously by action standard it is the most grounded and intense star war movie by far but in term of plot and characterization which make up like 80% of the movie? They are all forgettable.

I mean there is no such thing as basic development. Two main cast barely even talk to each other for more than 10 minutes aside from one scene where they yell at each other in a ship but their conflict is immediately resolve with little to no effort 

Beside Donnie Yen character, chirruit, and K2SO there are so little reason to care about any of the cast. And these 3 arent even good they simply have more personality than this dull cast. 

It by no mean a bad movie but I failed to see why anybody think this is what star wars should be. A movie that lack proper characterization and put no effort into the narrative for sake of cool action. 

I mean for false of both Sequel and Prequel for all their inconsistency and bad dialogue and script at least there is an attempt in all these movies to develop the characters and give them an arcs.

I love the character of Ahsoka too and can’t wait for the final arc of clone wars. I just feel that the mandalorian is a show removed from the rest of the series, and bringing Ahsoka in would only hinder its own story. It feels more like they are trying to shove a well liked character into a show just for the views. I personally feel Ahsoka would not fit a live action show at all, and that the mandalorian should work harder to be its own thing, not leaning on any other characters from the star wars universe. I thought I would ask everyone else’s views on the matter to see why other people think differently or along the same lines.

0,"This is my opinion, I'm totally fine with people disagreeing.

  
The main reason this is my opinion is that he failed to plan out the whole trilogy when writing TFA. TFA is, in my opinion, ok, it has its strengths and weaknesses. It copies too much from the original trilogy but can make up to it because of the addition of mystory elements. For example the mystory about Rey, the Knights of Ren and the lightsaber.

  
The problem with the mystory elements is that some of them are never redeemed. I have no idea who the Knights of Ren are.

  
A big problem both of his movies have is the lack of pauses, although it is much worse in ROS. Both movies are always leaping from one activity to the next.

  
Another problem is that ROS is really bad on two levels. If you look at it as a movie it has the above-mentioned pacing problems. If you look at it from a story perspective, especially if you take the whole trilogy into account, you get plot holes unsolved mystories and reversions of story arcs. Especially the decision to make Rey a Palpatine removes all the meaning from TLJ. If J. J. Abrams wanted Rey to be a Palpatine he could have set that up by writing the overarching storyline for the trilogy.

  
As you might have noticed I think if you intend on making a movie trilogy you start by writing an overarching storyline. Of course, you can tweak it while making the movies, but if you make them one by one you can easily get problems. If you want to argue that the original trilogy wasn't made as a trilogy, you are right, but after the success of TLH Lukas had at least planned ahead for ROTJ.

  
This problem was only partly created by J. J. Abrams and mostly Disneys fault.I am not saying that TLJ is the best Star Wars movie, but as a movie, it is definitely the best of the sequel trilogy.

A band of creative brothers and I will be making a full lengthed Star Wars fan film. And I need your help in thinking of a title for it. Obviously, if you're able to help, you'll be credited in the movie! 🙂 

PLOT:
This film will take place after the events of Star Wars: VI: The Return of the Jedi but concludes minutes before the events of Star Wars: VII: The Force Awakens. 
It follows protagonist, Bruce. A former Stormtrooper with the Galactic Empire. Who, since the events of The Return of the Jedi has been traveling from galaxy to galaxy searching for nothing more than inner tranquility. 
Bruce reluctantly befriends a girl, who for now will be called, The Messenger. From her, Bruce learns about the First Order's plan to eliminate the Resistance, and the New Republic's plan to back the Resistance.
He also learns that The Messenger has secretly been exchanging and getting information from two different people, inside the First Order and the Resistance. Both of which don't want to be part battle.
Wanting to fight against the Resistance and the New Republic, but unwilling to join the First Order due to their hallowing methods of recruiting future Stormtroopers, Bruce teams up with The Messenger and the two from the First Order and Resistance. 
His plan to eliminate General Leia Organa directly. 
Before doing so, the First Order and Resistance learn of Bruce's Galactic Empire past and his current plan. While one attempts to recruit him and the other tries to eliminate him. They both also learn about the betrayal of one of their troops and the Messenger.

0,"I've recently been rewatching the Clone Wars series including the final season as the come out week by week, and I honestly feel like episode 3 would need to be remade. There's just too much of a lack of emotion in the characters towards so many things when you go back and rewatch the movie. There's no emotional ties to the clone army. The whole scene between Obi Wan and Grievous make it seem like it's their first time meeting when it's contradicted by the CW series. Anakin still lacks a depth of character to him, as do the others in some instances. They just don't feel like battle hardened Jedi/soldiers/whatever you would like to call them. It's just jarring to see the stark contrast between the two mediums. 

I understand that the CW series came way after the movie to fill in the gaps between episodes 2 and 3, but in doing so it makes me want more out of RotS. I know with these last four episodes of the series it'll cross over into episode 3 so there will be some retconning/reimagining of some scenes from the movie, but I feel like that wouldn't be enough.

0,"The show as a whole is good. The early episodes are alittle too campy but everything is in high gear and primo quality by season 3. This is not putting down any other aspect of the show just highlighting what I think is the strongest arc of it.

To me the Clones are the best part of the show because despite looking the same and having the same voice actor they seem like real people with very different traits and personalities. In contrast despite the droids being made more intelligent and vocal for the show they by design come of as still same same compared to each other.

I just re-watched the general Krell arc and to me this is the best arc of the show because it highlights the individuality of the clones, their ability to move past their programming and make real choices for real principles. Not to mention the tragedy of their eventual brainwashing and turning on their friends.

Whats more this arc stirs in me a emotional response the likes of which the rest of the show cant evoke. When the clones are sent by krell to attack umbarrans posing as clones only to realize they have been killing each other this really hit home. I actually teared up alittle bit cause you felt the pain. There are episode from shows every now and then that just hit you. The Krell arc hits me with the same emotion i felt when watching (showing my age reference) the fresh prince of belaire which normally is a stupid campy show but the episode when Will accidentally gives carlton speed or the episode when wills dad comes back and the leaves again and uncle Phil hugs him at the end. Thats the same emotion I felt in this arc.

After re-watching this im actually surprised this was on cartoon network during the daytime hours given how violent the show is especially this arc. Usually the censor doesnt let straight up gunfights or on screen deaths get through.

The biggest talking I just can’t get around is the graphics. The scenery in the game is nice, but the actual graphics of the gameplay is something I just can’t get around.

The Original Trilogy started with a Galaxy on the brink of civil war, and then later turn into an actual war, and the ending of said war, which was supposed to be final, more or less. 

The Prequels showed us the rise and fall of one of the most influential movie villains of all time. 

Sure, each of these trilogies had large-scale wars happening during their stories, but the stakes weren't always at the max right at the beginning, and going non-stop even after the movie ends. The Galaxy wasn't *always* in danger of some great peril right then and there. There wasn't some kind of endgame happening in each movie. We had scenes of character development, and growth. Of actual *story building.*

All it's been reduced to is pretty colors, flashy fight scenes, and an occasional spoken line about some large plot point. And the plot doesn't even make sense.

0,"Posted this about a week ago. Still looking for opinions.

Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.

Which leads to my current dilemma. I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.

I am completely torn on this because she Loves it and I kind of like it but I am a big ""Risk mitigation"" kind of person that wholeheartedly believes in controlling the controllables and being happy with results after that and so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.
Any help is appreciated.",Anakin Baby Name? [Long]
0,"I think that at the end of Rise of Skywalker both Rey and Ben were Jedi. If you think back to episode 8 ben had Jedi training. He was used and twisted by the dark used just like anakin was. Which leads me to one of my biggest complaints about Rise of Skywalker. Ben died. I understand the poetic justice of it but at the end of the day it the movie would’ve been better if he hadn’t died. Think about it. In every trilogy there was one main romantic duo. In the prequels it was anakin and padme, in the original trilogy it was luke I mean Han and Leia. The fact that it was 3 movies in the making for that to finally happen, all that anticipation, just to be let down like that. And I know some people didn’t want them to kiss but like I said every trilogy had a couple. 

Imagine all the theories we could’ve formulated if he hadn’t died.Assuming he didn’t die, Rey and ben *kiss* they leave exegol with the resistance and they go to the base to say their goodbyes to their friends. They then leave and head for Luke’s island.  Or some other isolated location. The war is over and just like Han and Leia they settle down and start a family. Just like the Skywalker way they have twins. A boy and a girl. Rey and Ben along with the help of force Jedi before them start the new jedi order. Years go by and new force sensitive people appear all across the galaxy to be trained into Jedi. (Alternate theory with the war over and the force finally balanced there is no more conflict. Rey and ben have kids and die of old age happily married.)  Somehow, someway, palpa- kidding lol. Some new threat that I couldn’t care less about naming or giving a backstory to finds a planet with sith holocrons on it and learns the ways of the darkside. Then said sith vows to destroy the Jedi for some backstory reason. Oh and Ashoka could be in it. There’s been other theories by people that have said Ashoka is alive and she just went into hiding.

0,"Just finished the movie (very late to the game, I know) and if anyone could answer/expand on these questions, I'd be grateful. I have a million thoughts going through my head right now, so sorry if something here was actually explained in the movie and I missed it!

Alright, here it goes:

1. What's up with the Palpatine cult on Exegol? Why is there a planet full of people stanning Sheev's wrinkly ass? What do they get out of giving him life support and building his crazy fleet for decades? Where did these guys even come from??
2. That brings me to the fleet. How did Palpatine have the cash and tech to build a fleet so advanced it has death star lasers on every ship? Even at the height of his power, with all the tech and money at his disposal, the best he could do was the death star and then death star 2.0. Are the Palpatine cultists secretly genius engineers rolling in cash? Does exegol just happen to have all the materials needed to build a fleet of that size? My best guess is this was a long work in progress from maybe even before he became emperor, but that's still a stretch and it doesn't explain why he didn't use exegol and his possibly genius cult until after he hit the sack.
3. Why would palpatine go to all this trouble to build a massive fleet in secret only to announce it to the whole galaxy? Wouldn't it be better to surprise attack the galaxy? I didn't really see any point of his whole broadcast, but Palpatine has always had a flair for the dramatic so I guess he wanted to take over in style.
4. How is Rey related to Palpatine again? I wasn't 100% clear on that. I read that Rey's father was Palpatine's clone/son, but how would that make Rey so force-sensitive? I might be mistaken but I thought it was extremely hard to make force-sensitive clones, unless it was just some kind of coincidence that she happened to be so strong with the force.

So I know this is an incredibly long shot, but I've been looking for this one collage I saw that showed up on the front page online and I've been having a lot of trouble finding it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was basically this collage of (I want to say a bar) -- very detailed -- that had basically EVERY science fiction/geek fandom-related character in it all stuffed together. I'm talking Picard, Millenium Falcon, Iron Man, the xenomorph -- all the staples of the nerdy things we all love. I wanted to use it as a reference for a project I'm currently doing with our art director. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance. I have the picture in my mind's eye and I thought I saved it a year or two ago, but it has since been lost to the sands of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated!

0,"Hello all! I have never seen a single Star Wars movie in my life and frankly, know NOTHING about the franchise. I know, I’m a disgrace, but I was hoping for someone to help me out on getting started! I’ve finally decided to start getting into the series (since I’m a huge sci-fi fan anyways) but I just have absolutely no idea where to begin. I don’t even know plots or premises! Someone want to help me out and let me know which movie to start with? Perhaps even give me a small synopsis of the world and storyline? No spoilers obviously, just want help getting started off!","New to Star Wars, need help!"
0,"Do we have any answer as if the force is instantaneous or not? Because as far as we know there is actual science behind the force with midichlorians. So initially I’d guess the force is as fast as probably your neurons transmitting signals to each other which would be up to 268mph. However, as we’ve seen with the force dyad and even essence transfer, it seems that either the force is just instant or literally creates wormholes and goes through them to transmit signals in a seemingly instantaneous matter. Based on probability, Palpatines essence transfer traveled at least 10,000 light years away given that exogol is on the outer rim of the galaxy. Do you think that he instantly essence transferred to another body or that it took some time and he was traveling through space for a while. This is such a ridiculous question lmao but it’s how my brain works",How Fast is the Force?
0,"I assume Star Wars ships follow our real world rules, where the amount of fuel (Tibanna gas? Coaxium?) necessary to power a ship is directly proportional to the ship's mass. That being said, I think that once you get to ships that are a kilometer long and over, that fuel becomes a really big problem. A freighter like the Millennium Falcon might need only a few kilograms of fuel, but a Star Destroyer or even a Super Star Destroyer would need a ridiculously massive amount of fuel proportional to its mass. How the hell do they power those things? In order to run the *Executor* for a day, you would probably need to harness the entire power output of Planet Earth, and that probably wouldn't be enough to cover the hyperdrive and weapons systems.

It gets even hairier when we get into superweapon status, where not only does said vessel have to power itself, but it has to power a planet killing superlaser. It's established that the Death Stars utilize kyber crystals to enhance and focus energy, but in order to generate even a fraction of the power needed to vaporize a planet, they would need a reactor with a level of output that could rival a star. And what would power that reactor? No amount of coaxium or Tibanna gas would be physically or financially reasonable in this case. Starkiller Base is exempt here, as we know it draws its power from a nearby star. But what about the Xyston Class Star Destroyers from *The Rise of Skywalker*? Given that they have Death Star tech shrunk down into a cannon several hundred meters long, I imagine the weapon runs on some sort of exotic fuel, but where do they get this power from? Is there a special refueling station for planet killers? How do they generate this fuel? So many questions.

I know this is a relatively mundane question in the Star Wars universe, but without fuel, ain't nobody going nowhere. And given the fact that the Star Wars 'verse has some of the biggest starships in all of science fiction, I think it is reasonable to speculate just how commonplace/accessible fuel is in Star Wars.",What powers the superweapons and really big ships in Star Wars?
0,"Timothy Zahn wrote a short story in which Grand Admiral Thrawn completed a solo mission for Vader. I believe the Emperor was unaware of the mission. This story is not Canon now. However, I came away believing at the time that Vader and Thrawn met somewhat frequently in and around the Unknown Regions. I assert that the Emperor tasked Vader to report on the Imperial presence in the Unknown Regions. I thought that over time Vader and Thrawn developed a mutual respect for each other. I also believed they knew that the Empire would be better served with new leadership. I thought it would have been a great story. Vader and Thrawn preparing to destroy Palpatine and together rule their envisioned Empire. A plan evolving over some years. In secret, Vader would have had his arms,legs and organs regrown from cloning. I believe Sidious falsely claimed that Vader's shell of a body made it impossible to accept regrown organs and limbs. Sidious knew Vader,if whole, would become far more powerful than himself. In my mind, Vader had an apprentice in the Unknown Regions overseen by Thrawn. Vader and Thrawn knew the Rebels were an enormous threat. Both were against the creation of both Death Stars. And the Empire was streched too thin. The plans of the Lord and Admiral would restructure many things. 
Today,a new Canon. And Timothy Zahn reawkens my Vader/Thrawn plans with 'Thrawn: Alliance.' Of course their devious plans would never see fruition. BUT I look forward to Zahn writing more stories about these two Star Wars characters.",Vader and Thrawn
0,"Not really going to follow this all the way through but I always felt the titles of the new films vs the plot of the films left a lot to be desired.

The Force Awakens. I'm thinking there's a huge awakening. People all over the galaxy suddenly have this connection to the world around them. New force users born or infused with the gift. Similar to Legend of Korra Airbenders are all but extinct and than BAM there's a huge awakening and people are scared.

In this version Kylo Ren (who killed the last of the jedi and sent Luke into exile still a valid plot point) would dispatch the Knights of Ren to hunt down and purge any new force users. (great great potential right like the Nazguul for The great eye, but never used)

Meanwhile Leia and the what probably should be an established and recgonized republic army by now track down to save and train as many as they can. Leia completed her training with Luke but understands she is way in over her head, she can't possibly lead the republic against the Order and train new jedi. She needs Luke. All still valid.

When Ren stops at the village massacre and looks at Finn, you think its cuz Finn didn't shoot. Kylo ignores it. But really in that Moment Finn was also hit by the Awakening. This opens it up for Finn and Rey to be Jedi

This also opens the films up for a, say, 10 year time jump. I loved the visual at the end of Last Jedi. The boy growing up with stories of the resistance and being saved by them and using the force to grab the broom. PERFECT ITS AN AWAKENING. Flash forward to see this new generation of force users.

They aren't being killed. They are being taken. To be siphoned. To power and drain the solar energy to power a factory combined with the siphoned force energy to create LIFE. This idea comes from The Old Republic. Weapons, droids, armor, everything being created from thin air almost magically.

And Rey IS a nobody. Like Kylo said let it die man. Star wars is infinite. This is new. Get away from Skywalkers and Vader and Palpatine. In my version Rey would be a nobody like the kid at the end of Last Jedi. Nobody from nowhere. But that's exactly what makes them special.

Obviously there's a lot of gaps in here I haven't filled in. And its easy to to just plug and play when the templates were already laid out. But thats exactly why these movies could've been so much better, because the templates were all there the material was all there. So many good ideas to pull inspiration from.

The Force Awakens across the galaxy
The Last Jedi isn't, they're all out there.
Rise of Skywalker I would've loved to see the teachings and beliefs of Luke Skywalker, the way of Skywalker, be passed down. This new philosophy of ""time it is for the Jedi to end, to look passed old books"" This idea would be called the way of Skywalker. The jedi term and way of life are replaced by the skywalker term and way of life. Like calling someone a Knight or a Samurai, Skywalker is now a term. The Rise of Skywalker is the rise of this new breed of force users. People like Finn and Rey who are neutral or grey Jedi. Think Jedi Outcast. Blaster toting, lightning using, saber weilding wanderers of good.",How it could've ended
0,"You're hired to direct the second movie in the new Star Wars trilogy. You sit down to start the process of writing, well before TFA has finished post-production. You seperately have lunch with Lawrence Kasdan and coffee with J.J. Abrams. You even probably get to see a rough cut of the film. The first thing you realize is that the entire plot revolves around tracking down Luke Skywalker, who has disappeared onto an island for... some reason? J.J. and Larry don't really have any particular trajectory in mind so you're left to come up with a good reason why the heroic Jedi of the OT has exiled himself.

There has to be a good reason why he would be here, despite the peril in the galaxy. You decide immediately that it can't be cowardice or selfishness. It has to be an active, positive reason. You are led to an interesting notion, one that might really provide a shake-up while preserving the characters integrity. Luke has come to the conclusion that the Jedi are fundamentally flawed, perpetuating a cycle of conflict, and that they need to go away so that the light will rise from another source to overcome the Dark Side. Luke genuinely believes he's doing the right thing for the galaxy and suddenly his exile becomes an act of self sacrifice; he is carrying the burden of knowing that his family and friends are fighting this war but he chooses not to engage with the conflict.

Okay, that sounds interesting. So what story could you possibly come up with that would've led Luke to this kind of conclusion? There has to be a convincing reason why he thinks the Jedi need to end. There's obviously 30+ unseen years after ROTJ that you could explore, but you've got a lot of story to continue telling for all the new characters and you can't spend too much time exploring the past. Do you consider flashbacks? That's never really been done in Star Wars but it seems necessary. You decide to focus on one moment that will serve as both the catalyst for Ben Solo's still unexplained turn to the Dark Side, and a dramatic, personal failure on Luke's part. 

You conceptualize a scene where Luke discovers that Ben Solo has been manipulated and all but turned to the Dark Side. Just as in TESB, he sees a vision of future; of the death and the destruction of everything he loves at the hands of Kylo Ren. For ""the briefest moment of pure instinct"" he fearfully grabs his lightsaber, but immediately recoils in shock. With shame, he looks down to see the frightened face of his nephew, but before he can explain himself Ben attacks. He wakes to find his temple burning to the ground and all of his students slaughtered. The weight of an unimaginable guilt and sorrow comes crashing down as he looks on helplessly. It would be enough to break any man. This is all his fault. He has completely and utterly failed.

You now have a traumatic moment of heartbreak and misunderstanding that serves effectively to change Luke in profound way, but you know the story can't end there. This is a truly dark place for this character, but you now have to bring him back to a place of redemptive heroism. You decide on a scene where Yoda appears to Luke to have one last lesson. To show him that failure doesn't define him and that the galaxy does still need the Jedi. As you think about the climax of Luke's story arc you realize that you want him to face Kylo Ren, but Kylo can't die. And you don't want Kylo to kill Luke in battle, effectively repeating Han's death. You want Luke to die on his own terms, with peace and purpose. So you're led to the idea of a Force Projection. This would allow Luke to reunite with Leia and face Kylo, outsmarting him in the process. 

Add to that some moments of visual storytelling. At the beginning of the first act you have Luke throw away his Father's lightsaber. In the second act you have him refuse it again after revealing the truth of his worst failure. Then, at the climax of the story, you have Luke choosing to appear with that same saber, symbolising that he has finally accepted it from Rey. He has reclaimed his legacy, overcome his failure and returned as the hero that will single handedly save the Resistance and spark a ""new hope"" in the galaxy. In a moment a poetry and rhyming that would do George Lucas proud, he peacefully becomes one with the Force under the light of a binary sunset. His journey has come full circle.",You just got hired to direct Episode 8!

0,I'm currently playing Battle Front 2 and it's a really engaging plot even if your just doing the main story-line. I like how they finally give Emperial soldiers some attention in this game. It's got me wondering if maybe like the Mandalorian a series or movie should be made that focus's on storm troopers and them fighting rebels. I like the idea of rebels being the bad guys for once because there were if I'm not mistaken lots of factions and I think it'd be interesting to see a faction that committed terrorist acts and were full of extremists and to have a group of storm troopers charged with going after them but for the story to ultimately end with the surviving troopers questioning their loyalty to the Empire.,Think we'll ever get a movie/series based or centered around empire soldiers?
0,"I think it’s use in TROS was pretty terrible, to be honest. It’s overly powerful, seemingly no draw backs to using it (at least for Rey) and it’s pretty much a deus ex machina ability. It’s potential is so powerful, that my nerfs will be pretty big.

It also has no basis in current canon, other than Mando which came out at the same time. I’d improve this too. 

Balance tweaks:

It takes a long time in meditation before the skill is usable. Length required depends on the severity of the wound, as well as skill with the power. 
Example.. if Kenobi knew the power, he still wouldn’t have been able to heal Jinn because it would’ve taken too long.

It would require a very long time of dedicated training to become able to use it at all. I’m thinking long enough that all skilled practitioners would be very old (assuming they’re human). I would write the skill so that it would be almost solely used by alien species with longer life spans. A new Jedi rank would be created for healers, as their skills would be pretty much just limited to healing, so their saber and other force abilities would be on par with an average padawan. They’d be like the party healer in an MMO.
 
I wouldn’t have the power be about life force transfer, but about midichlorian manipulation. It is strenuous to use, so the frail may expire from using it too much. My idea here is that it’s the light side version of what Plagueis can do




Story improvements (setting up healing as an ability):

I would have Yoda mention it was something he used to be able to do, whilst he is on his deathbed with Luke. He’d only bring it up after Luke says “but Master Yoda, surely there must be a force ability to help you”

There would be a couple of scenes in episode 2 where some older padawans, nearing their trainings end, would go with a Jedi Master healer to start their training down those lines. Yoda would say to Obi Wan something about how he thinks Anakin would’ve been good at it, if he was calmer and chose that route.

In episode 3, I would have a healer accompany Windu and his chosen masters when they attempt to arrest Sheev. Fisto would suffer more minor injuries instead of just dying, and Windu takes up a role of keeping Sidious engaged so the healer can help Fisto. In the end, Windu accidentally leaves an opportunity for Sidious, which he takes, and fires a harsh bolt of lightning at the healer which kills him instantly.



My story improvements are minor in terms of the plot, but it does show its rules and limitations whilst making it actually feel a part of the Jedi skill set. What do you guys think? I hope you like my ideas :)","Force Healing, how I’d balance and improve it."
0,"I really don't understand what they were going for with the whole ""anyone can be a great Jedi"" message in TLJ. What's the point of communicating that when the protagonist is naturally gifted anyway? By the end of TFA, Rey is already powerful, altruistic and surrounded by people who appreciate her, so how is that message supposed to be compelling at all? 

Compare this to Ratatouille for example, which also has a similar ""a good chef can come from anywhere"" message. I don't think that movie would have worked if everyone was just fine with the idea of Remy being a chef to begin with. Another example is Shazam, which has a similar 'orphaned child finds belonging' story. Billy's character arc would not have worked if he wasn't the same selfish kid with a sugar-coated memory of his childhood. 

Wouldn't it have been better if Rey was an actual nobody with minimal force sensitivity and didn't win some cosmic genetic lottery? I think that is one reason I like Kenobi. He's not the most powerful Jedi, but he's certainly one of the greatest.",Rey's main character trait

0,"I'm not a super fan of Star Wars, kinda new to it. But I have a theory depending on the answer to this question:  
Did the Jedi's efforts to make all Force masters saints, and the Sith's efforts to keep only two truly evil Force masters alive at one time develop this black and white that the Force draws people to, or is it just the Force's will to make most of those sensitive to it either Dark or Light?

To elaborate, if the Force simply seeks a balance between Light and Dark, and the Jedi only train and accept saints; then the only option is to make truly evil individuals stand to balance it out. Especially if the Sith eliminate most exiles that don't live up to the Jedi council's expectations. If the Jedi have created this ""no grey can exist within the Force"" rule and the Force is following it, then have they actually been doing more harm than good the whole time by making those on the dark side so cruel and powerful?",What came first?

0,"I have been thinking too much about the logistics in the starwars movies.  
In th sequals we have been told the first order is a smaller force of empire remnants and child soldiers but then they lose massive structures like star killer base and their flagship (greatly damaged at least).  


Now we see that the first order and later the final order still had enough material and manpower to build and maintain an navy. Where did these factions get their soldiers, officers and other personal from?  


Now the movies do not go into this and are happy to just spawn these men in as respawning npcs but how could this problem be approached from a logical standpoint.  


I first thought that cloning would have been a good solution. The sith have used clones before during the republic and it would not be out of character to fall back on them again but recently I had another thought.  


What if part of these stormtroopers are just, advanced, droids in stormtrooper uniforms? I think this would have made some sort of sense and be an interresting plot point giving more reason why the stormtroopers may never take of their helmets ect.","droid stormtroopers, a solution to the manpower problem?"
0,"To start off, I'm grateful we're getting this, and props to the entire team for making this happen. It's definitely better than nothing at all.

But the past two arcs have been underwhelming to an extent, and overall didn't seem to advance the story in anyway. And you see this wouldn't necessarily be a problem except we're only getting 12 episodes. You'd think the 12 we were getting would be crucial to the final points of the story.

The Bad Batch Arc was nice, we got to see Anakin and the clones again. But what exactly did it accomplish? I feel like with Echo coming back and Wat Tambor saying ""he'll make a return on his investment"" we might see something similar to Order 66, or Echo telling Rex about the chip and him removing it. But we really get nothing. The best part of all that was the Anakin and Padme scene, and the Anakin and Trench scene. But if we wanted to see dark-side Anakin Crystal Crisis would've been much better, plus we would've gotten to see a major character (General Grievous) come back.

The recent Ahsoka Arc really didn't need to be 4 episodes.  I know this has been harped on alot, and I tried to stay optimistic until it was over. But Trace literally stays the same throughout the entire arc. Rafa doesn't even seem to like Ahsoka until the final episode when she comes back to rescue her. And the Mandalorians we're teased throughout the last two episodes, didn't do anything to help them escape, and then walk in a tell Ahsoka they have a common enemy. The last 5 minutes of Episode 8 felt so rushed and weird.

Hopefully we get a scene with Dooku, Grievous, or Palpatine. It just seems weird that the 3 major villains of the series haven't been seen atleast once before ROTS.

Overall I'm enjoying Season 7, but the way some of the story is executed makes me scratch my head sometimes. Siege of Mandalore should be good tho.",I feel like Season 7 could've been executed better
0,"“He relaxed and let the force flow through him. Usually, in battle, the force seem to fall silent – not to desert him, but to become no more than instinct. This time, however, Obi-Wan found himself connecting to everything around him - as though he were in a meditative trance. He wasn’t waiting for his Master to guide him. At last, he was guided purely by the Force.

The next few minutes seem to take place in slow motion. Obi-Wan felt no fear as he emerged from behind the loader droid and re-engaged the black guards.

0,"The Plot of The Last Jedi is almost exactly the same as the plot of The Empire Strikes Back:

1. A rebel base is discovered and attacked, leading to an evacuation and escape attempt by the rebels.
2. Our main hero arrives at a distant planet to be trained by a Jedi Master.
3. The main hero leaves training early to confront their counterpart and receive a revelation about their heritage.
4. Then the main hero hooks back up with the other main characters at the end of the escape.

A film can't be truly original if it's working off an already used blueprint.

Now for the differences:

1. Rey's Jedi Master trainer is over the force/Jedi whereas vs. Yoda who is still into it.
2. There's cool interplay between Kylo and Rey during Rey's training vs. Obi Wan chimes in to encourage Yoda and Luke during his training.
3. The escape is more methodically depicted (a choice which was poorly executed in my opinion. It's kept on it's feet by having characters on both sides make braindead assumptions and decisions that no one in their positions would actually do).
4. Kylo tells Rey her Dad is nobody vs. Vader is Luke's Dad
5. The ""showdown,"" with Rey/Kylo/Snoke mimics the Return of the Jedi final showdown with Luke/Vader/The Emperor, more than the Empire Strikes back showdown.

But to me the ""original,"" elements in The Last Jedi aren't that ""original,"" because they aren't born from an original plot or place. It walks the same line as Empire, but then flips the behaviors of the characters at certain moments. This doesn't involve must more creativity that just straight up copying.

I'm not saying that The Last Jedi deserves hate for this, but it often gets praised over The Force Awakens, because people call it ""more original,"" when really it isn't. And yes, Johnson was locked into a Rey/Luke storyline because of how TFA ended, so that's not his creation, so it's not all on him.

The Force Awakens had more blatantly obvious symmetries to it's original-trilogy counterpart, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the filmmakers would own that themselves. Disney/Abrams never shied away from letting TFA be called a reboot, whereas The Last Jedi has been propped up as an original vision.","Why is TFA criticized for being a reboot, but The Last Jedi isn't?"
0,"I was reading an interesting interpretation of the chosen one in an IO9 article, discussing just who brought balance to the force and how it was done. In the article they harken back to Mortis and how Anakin didn’t stay and become the Father to maintain the balance between the Son and the Daughter. Essentially, the natural balance of the Force was broken after the Father, Son, and Daughter all died. The article comes to conclusions about how this all ties into the Force Dyad and what we got, but it gave me an idea for what might have been.

What if the ending had been Ben and Rey becoming the Son and Daughter, sacrificing their lives to return to Mortis and the natural balance of the Force. When they do, Anakin shows up to become the Father, as he was meant to, and maintain the balance.

I mean, I think it would have been more poetic if this had been done with Luke and Leia, Anakin having seen what his choice to not stay and balance the Force had wrought on his loved ones. Cursed to birth a new Force Dyad and restore the balance with his own children.

But it would work with Rey, Ben, and Anakin as well.",The Ending for the Skywalker Saga that could have tied everything together and resolved the arcs for all the main characters.

Catching up with IV-VI, I loved The Empire Strikes Back best. Didn't care much for Return of the Jedi though as the Ewoks were annoying 🙄

As for the prequel trilogy, which I've just now completed... just wow 😮

Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith were phenomenal! 🤩 The whole back story of Darth Vader was fantastic, lots of nuance, and set against the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith, and the larger political landscape, it makes his personal story one of extremely fine balance between both the light and dark within, which Hayden Christensen portrayed beautifully. It was a slow, tragic descent and painful to see not only the effects on Obi-Wan and Padmé, but also on himself 😢

I wish I could be so generous to The Phantom Menace, but unfortunately, that contained too many of the more childish elements that spoiled Return of the Jedi, and worse still, contained a lot of racial stereotyping. On a rewatch, I would just skip it altogether - the whole Anakin Skywalker story is no less for missing it out.

On to the sequel trilogy next, but this is my ranking of Episodes I to VI so far. Probably going to have unpopular opinions, but that's OK 😄

1. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
2. Episode II: Attack of the Clones
3. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
4. Episode IV: A New Hope
5. Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
6. Episode I: The Phantom Menace


Everything above 5th place is fantastic, and then there's a big gap 😕",Episodes I-VI: First Watch
0,"What is your favourite Star Wars space set piece/ space battle.
This includes the space battles as well as the abundant awesome scenes in the saga set in space.
 
Some of my favourites are:-

-)Space battle of endor(rotj) one of the most visually impressive scenes in the ot

-)Assault on death star (anh) stakes are high and everything depends on luke...and he turns off his targetting computer and relies on force. JUST AWESOME

-)Holdo's maneuver (tlj) jaw dropping thats it

-)Light speed skipping (tros) watching this in 3d makes it one of the most visually appealing scenes ever. The chemistry between poe and finn makes it really fun.

Prequel Era:

- **Dooku: Jedi Lost (audio play)**: Tells the story of Dooku's time in the Jedi Order and why he eventually left.

- **Master and Apprentice (Book)**: *Great* Novel by Claudia Gray about Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on a mission for the Jedi. Really does a lot to enhance their relationship and gives Qui-Gon a lot of character development. Any book by Claudia Gray is a must-read.

- **Dark Disciple (Book)**: This is a must-read for any Clone Wars fans. It's all about Ventress and wraps up her storyline from the show. It was originally going to be an arc before the show got canceled.

Between Episode 3 and 4:

- **Darth Vader (2017) (Comic)**: Tells the story of Vader starting the inquisitors, hunting Jedi, and getting his red Lightsaber. *Very* good comic series with Vader doing a lot of cool stuff while also expanding the lore in interesting and cool ways

- **Ahsoka (Book)**: Story about Ahsoka shortly after Order 66 as she has a run-in with the Inquisitors. Does a good job of explaining her mindset during that period and explains how she got her new lightsabers. A must-read for any Clone Wars/Rebels fans.

- **Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (Video Game)**: Set a few years after Order 66, this game tells the story of a young Jedi who suddenly gets knowledge that could help him restart the Jedi Order. Really fun game with great lore and fun gameplay.

- **new Thrawn trilogy (Books)**: Great novels about Thrawn's rise through the Empire and about the troubles he faces along the way. It also gives a lot of interesting lore about him and his people. Must-read for any Thrawn fan (Including Legends).

- **Lost Stars (Book)**: Really good young adult novel about 2 kids who live under imperial rule and details their lives as they eventually join the empire and have to deal with the horrors the empire inflicts. Does an amazing job of humanizing the imperials while not necessarily sympathizing with them (including showing how the regular soldiers felt about things like the Death Star). It also has a really nice love story.

- **Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel (Book)**: Tells the story of Jynn's parents and expands on the creation of the Death Star. I wasn't even a fan of Rogue One but I loved this novel. It does a good job of showing how the seeds of the empire started even during the Republic Era.


Between Episode 4 and 5:

- **Darth Vader (2015) (Comic)**: Tells the story of what Vader was up to after Episode 4, including his attempts to find the mysterious rebel pilot who blew up the death star. Not quite as good as the other (imo) but still fun and shows Vader being a badass. It also introduces Doctor Aphra, who's a great comic character.


Post Episode 6:

- **Bloodline (book)**: One of the most important books in New Canon (In fact, I would almost call it crucial). It tells the story of Leia's time in the New Republic Senate and reveals what people thought when they found out she was Darth Vader's daughter. More importantly, it details the rise of the First Order and explains who they are and why they do what they do.


Honorable Mentions:

- **Doctor Aphra series (Comic)**: This series had its ups and downs and, while I liked most of it, I didn't like it enough to recommend it. If you really like Aphra in the 2015 Vader series, then read this.

- **Darth Vader (2020) (Comic)**: This has been great so far but it's only been 2 issues so I don't feel comfortable recommending it yet.

- **Rise of Kylor Ren (Comic)**: This series had some good moments, but it felt a little rushed. What we got was good, but I feel like it needed to be longer for me to feel comfortable recommending it. If you're interested in how Kylo fell to the Dark Side and met the Knights of Ren, this is the book for you.

- **Darth Vader: Lords of the Sith (Book)**: This was fun to listen to on audiobook...but that's because I could skip through the boring parts. It has a lot of really cool lore about the sith and Vader's feelings during the OT era, but I can't recommend it as a whole. If you're interested in Vader lore, I suggest checking it out.

0,"So with the Sequel Trilogy now all said and done (and the varying reactions that accompanied it), I guess people are now going to want to start thinking about doing entire Star Wars marathons.

The first choice would be just to do a straight run from Episode I-IV, but as anyone who's used the original Machete Order will attest this can be a lengthy process and doesn't tie the themes and story as nicely together as the MO does. 

So that got me thinking, now that the new trilogy is out, what about extending the MO to include the final three movies? I know that a lot of fans are unhappy with how they turned out, myself included, but perhaps a change of viewing order could help integrate them better into rest of the Star Wars saga. Hear me out.

The order would be like this, in keeping with the original MO of starting at a later episode and jumping back to get the backstory: 

- Episode VII - TFA
- Episode VIII - TLJ
- Episode IV - ANH
- Episode V - TESB
- Episode II - AOTC
- Episode III - ROTS
- Episode VI - ROTJ
- Episode IV - TROS

Think about it. 

You start out with the New Republic, the First Order, Rey, Finn, Kylo, Maz, etc. and see that the Galaxy is in turmoil. Kylo, the grandson of the legendary Sith Lord Darth Vader, is on his destructive rampages, and to oppose him, Rey goes to study under the tutelage of the legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker, only to find out he's a disheveled old man with no interest in helping anyone. 

Just as he redeems himself at the end of TLJ, we jump back to see the origins of *his* story - how he joined the Rebellion, studied under Obi-Wan and Yoda, and found out the evil Darth Vader was none other than his father, Anakin Skywalker. 

Then, we jump back *again*, to see Anakin's origin story, about how he was a promising young Jedi during the Clone Wars, how he fell in love with Padme, and wanted nothing more than to keep her alive and be faithful to the Jedi Order.

Finally, we end up on a ""trilogy of finales"" - first we see Anakin succumb to the Dark Side out of fear of losing Padme, and he drags down the Republic, the Jedi Order and democracy with him, leading to the Empire and the rise of Palpatine. Then straight after, we see Luke, in his final confrontation with the Empire, both redeem his father and defeat Palpatine, leading to the birth of the New Republic and the resurrection of the Jedi Order. Then finally, at the end of everything, we see Rey learn of her heritage, Luke and Leia give Rey the final words of wisdom she needs to confront Kylo and Palpatine, Kylo ultimately turn away from evil and leave the Dark Side, and then Rey - and all the Jedi - take down Palpatine - and all the Sith - once and for all. She ends up burying Anakin's lightsabre on Tatooine, where both Anakin and Luke were from, receiving the approving looks of Luke and Leia, before reclaiming the Skywalker legacy and looking into the sunset. 

In this order Episode I is again unnecessary, since it doesn't really add crucial information about anything other than a couple of throwaway lines in Episode II. Also, this way the story is presented as the Rise, Fall, Resurrection and final defeat of the Dark Side of in the galaxy, as well as being the ultimate destruction of Palpatine and his menace. 

What do you guys think? I'm tempted to get Disney+ just to view all of this at once and see how it goes. I still have my issues with the movies but I think this could make them a lot more compelling to watch. Thoughts?",Machete-Machete Order?
0,"Personally, Kylo Ren was probably my favorite character we got from this Sequel Trilogy (or at least the first two films). That said, I always felt like there was so much more to his backstory. I understand that it has been recently explored in the comics, but I feel like it's also worthy tale to have told on screen.

Imagine this: what if *The Force Awakens* started a little earlier? Maybe one storyline in the film could've been Luke's training with Ben. Throughout the movie, we could slowly see he and Luke beginning to drift apart, and Ben's fascination with the Dark Side increasing. The film could've ended with him abandoning the Jedi code, embracing the darkness, and becoming Kylo Ren. That would've been some amazing character development to see not only for Ben, but for Luke, as well.

I know that the Sequel Trilogy is done and it's probably best to move on. But I can't help but wonder what could've been. Regardless, what are your thoughts on this? I'd love to hear what you all have to say.",Would any of you have been interested to see Ben's fall to the Dark Side in the trilogy?
0,"I tried googling but most results came up talking about prequels or OT. Or just from episode 9. 

I'm sure it's been discussed, if anyone knows a good link to read that'd be helpful. 

Current things I'm unclear about are 

1) What was his plan in episode 6, because apparently he transferred his consciousness (or cloned I assume since he was still conscious in his last scenes) before the last fight. 

2) What is his ultimate plan in episodes 7-9. Is he hoping Snoke dies at the hands of rey/kylo? 

3) He tells kylo to kill rey at the beginning of episode 9. What happens if he succeeds, does he then possess Kylo somehow? 

4) If his final plan involved Rey, he was then somehow hoping that his clone son makes a son/daughter as well? All in the hopes that he can possess him/her?",Spoilers. What exactly was palpatines plan around episode 6 to 9?
0,"The more I watch I feel the more I like Ahsoka above most of the other characters. Sure we have Kenobi (also a favorite), Luke, Yoda, Plo Koon (I just liked his look as a kid and liked him even more when they flesh out his character) but I just feel she is still above the rest. 

First, let me just say I think she’s hands down one of the most badass characters. She survived an encounter with Grievous (TWICE), something several Jedi across different levels of mastery were unable to do. She also stood toe-to-toe with Ventress, hive mind Barris, fought pretty decently against Anakin (Mortis), survives Pre Vizla (even almost beating him), what I can only assume is a fight against Maul which will be cut short, kills an Inquisitor, beats a few more, and then gives VADER a run for his money. She’s also a Clone Wars war hero who performs several outstanding acts throughout: tough fights, saving senator from assassination, protecting younglings, fighting pirates, leading rebels to victory. Oh yea, and she’s only 14-17 throughout her first war. 

Second, she reaches a level of attunement with the Force that we rarely see. She is hinted as still being alive around the time of Ep. 9 and she telepathically communicates with Rey. She’s also purified 2 kyber crystals, something that isn’t really touched upon but seems difficult. And she’s very centered and pretty much the ideal Jedi by the end of her Rebels story. She even goes by Ashla (if I remember right) during her exile, which is later defined as a term for the Force itself. 

Third, she’s just a very well fleshed out character. I think part of the reason I like the character is that it seems to contain the better parts of Anakin and a lot of wisdom. We get to see a full character arc and outcome that gets fleshed out in a book and two series. I feel Rey had potential, but creative differences really soured it in the 8-9 time gap. I also feel like Luke is a GREAT character but gets kind of tarnished a bit because of his depiction in TLJ. I like the movie and depiction of him as a broken man, but we don’t really ever get the development that led him to think of killing his own nephew and abandoning his role. Anakin is obviously a contender, but he has his flaws. If there’s 2 comparable characters to their story and how they got there I feel like Kenobi and Maul are the next two in line.

TL;DR: Ahsoka has a great narrative and character build that make her a favorite character. On the level of Maul and Kenobi in terms of stories and likability. Also she’s just a very strong Jedi and a blend of the better parts of other characters while still unique in her own right. Also Plo Koon is cool.

Sorry this is a long post I just really appreciate the time and effort Lucas, Filoni, and the rest of the LucasFilm team but into making Ahsoka’s character.",Ahsoka
0,"So i recently watched star wars the clone wars and im currently at season 3

I kbow that in season 1 ziro escaped from prison with the help of cat bane and his crew (you can see aurra sing in his crew clearly, thats the point)

After all u can clearly see in the assasination episode that sings tries to kill padme, she fails because asoka interrupts her, after that u can see ziro in prison CLEARLY

So the escape of ziro in season 1 happens AFTER the events of assasination and after boba and sings mission kill windu

But i dont understand how sing can be in banes crew when she lost the fight against asoka, she had to be arrested after this episode, acctualy u can see her how she helps bane (nothing is mentioned about her in that episode btw not from anakin or from asoka this makes no sense at all)

0,"Before you attack me, hear me out. I'm not asking if the prequels should be re written, filmed with better actors or anything. Possibly my biggest problem with the trilogy is it's outdated CGI and overuse of it in Episodes II and III. Whilst there obviously can't be a change to how much was used, it can be updated. Since they have the money, Disney could easily do a ""remaster"" if you will, for the effects in the films. And whilst they're at it, they could also do extended versions. I for one, would love to see Episode III in it's 4 hour version, even if a lot of that content is in The Clone Wars. And as long as the original versions are still available, what harm could it do? (A lesson that George Lucas should have learned.)

TL;DR: The prequels would benefit from better CGI.",Should the prequels be remade?
0,"Thought it was alright. 5/10. Average overall. 

Firstly the writing and continuity is just trash. But that ground work was set long ago in TFA, and also by TLJ having a different director with a vision that clashed with the other director. So the writing is whatever. Like, I'm pretty sure Palpatine had no mention in the previous two films and now here his name just pops up in the scroll? Like what? But again.... whatever.

Where this movie shines is the visuals. It looks pretty damn good. Lovely film grain. Lots of different enivornments. Lots of big vista shots. It's pretty alright. One of the best looking sw films for sure. 

Secondly, a lot of the humour here actually landed for me. I found most of the humour in the previous 2 films kinda cringe but here I actually laughed quite a few times. So props there. 

But then another downside the whole final quarter (or whatever) of the film - the attack on exicil. I felt this wasn't great. Just kinda standard stuff but since it tries to wrap up story elements and, once again, these sequels have godawful writing, then it kinda fails there. And once again the big bad dies wayy to easy. Just like snoke. I mean snokes death was just idioitic with that ""I know EVERYTHING!"" speech and then immediately being blind sided. And now ehre the Emporer shoots about actual sized lightening bolt from his hands and decimates the sky and then he gets undone by someone simply holding a lightsaber? Pathetic. 

All in all I think it's the best of the sequels. I liked that the trio spent time together on adventures, unlike TLJ where they were all split up. TFA was just action set piece after action set piece. I hate that film.

OVerall I don't really count these films as canon tbh. I'm glad they are finished.

Oh and one more thing: How many  times did Abrams do that ""push in"" move with the camera? Goodness he is not a good director.

0,"Something I don't remember seeing much of at all was the timeframe between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I do remember a great deal of exploration of Qui-Gon and his training of Obi-Wan, but I only ever remember a single piece of media involving Padawan Anakin pre-Clone Wars - a cameo appearance in a comic miniseries focused on Jedi Masters doing... something. All I remember is A) Windu and several other masters go to Nar Shadaa, B) while on Nar Shadaa, they encounter a woman who claims her daughter was taken in by the order, and C) a cameo appearance by Padawan Anakin when Ki-Adi-Mundi (I think) sees him chatting away with the half-Tusken padawan A'sharad Hett, Anakin expressing to the master something along the lines of ""I thought all Tuskens were bad people, but this guy's alright"" or somesuch (which, after AoTC, is pretty ""oof"" in hindsight).

Also Racer's Revenge, but I don't even know if that's even part of Legends canon.

I'm sure there was something more, but it just surprises me how little focus that particular timeframe got even at the time - and as for afterwards, all focus (understandably) shifted towards the Clone Wars.

0,"so when the last jedi came out, i loved it (and i still do). i remember saying to my friend when we walked out of the theater ‘that was everything i could’ve asked for from a sequel to TFA.’ i went online and was baffled to see so much negative reception and disappointment, i really didn’t get it. in fact it kind of pissed me off, the way anybody who liked TLJ was shot down or dismissed; there’s so much to love about that movie and i was upset that people couldn’t see that.

ENTER TROS. i was scared going into the theater bc i worried the movie couldn’t possibly live up to the first two for me. from the opening crawl i was apprehensive and as the movie went on i became more and more disappointed with the direction it was going and the storytelling choices it made. by the time the last battle came around i was tearing up because i felt NOTHING—here’s the climax i’ve waited three years to see and i don’t even care what happens. the final scene to me was like the cherry on top—i stood up to walk out before JJ’s name even came up. i was angry. i felt jaded. i felt like something I loved had just been ‘ruined’.

so i guess my point is i get it now. the way people were reacting to TLJ is almost the exact reaction I had to TROS. i’d like to apologize to everyone i vehemently defended TLJ to when probably all they wanted to do was rant and vent their frustration. we all like different stuff and to say someone’s wrong for liking or disliking something is invalidating how they felt about it. people have talked over my complaints about TROS and now i realize what people who disliked TLJ went through after that film.

also, i’m just sorry in general to all of us that we didn’t get a better more cohesive trilogy. it sucks to get SO excited about something and have it let you down completely.",an apology
0,"Now I’ve fully enjoyed all SW movies with the exception of AOTC, but that wasn’t what this post is about. Looking back on it, I think the best Star Wars movie released post-OT is ROTS. There’s so many good scenes in this movie. I mean right off the bat it starts off super entertaining with count dooku being killed, and then soon after they foreshadow Anakins inevitable demise with him and palpatine talking and palpatine saying how one must understand all sides of the force. That right there set the tone for the entire movie and kept me hooked the whole time. I think personally my favorite part is the ending after palpatine executes order 66. So much tension after that. Anakin going to the dark and slaughtering all the innocent people, shocking padme and showing he’s never going back. And then one of my favorite fights, not just in the movie but the entire franchise, with obi vs anakin. So many great moments and, imo, a great ending to an otherwise mixed trilogy.

I’d love to see Luke Skywalker at his most powerful teaching a new generation of Jedi and what Ben did to make him contemplate killing him as he nearly did Vader all those years ago (Perhaps killing and covering up the death of one of his other students with his life being threatened otherwise?).

We could also learn more about Snoke and Palpatines resurrection through cloning and Sith alchemy,maybe establishing how force users can only attempt it once through the dark side with the risk of coming out mangled and weak like he did.

I’d also like to find out how Luke became aware of the two and the existence of Rey since he hinted he knew about her existence and lineage in TROS.Him and Ben communicating with Obi Wan and Anakin until Luke quit and Palpatine corrupted Ben through the voice of Vader would be sweet as well.

Everyone else would be original characters besides the students who have already been established in the comics and we could see the factions that stayed with Luke and the ones who became Knights of Ren leading to their clash that killed the remaining Jedi.

They wouldn’t have to explain away Han,Lando and Leia not being there since it’s at his Jedi training area but could still allow for their appearances if it’s a cartoon or for Chewy and Threepio to be there regardless of the medium if they want.

0,"Hi I've been bored in quarantine and thought up an alternate way the sequel trilogy could've went. Feel free to add to it or comment or whatever  

  

The Force Awakens takes place on only one planet. It's a lush green planet and home to a society of priests and priestesses (clean, minimalist, white and yellow aesthetic and buildings, they're very rich because of a rare mineral found on that planet) and it begins with scenes of a young child training with a stick and meditating, called Rey. She's shown to be talkative around other students (but was always an independent girl) and stubbornly does what she thinks is right. She grew up on tales about Luke Skywalker, who has been gaining a lot of reputation in the galaxy, so she's also very idealistic. She also reads a lot about space battles, adventurers and the like.  

  

The First Order is not like the Empire, but more like a group of people trying to recreate what the Empire was through desperate force. Finn is a stormtrooper with a moral compass, and he's sent with a group to Rey's planet to attack the priest order, they got intel that they might be hiding Luke Skywalker there. They travel on a ship, Finn and an other character get into a fight (they had beef in the past) and Finn gets thrown off of the ship by them. He barely survives, wanders around and finds a group of priests who nurse him back to health, then administer Rey to watch over him. They bond, but Finn does not tell her he's a stormtrooper who wants out of the First Order. Neither of them are aware that Rey is force sensitive, but there are subtle clues.  

  

Han Solo comes into the picture, smuggling supplies to the priests. Before landing with the Falcon, he has an emotional talk with Leia, which feels like goodbye (he makes a remark how their hologram conversations always feel like they're gonna be the last). What he, and others don't know is that the leaders of these priests are conducting illegal experiments on a certain alien species' children (who are being smuggled onto the planet by people like Han, although Han himself doesn't do that). Their aim is to artificially make people Force sensitive and get powers.  

  

Han immeaditely spots how out of place Finn looks amongst the people (no white and golden robes, wounded and confused looking), and strikes up a conversation with him over a drink, at the local bar. Meanwhile, Rey's force sensitivity has been getting stronger lately, and she notices weird patterns that she hasn't before. She also senses the pain of the alien children, and knows something isn't right. She joins Han and Finn at the bar.  

  

The second half starts with the priest society now under attack by Finn's former team. Finn is not the best at aiming but he does know how to handle a gun which makes Rey suspicious. He tells her he used to be a Stormtrooper because now she's a friend of his (and he has a crush on her). They beat Finn's team, Finn shoots the guy who threw him off the ship, but one of the stormtroopers makes a distress call towards the First Order. A bigger ship will arrive soon.  

  

Rey has a conversation with Han about how Finn can't be trusted. Han agrees and reinforces this idea as he had bad experiences with the Empire before. Rey and Han help the priests to come up with a defense plan (not involving Finn in the process). They beat the First Order ship, and in a dangerous situation Rey and Finn are forced to cooperate, saving each others' lives.  

  

Towards the end, Han accidentally finds out the twist about the priest order, and is murdered by the leader. Rey feels a piercing pain in her chest due to the disturbance in the Force, while they're hanging out with Finn, he gets scared but then she starts walking towards where the leader is, and discovers what he's been doing. The final villain is the priest leader who almost kills Finn but Rey saves him at the end. Finn makes a move on Rey later, which Rey declines but they are now trusted friends.  

  

They free the alien children they find, and quickly make their way to the Falcon, where they find a sedated Chewbacca and a couple of priests watching over him. They fight, Chewbacca then wakes up, learns the news of Han's death and is devastated.  

  

Rey, not knowing what to do or where to go, antagonized by her people (and the same goes for Finn, they relate), goes to search for Luke Skywalker, her childhood hero. When she arrives at the island, with the children, she finds Luke and Luke's pilot and helper, a young man called Poe Dameron.  

  

Rey's development in this first movie is about how her views on the world are challenged, with her people committing such horrible deeds and a stormtrooper (a group Rey has only known as evil people) leaving the First Order behind for the right cause. Finn is a bit similar to the original, and Poe has only a cameo at the end.",An alternate sequel trilogy just for fun part 1

I understand this is mostly because the movies were there before the show but do you all think this is a continuity error or is simply an intentional part of Anakin's personality that is further meant to highlight his arrogance and short sightedness. I personally think this was considered before they finished that arc during the show and meant it to highlight how blinded Anakin was by his own hatred and anger during Episode III. I personally havent seen season 7 of the Clone Wars if there are any spoilers involved please leave it out of this discussion.,Anakin's visions didnt seem to have any effect.
0,"I always thought Ahsoka’s original role in The Clone Wars show was awesome throughout the entirety of the first 6 seasons, mostly costarring with Obi &amp; Anakin  and occasionally getting her own episodes here and there. Then Rebels came along and I loved the show but not as much as Clone Wars so having the Ahsoka tie in was a cool nod to Clone Wars and made me more open to the show. 

Now the majority of the final season of Clone Wars is focused on her...she’s confirmed for Season 2 of The Mandolorian, and apparently Rosario’s contract is a multi-show deal so its likely she could appear in Kenobi or other Disney+ SW shows. Spit balling but whatever. And of course there’s the Rebels continuation series whenever that show is ready. But the character is so overdone at this point it’s really irritating to see her soak up the majority of the screen time in this final season of clone wars. Was really hoping to see more of Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin, along with the rest of the Jedi Council in there final days. 

Sorry for the unpopular opinion and thanks for letting me vent. Lol!",Unpopular Opinion: Ahsoka is overrated.

___

Power in the Star Wars universe has been the subject of debate between fans for decades. ""Well, Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber, so he is obviously more powerful than Obi-Wan Kenobi!"" ""Yoda is the best Force user in the galaxy, he would destroy anyone else!"" Now, I present to you a fresh perspective: how Jedi hair length affects their power. Does being bald make you a better Jedi? Or having long, beautiful locks? Read on to find out.

___

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell). If I missed a couple, I apologize, please don't burn me at the stake.

**Methodology:**

There are two main data points used in this analysis: 1) hair length and 2) power level. Hair length is easy to break down: bald, short, medium, and long lengths of hair. Power level is a little more complex. It is a weighted average score based on four factors: 1) wisdom, 2) combat ability, 3) leadership, and 4) lightsaber awesomeness. Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.

___

##Table 1: Power Level Weighted Averages

This table is extremely wide, so I only included a piece of it for you to view. All power levels can be viewed in the next table. Power levels and criteria are ranked 1 - 5, with 1 being terrible and 5 being amazing.




Power Criteria | Weight | Qui-Gon Jinn | Obi-Wan Kenobi | Anakin Skywalker | Quinlan Vos | Yoda
--------------|------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|----
Wisdom | 25% | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 5
Combat Ability | 25% | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5
Leadership | 25% | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5
Lightsaber Awesomeness | 25% | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4
Weighted Average Score | 100% | 4 | 4.25 | 4 | 3.5 | 4.75

___

##Table 2: Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows both hair length and power levels (in descending order). Hair falls under this definition: ""any of the fine threadlike strands growing from the skin of humans, mammals, and some other animals."" Any Jedi of a species that looks like they have hair (such as Ahsoka Tano), but doesn't fall under the definition of hair, is classified as bald.

|Jedi Name|Hair Length|Power Score|
:--|:--|--:|
|Mace Windu|Bald|4.75|
|Yoda|Short|4.75|
|Count Dooku|Short|4.5|
|Tera Sinube|Long|4.25|
|Can Drallig|Long|4.25|
|Luke Skywalker|Medium|4.25|
|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Short|4.25|
|Plo Koon|Bald|4|
|Qui-Gon Jinn|Long|4|
|Anakin Skywalker|Medium|4|
|Kanan Jarrus|Medium|4|
|Yarael Poof|Bald|3.75|
|Asajj Ventress|Bald|3.75|
|Shaak Ti|Bald|3.5|
|Ahsoka Tano|Bald|3.5|
|Ima-Gun Di|Bald|3.5|

|Tiplee|Long|3.5|
|Adi Gallia|Medium|3.5|
|Stass Allie|Medium|3.5|
|Ezra Bridger|Medium|3.5|
|Luminara Unduli|Short|3.5|
|Saesee Tiin|Bald|3.25|
|Kit Fisto|Bald|3.25|
|Aayla Secura|Bald|3.25|
|Rey|Long|3.25|
|Jocasta Nu|Medium|3.25|
|Sifo-Dyas|Medium|3.25|
|Ki-Adi-Mundi|Short|3.25|
|Coleman Trebor|Bald|3|
|Bolla Ropal|Bald|3|
|Finn Ertay|Bald|3|
|Coleman Kcaj|Bald|3|
|Depa Billaba|Medium|3|
|Ben Solo|Medium|3|
|Ky Narec|Short|3|
|Pablo-Jill|Bald|2.75|
|Halsey|Bald|2.75|
|Eekar Oki|Bald|2.75|
|Pong Krell|Bald|2.75|
|Eeth Koth|Long|2.75|
|Agen Kolar|Long|2.75|
|Rig Nema|Bald|2.5|
|Nahdar Vebb|Bald|2.25|
|Zett Jukassa|Short|2.25|
|Tutso Mara|Short|2.25|
|Ord Enisence|Bald|2|
|Barris Offee|Medium|2|
|Knox|Bald|1.75|

___

##Table 3: Correlation Between Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Hair Length|Average of Power Level|
:--|--:|
|Bald|3.11|
|Short|3.47|
|Medium|3.39|
|Long|3.52|

___

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

___",Saved by the Gel: Examining How Jedi Hair Length Affects Their Power
0,"VERY rough outline/idea. But I feel this would’ve been deeper and more substantive, add more to her character, and not feel like filler until the Mandalore arc.

After Ahsoka left the Order, she set off to find herself. She thinks she really needs to get as far away from the Jedi as possible, give herself space and time to think. After some time, she decides to go back to her homeworld of Shilli where she was born and where Master Plo found her. She finds her family, the one from which she was taken all those years ago, and we get to see how she and her family deal with their reunion. 

We get to see how taking force sensitive children affects families. Maybe, since Ahsoka was always on the frontlines with the poster boys of the Republic’s war effort (Anakin and Obi-Wan) despite being a child, we could see her families regret of giving her up and their resentment of the Jedi for taking her and “turning her into a child soldier, (along with their clone slaves).”

We really get to reckon with these parts of Jedi philosophy, and this builds up even more reason to believe the Jedi aren’t as great as they seem to be, all high &amp; mighty, taking children from families with little regard for how that can affect everyone. This gives more reason to believe the people of the galaxy would turn on the Jedi as we get closer to Episode III.

Eventually, despite loving her family, she gets tangled up with some crime that she traces back to Coruscant and decides she can’t live a normal life anymore. After everything she’s gone through, and everything she’s been taught, it’s too hard for her to let bad things happen knowing she has the power (more than most) to help stop those things... plus, maybe she misses action more than she thought she would.

So, she departs back to Coruscant. 

There, living in the lower levels, she really gets to see how bad things are even on the capital planet of the Republic! 

She sees how the distraction of the war has preoccupied the Jedi from taking care of things back home, and she sees just how deep corruption runs through Coruscant and the Republic as a whole, and how much of it stems from the Underworld. 

She decides to become a vigilante, working to take down crime syndicates and save innocent lives. She’s found who she is again, a peacekeeper and someone who fights for justice and for the little guy. This takes her into conflict with the Pyke Syndicate and other cartels. From there, she deduces their connection to Maul on Mandalore. She meets Bo Katan and agrees to help them take on Maul.

And that’s how we get to the Mandalore Arc.

We see how public opinion turns on the Jedi, we see how some families handle losing their children to the Jedi, we get more of the criminal underworld, and perhaps more importantly for Ahsoka as a character - We get to see Ahsoka deal with some awful tenants of the Jedi Order, which informs the rest of her life and leads to the confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader in which she so famously proclaims... “I’m no Jedi.”

Anyways, that’s just how I envisioned the continuation of her story. I still like parts of what we did end up getting, but it feels rather slow, pretty inconsequential/meaningless (especially since we’re really not gonna see Trace and Rafa ever and so much time was spent on them nonetheless), and not very deep or substantive for Ahsoka’s character.",An idea of what Ahsoka’s Season 7 arc could’ve been.
0,"The Chosen One prophecy states that

&gt;""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.""

Many people see Anakin's act of killing Palpatine in ROTJ as the ultimate balance in the Force being restored. But Palpatine comes back in TROS and dies by Rey's hand, so that must make Rey the Chosen One, right? Not exactly.

For starters, **Rey cannot be the Chosen One because she had a father.** It doesn't matter whether you consider him a ""nobody"" like Kylo did in TLJ, we know he exists, we know he's a clone of Palpatine, we've seen him in flashbacks in TROS, so that already rules Rey out for this aspect of the prophecy. Luke is similarly ruled out - his father is, of course, Anakin. (Another case could be made that the prophecy specifies a male Chosen One, but that could really just be chalked up to gender-neutral language.)

So why do I still believe that Anakin is the Chosen One? The prophecy states that **""through [the Chosen One] will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.**"" Even if the final defeat of the Sith was in 35ABY in Exegol, 31 years after Anakin's death, can it not be said that ""through Anakin"", ultimate balance in the Force was restored? After all, almost all of Anakin's actions and decisions in the Prequel and Original Trilogies wind up directly impacting the Sequel Trilogy. In TLJ, Rey mentions Anakin's redemption to Luke and compares him to Ben; had Anakin not turned to the Light Side it's unlikely she would have been so convinced that Ben could be turned if he hadn't. (Also, Luke might've probably been dead, but you get my point.) Ben's entire motivation hinges upon trying to emulate his grandfather, and realising that he ultimately wasn't. Luke's failure between the Original and Sequel Trilogies stemmed fron his fear that Ben was going to become another Vader. This is why I get slightly annoyed when people say that the Sequels aren't about Anakin's legacy because Anakin never appeared as a Force Ghost - he may not have appeared, but his presence is deeply felt.

Furthermore, I've always taken the Skywalker Saga as a mythic tale (after all, Lucas based Luke off of Joseph Campbell's monomythic ""Hero of a Thousand Faces""). And one thing about prophecies in ancient mythology like Greek and Roman ones is that prophecies usually hinge upon wordplay and double-meanings, in that they usually never mean exactly what they say. Due to this, I'm far more inclined to take the ""through him"" aspect of the prophecy far less literally, and more in how Anakin's actions impacted his family and those around them in order to end the Sith.

In short, Anakin's actions basically set the stage for the complete and final destruction of the Sith in Exegol - Luke, Leia, Rey and Ben all being part of this aspect of the prophecy in how many of their actions and decisions were directly as a result of Anakin's deeds and his legacy. The way I see it, the Skywalker Saga (Episodes I-IX) basically tell the story of the Chosen One and the final defeat of the Sith, just that it took 67 years and 3 wars for it to finally end.

Of course, all of this is merely my interpretation of things. If you disagree, that's absolutely fine. Just try not to be an asshole about it.","I firmly believe that in spite of some recent comments, Anakin is still the Chosen One, and you CAN reconcile the Sequel Trilogy with this. Here's why:"
0,"I don't watch Star Wars film to analyse plot details and expect an incredible Oscar-winning story, but at times there are certainly things that could have been done better. One issue I had with TRoS, is how at no real point was I ever expecting any of the main characters to bite the dust. The last film in saga is always going to have a happy ending and I knew this, but that moment when the entire cinema thought that Rey had just accidentally killed Chewie? Good lord I was honestly so shocked. But I did kind of feel cheated with the fake out.

To make the story of Rey's potential turn to the dark actually seem plausible, killing Chewie off here would have absolutely been a brilliant way to begin that subplot. They killed off Han in TFA, (probably should've killed off Leia in TLJ but that's another topic) so why not kill Chewie here? I love that Wookie but killing off another fan favourite like this would have been a seriously impressive move from the filmmakers for me.",Popular/Unpopular Opinion: Rey should have killed Chewbacca on Pasaana
0,"Looking at the sequel trilogy now I feel the actors did a good job (Adam Driver is superb) and thought the cinematography and the visuals they created were excellent. However the story was utter horseshit. If the studio had the balls to let one director/writing team to see through a complete vision we would have 3 complete trilogies, not just 2. The EU before Mickey came along has so much great material to work with. Imagine a trilogy with Grand Admiral Thrawn as the main antagonist. Oh what could have been...",This is probably going to get downvoted to hell but I feel it’s worth saying...
0,"I know the movie is considered one of the weakest ( than again I don’t know how you can say it’s worse than TLJ OR ROS)

I know the romance part was pretty cringe worthy and had awful dialogue. But I understood why Lucas wanted to have this as a focus.  It set the stage for Anakins downfall really well.  Showing him seeing visions of his mother dying and it turning out to be true and the Tuskegee raider slaughtering.  They needed to show how much Anakin loved padme so his turn to the dark side over saving her is more dramatic and he wasn’t just some desperate dude who falls in love quick .


Obi wans whole storyline and investigating the clone troopers was great.  Ewan’s Obi wan is the MVP in general of the prequels and I feel
This is where he really stood out was in this movie

The fight scene with Jango Fett and the scene before that where Obi wan is questioning him.  Just awesome.  Lucas was able to
Make a fight scene with a Jedi and a bounty hunter with no lightsaber incredibly entertaining .

Count dooku was great and his battle with Anakin and Obi wan was awesome 

I know we didn’t get a lot of it.  But when we see
The clone army appear and the battle on genosis was just epic.  Wish we saw more of that on the big screen .",Unpopular Opinion: I really enjoyed AOTC and it’s my favorite prequel movie
0,"I started playing Battlefront 2 again recently because of all the praise it's been getting and how ""Dice totally improved it"" and ""it's a completely different game now"". I have to say I'm having a blast playing especially now I'm in self quarantine. For anyone that hasn't given it a shot I plead you to do so, Dice really deserves the money and support for making the game this dramatically better since launch.

However, one awesome thing I've noticed upon joining the Battlefront subreddit, following Insta pages and the devs Twitter accounts is how calm and collective everyone is. For comparison just take a look a subreddits like r/saltierthancrait or r/saltierthankrayt, both full of people circle-jerking over what they hate. Then there's the meme communities which are pretty tame as it's mostly just joking around but in the Battlefront community all you see is calm and honest discussion and showing appreciation for one another. I actually saw a prequel lover and a sequel lover discuss their differences and then ask for each others usernames to play, it's unreal sometimes.

So if you're torn on the content autistic screeching of most Star Wars communities I urge you to be a part of Battlefront, it's a breath of fresh air in a current world where opinions have right and wrong answers.",I think we can all agree that the Battlefront 2 community are probably the most civilised of all Star Wars fans
0,"So I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning. 1977. And only today was I thinking about this:

Does Leia know that she's adopted? I mean IN the original trilogy when Luke tells her they are brother and sister... is she just realizing that she's adopted? It's not mentioned in any of the original films and obviously Lucas didn't have certain things in mind from the beginning. In A New Hope she's just the princess, in Empire there's the kiss between her and Luke so even then she wasn't intended to be his sister.

I say this because I have a theory that fixes the hole/contradiction when she mentions remembering her mother. People call it a flaw because of Padme dying at childbirth. And Luke saying, ""Your REAL mother..."" should give a person pause (like why did you just say ""real""?) but what if she didn't know she was adopted and her ""real"" mother, aka Bail Organa's wife, died when she was young? Maybe he remarried and she was talking about her birth mother? I assume part of keeping the Skywalkers hidded might include NOT telling them the truth.

I mean, Luke doesn't remember his mother so how and why would he ask Leia if she did if they're twins?

Am I missing something? I know there have been countless books and retcons but in 1983 that scene and dialogue is not problematic at all.",Leia theory/question from Return of the Jedi
0,"I do like the idea of bio organic tech and a species that despises droids, and even intergalatic threats. What I don't care for is the extra galactic beings that have no imprint in the Force, something that doesn't seem like it would be restricted to one galaxy. The Ysalamiri are one thing, they evolved the ability to produce a bubble that negates the force to protect themselves from force sensitive predators, but the Yuuzhan Vong are 'absent' in the Force for no real reason. And basically all Force abilities don't effect them. Oh and the adding them into the past, like Canderous's experience. And spacers aren't tight lipped about strange experiences. That feels weird outside the unknown regions. They seem almost over powered...the force immunity is a big thing though...","This might be a controversial opinion, but I am glad that the Yuuzhan Vong are no longer canon."
0,"So I was looking at the character art and bio's again and I don't know why I didn't realize this before or why I haven't seen anyone mention it. But with Vernestra being knighted when she is 16 that means she didn't spend all that long as a Padawan.

Most Jedi are taken as padawans when they are 12 with some being taken as early as eleven and thirteen being seen as being old (Obiwan was taken as a padawan when he was 13 and knighted at 23).

This means that if she was taken at the youngest age group of 11 to be trained by her master that would mean she was a padawan for 5 years.

Now this is being treated as something special and unique that happened to her. TCW mentioned how odd it was to make a teen a knight (you know when they tried to bribe Ahsoka with knighthood. Anakin was knighted at 19 and that was remarked as being unusually young) let alone one as young as Ahsoka. And we know from characters like Barris and Mayze Raynshi that they age like humans do so this isn't a baby yoda situation.

So I'm now even more interesting in what could have happened that would cause her to be put up for promotion to knighthood at such a young age and after so few years partnered with her master.",I just realized that the main character in High Republic: A Test of Courage has only been a padawan for at most five years before being knighted

2) EA signing for a KOTOR Remake, done in a similar vain as Fallen Order but character creation  
3) A new movie set during the Prequel era with most of the original cast, but tangential to III's plot and more character focused.",My Unlikely Wishlist
0,"So, as almost everyone I have decided that the best way to entertain myself during the quarantine is by undergoing a Star Wars marathon.

Today I was watching episode 2 after having watched the first yesterday, and I was wondering why the droid army in the first episode is under the control of the trade federation.

Isn’t it property of the separatists?

I know well that the separatists appear in the second but still I can’t quite grasp this whole matter.

I have come up with a couple of explanations and I would like to know what you think.

A) The droid army is an asset of the trade federation and it is dedicated to the separatist cause when the treaty on Geonosis is signed.

B) The droid army is in reality property of the sith and the trade federation is just helped by that very same army in occasion of the invasion of Naboo. In the first episode we can clearly see the Viceroy obeying to Dart Sidious.

A, B or something else?","I have a doubt, can you help me figure it out??"
0,"So with the developments in the latest Clone Wars episode, is it possible that they could be bringing together Clone Wars, Rebels and The Mandalorian storylines? 

I don’t see anything in rules directly relating to spoilers for Clone Wars but I’ll be as vague as I can be in an attempt to not spoil it. If you are totally against any hints at all about CW’s latest ep then stop reading now. 

My theory is that the current CW episodes are foreshadowing some sort of story mechanism to tie into Mando in one way. That is yet tbd but I think we can see paths that could happen. Given that they’ve cast an adult Ahsoka for Mando, I could see Sabine and Ahsoka while looking for Ezra running into Mando in some capacity. 

I’m curious to hear others takes on this, if it’s been discussed already please point me towards that link. I have some loose details around it all, so I’d love to look through others takes on how it could all go down or how you’d like to see it happen.",Star Wars TV Series Fan Theory
0,"Ok for English every Friday we would not do work a read a book of your choice and then at the end of the marking period we would have a project due on it. I picked A New Dawn for my book and now we are doing the project we were supposed to do it a few week ago but with everything that’s goin on it was pushed back. 

But anyways part of the project is we have to pick 3-5 themes that go on throughout the book and explain them. So far I have evil, and fate. Evil goes with out saying for the people who have read it. And fate because it’s like the conversation Kanan and Hera had in season for with they were meant to meet Ezra and be on lothal. In the beginning of the book Kanan and Hera had a few chances to meet but they didn’t, and even when the first time they meet and Hera chooses to just leave on the spot. It just happens to be the cantina she was meeting at was where kanan worked part time. It also connect to what qui gon said in the phantom menace “nothing happens by accident” he says something else but I can’t remember it.

I have seen a good number of these and am curious as to if it is possible to have a lightsaber blade that is longer than most? 
My idea is to have my character have a similar fighting style to that of Alucard in Castlevania. His sword is nearly seven feat long and he uses it like a rapier.

**Episodes:** Both 1 and 8 are really really bad. I don't know how the bookends managed to be so poor in comparison to everything in between. The rest of the episodes are pretty good. I especially like episode 2 with the Sand Crawler and Jawas. Very cool, and was the episode that made me most feel like I was watching Star Wars. 

**Characters:** Mostly a win here. All of them are interesting and unique, except the forced in female badass that has to be everywhere now. She's an alright character, but you can tell they're trying waaaay too hard to make her this total badass with her laser mini gun! Pretty poor acting chops too. Better as a MMA fighter. 

I absolutely LOVE that they got Pascal to play Mando. He was fantastic in Prospect as well.

The lead antagonist is horribly miscast, Moff Gideon. I keep expecting him to walk off set and come back with a bucket of chicken. He's just not opposing or intimidating at all and feels like he's phoning in his role. His cool, calm demeanor works wonders in Breaking Bad, where he's this huge kingpin hiding a drug empire through chicken restaurants, but Star Wars villains need to be a bit more threatening and have some gravitas to them. Gideon feels like he has all the gravitas of a 3 piece meal. 

**Music/Score:** Total garbage. The main theme grows on you a bit, Mandos, but everything else barely passes as placeholder. The whole western motif trying to be Star Wars is pretty lame and is definitely sub par to anything John Williams has produced for the universe. It doesn't even come close. 

I wish they would actually use the original music and Williams's work. Whenever I see Baby Yoda pick something up, I want that slow creep of the horn to come in just like in the Wampa cave in episode 5. The Force Theme has no rival.

**Editing and Pacing:** Hit and miss here. The side dissolves and upwards wipes are there lol, but the show feels like a Netflix production forced into the Star Wars universe. I can't really describe it. Some of it is fantastic, but it just doesn't flow as well as it should. A lot of the directing is setting up mediocre tropes  that worked well when Avengers came out in 2012, but is pretty predictable and unimaginative at this point in 2020. It's familiar and definitely not as exciting. 

**Sets/Costumes/Props:** Have to give it to them here. Everything is working as intended and everything from the backdrops to the actual gadgets the main characters use are awesome. 

My only critique here is that you can tell some of the sets are small on purpose to save on costs. I think with a bit more funding they could have eliminated this vibe, but many scenes are shot very tightly and you can tell the scene only exists inside the camera lens. It feels like if you were to look further, the scene would cease to exist and you'd see extra's, stage hands and material lying around, which pulls you out of the world a bit. 

**Script/Story:** A solid B. WAAAAAY better than the prequels scripts, I'll give the show that. The Fav can outwrite Lucas and it mostly works. There are a few cringe moments ""This is the way!"" and some lines that don't seem as genuine as they should, but this is mostly due to the acting. The underlying story is also very interesting and works well with the dynamic between Mando and Baby. 

Just my thoughts on the show. 

Yours?","Mandalorian falls short of Star Wars, but is decent entertainment"
0,"Why did the Mandalorian change his mind about taking Yoda? He said in Episode 4 that a kid travelling in a ship...something...is no life for a kid...something like that, but we see Yoda in the Razor Crest at the beginning of Episode 5....so he changed his mind? 

And then there was no explanation as to why they were being chased...as I was watching I was guessing...okay, are we going to have a ‘24 hours before’ to explain why they’re being chased? Nope. I suppose the only plausible explanation is because the pilot was hunting down Yoda 🤷🏼‍♂️. But no clarification. 

And the ending....hmm! I reckon the mysterious cape possibly belongs to Giancarlo’s Moff Gideon character because he has a cape, he’s a villain and the sniper girl was also a villain so perhaps they were allies 🤷🏼‍♂️",The Mandalorian Episode 5
0,"1) The Last Jedi.... Think about that title. Luke was a confirmed Jedi, so the title has to be referring to him. For him to be the last, it means there was no other and wouldn't be another. Further, the sacred Jedi Texts were done away with formally and officially. Literally this movie is all about how the Jedi are no more.
2) She could use force lightning, no Light-side Jedi ever could and it's usually considered a dark side power. 
3) The obvious: she's a Palpatine 
4) She wouldn't have been a sith, of course, since she didn't succumb to the dark side - a grey Jedi M.O is to be able to dabble a bit with the dark side of the force but not fall into it.",Discuss: do you guys think Rey could be considered a Grey Jedi?

0,"While I can respect the original movie as the progenitor of this series, the baby of George Lucas and one of the biggest stamps on movie history, I just don't find it that entertaining.

I really don't know what it is either. Effects are outstanding for the time, some very memorable scenes but I find it lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. Something that's missing which allows me to get a lot of enjoyment from a lot of the other movies. 

I'll say again that it is a great movie from a technical standpoint and I don't have a major complaint but I just don't find it entertaining. Your thoughts?",A Potentially Controversial Opinion
0,"Obviously, Star Wars is known for its memorable villains, all of whom are (usually) Sith or Dark Side users. But after rewatching the prequels, I got thinking: what would it be like if there was a Star Wars movie where the antagonist is a Jedi?

As many have noted, the prequels explore the failures and hypocrisies of the Jedi, and how the very order is in part, responsible for its own downfall. I think it’d be interesting to see a movie where this exploration is continued via a Jedi antagonist. Maybe this particular character believes in the Jedi code, but is an extremist; to them, anybody who doesn’t support the Jedi or the Republic is instantly enemy. Maybe they’re obsessed with the light side, and in an effort to purify the Force, seek to destroy all remnants of the Dark side throughout the galaxy. Obviously, this could cause some conflict due to their violent rampage, thus leading to a story where said character is an antagonist.

Maybe this seems like a stretch, but personally, after seeing the ST simply mimic the OT in almost every way, I can’t help but wonder about the numerous original possibilities the films could’ve taken. All in all, I’d love to hear what you all think.",How would you feel about a Star Wars film where the antagonist is a Jedi?
0,"Imagine if the entire mythology of the Sith for the past 1000 was based on a cruel lie - and that Darth Bane actually survived in the bodies of his apprentices for 1000 years through transference.

What if Bane manipulated apprentices to ""kill"" him in an act of gaining the dark side mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for themselves but which would actually be a dark side ritual Bane would use to inhabit their bodies? This would have made for an incredible twist in ST, that Palpatine wasn't even himself but actually a very ancient Sith Lord who had shown incredible patience and cleverness in order to take down his ancient enemy: the Jedi Order.

It would also keep to the prophecy to in that Darth Vader, redeemed by his son, destroyed Bane / Palpatine in an act of love for his son, not in an effort to seek more power and overthrow him.

Also: Could you imagine the prequel content for such a character and his engineering the destruction of the Sith of his time so he could control/manipulate one individual at a time until he was able to achieve his goal 1000 years later?",Would it not have made sense to make the villain of the ST Darth Bane?
0,"Now that the dust has finally settled and everyone has had time to claim down about the sequel trilogy,I would to ask everyone a question.As you all know when the prequels started coming out the fans hated them,The backlash from fans was insane people started Attacking the actors and George Lucas for quote “ruining there childhood”,But eventually the generation that grew up with the prequels started to praise the films once they finally had a voice. However now I can’t help but feel a strange since of deja vu with history pretty much repeating it self ,but instead of people be angry at George their mad at Disney. So my question how do think future generations will the sequels once they’re old enough to have a voice.",What will future generations think of the sequels?

He’s also watched the newer movies too, but since we’re on quarantine, we want to catch up on everything but he’s still out most of the day for work and doesn’t have much time to catch up on the clone wars, so I’m asking if anyone has a list of the main important lore of the show, I’ve already watched the whole show myself, I just don’t know where to start for him to see. And I’m wondering if anyone knows where I can find Fallen order in the form of a movie, cause he doesn’t really like/understand how to play modern games so I rather we just watch some sort of cutscene edit of the game.

___

Power in the Star Wars universe has been the subject of debate between fans for decades. ""Well, Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber, so he is obviously more powerful than Obi-Wan Kenobi!"" ""Yoda is the best Force user in the galaxy, he would destroy anyone else!"" Now, I present to you a fresh perspective: how Jedi hair length affects their power. Does being bald make you a better Jedi? Or having long, beautiful locks? Read on to find out.

___

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell). If I missed a couple, I apologize, please don't burn me at the stake.

**Methodology:**

There are two main data points used in this analysis: 1) hair length and 2) power level. Hair length is easy to break down: bald, short, medium, and long lengths of hair. Power level is a little more complex. It is a weighted average score based on four factors: 1) wisdom, 2) combat ability, 3) leadership, and 4) lightsaber awesomeness. Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.

___

##Table 1: Power Level Weighted Averages

This table is extremely wide, so I only included a piece of it for you to view. All power levels can be viewed in the next table. Power levels and criteria are ranked 1 - 5, with 1 being terrible and 5 being amazing.




Power Criteria | Weight | Qui-Gon Jinn | Obi-Wan Kenobi | Anakin Skywalker | Quinlan Vos | Yoda

##Table 2: Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows both hair length and power levels (in descending order). Hair falls under this definition: ""any of the fine threadlike strands growing from the skin of humans, mammals, and some other animals."" Any Jedi of a species that looks like they have hair (such as Ahsoka Tano), but doesn't fall under the definition of hair, is classified as bald.

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Hair Length|Average of Power Level|
:--|--:|
|Bald|3.11|
|Short|3.47|
|Medium|3.39|
|Long|3.52|

___

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

My memory is really vague, but I thought it was a prototype that came before the t65, or it was a scrapped design that George Lucas came up with, outside of the Star wars universe.

I'm just wondering if anyone knows more about that old Toya had? is my recollection correct? Or maybe I got it wrong and it was a figurine of the 270 that came after? Did they use it in the novels and stuff that they scrapped when they made episode 7?",T70 reuses old design?

Some people think that the species has a proportional lifespan, some people think maybe they mature fast, and some have even tried to convert “Yoda years” to standard years. 

To all that, I say: What if the Client just got the age wrong? He didn’t have a complete chain code in the first place, is it really a stretch to think that he got it wrong and the Child is really only 10 or something like that?

• Kree Central Intelligence is the amalgam of all knowledge and experience, aka the Jedi Council. 
• A couple Kree/Jedi use weapons that imitate either the Force or lightsabers

I think that they are way too similiar to each other for it to be a coincidence. I think it might show that after the whole chase after rebels, Falcon and Luke, he ended where he started, without achieving what he wanted(capturing Luke)(tho he did still destroy the rebel base on Hoth, however they did escape).

Correct behavior:

The Jedi acts true to their conscience and the way of the Jedi. 

Correct appeal:

The Jedi pays attention to their thoughts,
because they become their words.
The Jedi pays attention to their words,
because they become their actions.
The Jedi pays attention to their actions,
because they become their habits.
The Jedi pays attention to their habits,
because they shape their mind.
The Jedi pays attention to their mind,
because the mind shapes their fate.


4. Overcome fears

A feeling like fear can be a good teacher, but it is an absolutely terrible master.
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hatred and hatred leads to unspeakable despair and suffering.


5. Overcome the buildup

The Jedi separate themselves from everything insignificant. 
What is important is not acquiring more burden, but letting go of them. 
The Jedi lets go of greed, hatred, delusion and all illusions.
When the Jedi understands that there is no self, they let go to form a unity with everything else, letting go is the way to true freedom. The Jedi lets go, the unreasonable sensual attachment.
No abuse of intoxicating or addictive substances.
A Jedi is not overwhelmed by feelings, but uses them consciously and sensibly instead.


6. Forgiveness

The Jedi lets the past go, but doesn't deny it either. Healing will be experienced by looking at the present and future life, no longer dictated by past pain or resentment.
The Jedi forgive others and themselves, without denying guilt. 


7. Humility

The Jedi is friendly, humble, mannered and selfless.
Gratitude is an essential element on the path to humility.


8. Sincerity

The Jedi is honest, responsible and reliable.
They do not abuse the trust that is placed in them and - if necessary - remain silent.
These are the first steps on the path of loyalty and honor.


9. Compassion

The Jedi is considerate, empathetic, and understanding
and thus reaches true kindness.


10. Willingness to help

The Jedi help to the best of their abilities.
If possible and necessary, the Jedi alleviates the suffering of others. The Jedi does not harm anyone, unless to prevent greater harm to others and never without thought, consideration and hesitation. 


11. Bravery

The Jedi knows that bravery requires self-confidence, courage and determination. The Jedi is a keeper of peace, but when necessary, they are protectors of the weak and helpless. This is the civil courage that distinguishes a Jedi.


12. Knowledge

The Jedi realizes that every circumstance depends on conditions. They do not try to enforce things, if the circumstances do not comply. Because only if the conditions are right, everything can fit together harmoniously. 

The Jedi realizes that everything is limited and nothing is of eternal existence, everything is subject to change.
In their inner harmony, the Jedi no longer differentiate between friend, enemy or stranger, but instead recognize beings as they actually are. For Jedi, the pathway to the goal is part of goal itself.

For me, I'd say that moment for me is when Rey lifts the rocks on crait and saves the Resistance to fight another day. Let me explain.

When I was growing up, I was the target market for the prequels. I've loved Star Wars my entire life and have countless great memories thanks to George's creation. I had so much to play with in this big universe. Whether I was playing video games like Jedi Power Battles or the pandemic Battlefront games, fighting with my friends over who got to be Anakin or Darth Maul in our plastic lightsaber fights, opening my 3rd version of Obi-Wan's action figure, or going with my dad and my three best buddies to watch Revenge of the Sith in theaters for my birthday, there was always new ways to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe. 

The only problem was I could never get my little sister to love it as much as me. Sure, she would help me through the Mustafar level on Lego Star Wars and have some fun doing it, but even to this day as a young woman in college, she couldn't care less about Star Wars. The sequel trilogy has made me very aware of how hard it used to be for girls to insert themselves into Star Wars. That makes me sad because I feel like they're missing out. Carrie Fisher, Natalie Portman, and Ashley Eckstein's contributions should never be overlooked, but you can't argue with the positive impact that Rey being the main protagonist/hero in the sequels has had on female interest levels in the galaxy far far away.

That's why the lifting rocks moment in TLJ means so much to me. That was really the moment that cemented Rey as the main heroine and badass Jedi of the sequel trilogy in my opinion. The thought that a whole new demographic of people are taking their first steps into the larger world of Star Wars because they look up to Rey the same way that I looked up to Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi as a kid excites me and brings me more joy than anything else.","What's a Small Star Wars Moment that Probably Doesn't Mean Anything to Most People, but Means Everything to You?"

Who is flying the Ghost in Episode 9? Would it really make sense for it to be Hera? I think it would have to, at the least, be her son, at this point. Considering that Hera was an adult during Rebels, and the ST takes place 34 years after Return, Hera would, at the least, be well into her 50's.

0,"What you’re seeing now is exactly what you’d expect if they were.     

First, we know the powers that be are paying attention to fan demands. Thus the massive retcons in TRoS.     

They have certainly heard about the demand for the JJ version (if it exists). At the least, they know there is strong demand for an extended version.     

If they wanted to release one, they would of course aim to make as much money as possible.     

They would release the theatrical version first.    

To maximize demand for an extended version, they would leave deleted scenes off this release, just as Lord of the Rings did.    

They would make zero mention of an extended version coming later, because as soon as they did, sales for the theatrical version would dry up. So they would stay silent about it. But subtle tips from actors about all the amazing extra scenes that were filmed would be a perfect way to build demand. Likewise, hints from art books of deleted content only serves to make fans salivate for an extended version all the more.      

Then, around the next big buying season (say, Christmas 2020), they’d released the extended version as the perfect gift idea for Star Wars fans.    

This path guarantees the most cash income for Disney, as many fans would end up owning both versions.

___

Power in the Star Wars universe has been the subject of debate between fans for decades. ""Well, Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber, so he is obviously more powerful than Obi-Wan Kenobi!"" ""Yoda is the best Force user in the galaxy, he would destroy anyone else!"" Now, I present to you a fresh perspective: how Jedi hair length affects their power. Does being bald make you a better Jedi? Or having long, beautiful locks? Read on to find out.

___

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell). If I missed a couple, I apologize, please don't burn me at the stake.

**Methodology:**

There are two main data points used in this analysis: 1) hair length and 2) power level. Hair length is easy to break down: bald, short, medium, and long lengths of hair. Power level is a little more complex. It is a weighted average score based on four factors: 1) wisdom, 2) combat ability, 3) leadership, and 4) lightsaber awesomeness. Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.

___

##Table 1: Power Level Weighted Averages

This table is extremely wide, so I only included a piece of it for you to view. All power levels can be viewed in the next table. Power levels and criteria are ranked 1 - 5, with 1 being terrible and 5 being amazing.




Power Criteria | Weight | Qui-Gon Jinn | Obi-Wan Kenobi | Anakin Skywalker | Quinlan Vos | Yoda
--------------|------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|----
Wisdom | 25% | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 5
Combat Ability | 25% | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5
Leadership | 25% | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5
Lightsaber Awesomeness | 25% | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4
Weighted Average Score | 100% | 4 | 4.25 | 4 | 3.5 | 4.75

___

##Table 2: Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows both hair length and power levels (in descending order). Hair falls under this definition: ""any of the fine threadlike strands growing from the skin of humans, mammals, and some other animals."" Any Jedi of a species that looks like they have hair (such as Ahsoka Tano), but doesn't fall under the definition of hair, is classified as bald.

|Jedi Name|Hair Length|Power Score|

|Ord Enisence|Bald|2|
|Barris Offee|Medium|2|
|Knox|Bald|1.75|

___

##Table 3: Correlation Between Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Hair Length|Average of Power Level|
:--|--:|
|Bald|3.11|
|Short|3.47|
|Medium|3.39|
|Long|3.52|

___

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

0,"So here's a brief context. 

I was exposed to star wars from a young age due to some toys passed down to me from my mum/her siblings. Basically it was some plastic coins/disks collectible thing with the names of films/hologram of a character etc (not sure what they're called, if someone knows what I'm talking about itd be great). 

Anyway that's how I came to know of star wars. Then i was watching TV and came across a Star Wars film or show (this was like early 2000s when I was like 5) and I remember seeing Darth Vader (and getting nightmares about him).

I would see star wars toys in shops such as Argos but I never pursued it, although telling my self that I need to watch it some day.

5 years ago, I came across star wars rebels and fell in love with it. This re-sparked my interest in Star Wars and I basically read so much about it on the Wiki that I almost knew everything that was canon, despite only having watched the first 3/4 Rebels seasons.  

By this time I was pretty fascinated with Vader and felt sorry for Anakin.

I forgot about it, got a bit bored of it until this lockdown ensued. I was bored and didn't know what to watch so I decided to finish of Rebels. That again sparked my interest in star wars and I refreshed my knowledge and began watch first the Original trilogy and then the Prequel trilogy. 

Although there was no need as I already knew lot of star wars lore, I felt I could not truly be a star Wars fan until I watched the original six films.

I am proud to say that Ive finally finished Rebels and the original Six films. Rebels was always my favourite Star Wars media, and I'm looking forward to seeing the Ghost's crew again. Meanwhile, I will be watching the Mandalorian and then maybe the sequel trilogy.

Sorry for the terrible writing as I'm on mobile and can't be bothered to correct any mistakes.",I finally finished watching the original 6 films!
0,"In my Star Wars fanfic - the Star Wars: Reverse, **this** is how Rey is like.

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this.

Rey is a boyish loner and doesn't likes romance. She got her friend Ben in a friend zone, but later, was too proud to accept that she felt in love with him.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

Rey had a breakdown when realised what Dark Side truly is, when she tried to kill Leia, who just wanted to calm her down.

*Rey's is a mirror image of Anakin, but now, the Jedi can really help her. Rey is now more complex.*

**Rey is just a teenage girl, who doesn't actually know what she wants.**

0,"So I just started watching Rebels recently, and am still pretty early in the seasons. There was a line that Sabine says during a battle when she's docking with Ghost: ""I'm in the pocket, 5 by 1."" There is a similar line from the movie Aliens that the combat pilot says on their approach to the world: ""We're in the pipe, 5 by 5."" I know that the Aliens line us fairly common and means that they are flying true and on target but have never heard the '5 by 1' before. I assumed it was a nod to Aliens but maybe I just watch too much sci-fi. Any thoughts?",Aliens reference?
0,"I'm going to start this off with saying that Solo is genuinely my favorite Star Wars movie. I'm a big fan of the series and I love every movie in the saga quite a bit. It makes me kind of sad that the fan base (or at least from what I've seen) doesn't really talk about it that much.  I saw it when it first came out in theaters and was shocked to find it didn't do well financially. I absolutely love Solo and I think a lot of people sleep on it for various reasons. I wanted to get my thoughts out in a post and talk about why I like it so much.

* All of the actors do a great job portraying their characters

I really enjoy Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo and think he did a great job portraying what a young han looks like. For me he really captured the essence and roguish charm of Han. Let's face it, playing Ford's Solo from the original trilogy gave Ehrenreich some really large shoes to fill but in my opinion he perfectly nailed it. The same could be said for Glover's Lando Calrissian, he did a great job playing an inexperienced and confident young version of the character, and I found Glover's and Ehrenreichs chemistry to be great, they played off each other very well.  Woody Harrelson as Becket and and Emilia Clark as Qi'ra provided really enjoyable supporting roles as well.

* The action sequences are phenomenal

From the train heist to the Kessel run, Solo is really fun to watch and some of the sequences are amazingly executed. My personal favorites are the Corellia chase scene and the final showdown between Han and Becket.

* It has a ton of charm and has a really satisfying ending

There are very few moments in Star Wars that I enjoy more than Han failing badly at bluffing the thermal detonator in the Lady Proxima scene. The gambling scenes between Han and Lando are amazing as they constantly try to one-up one another.Does Solo hit all of the marks you would expect? Yes, We get the Kessel run, Han wins the Falcon from Lando, Han meets Chewie, etc. However, I really like how it hits those marks, to me it doesn't feel forced and somehow they managed to weave it all into a fun space-western style story.  I really like how Han was developed as well; at the start of the movie he's a naive kid scraping to survive with aspirations of adventure and becoming a pilot. He's not the Han we know from a new hope, a hardened, experienced, and sarcastic smuggler. We do, however, see the frame work of the Han we all know and love, although unwilling to admit it, Han is a rogue with a heart of gold and it shows during Solo. Qi'ra does a great job helping emphasize that aspect of his character and even points out as much point blank in the movie. Becket serves as a great foil to Han, showing him how he may eventually become: jaded and willing to betray others at a drop of a hat.

Solo is a personal favorite of mine and wanted to know your thoughts on it. There's a lot I didn't touch on here like the great soundtrack, costume design, and interesting locations because this already got pretty rambley but I wanted to get my thoughts out there.",Let's talk about Solo
0,"The Force is probably the greatest fictional “magic systems”. But the biggest problems with it is how many different interpretations people can have about it. I decided to just share my interpretation of the Force. For fun.

Firstly I look towards George Lucas as a person and what beliefs he holds. Because this undoubtedly influenced how he created the force. From what we know George is a Christian and lived during the Free love movement. Along with an apparent curiosity of eastern religions. So I built my interpretation around these ideas.

In my Interpretation the Force is not only alive but life manifested. The force represents fate/destiny and can influence events to meet “its will” which I believe could mean the collective desires of the galaxy. Hence why The First Order, Empire and Sepretists were able to gain such power. Because people were desiring what these factions could bring and so the force moved the pieces to make it happen.

The Father, Brother and Sister along with the wills are not true beings but just manifestations of the force that allow it to rely its will directly.

I also believe that there can never be balance in the force. The dark side and light cannot exist in peace. Because the dark side is not a natural part of the Force, but a corruption of it. It is like an addiction. Like ICE or the incredibly addictive drugs, you can rehabilitate from it but you cannot use it repeatedly without getting addicted. 

Also I believe the force is in everyone, all people need is faith. not belief, faith. I also hate the idea of power in the force. The force belongs to everyone so everyone is just as strong in it, it is merely Understanding, Faith and the will of the force that decides ones strength. Atleast for the light side.

These are just some of my ideas about the force, what do you think the Force is.",My Interpretation of the Force
0,"Lucas's view of the Force, as I understand it, is basically that there is no Dark-Light dichotomy. The ""Light side"" is just the Force in it's ""natural"" state. The Jedi believed Force-adepts should strive for a peaceful, natural, almost symbiotic relationship with the Force. The Dark side is a general term for people trying to bend the Force too closely to their will, particularly for selfish or ignoble purposes, and the abilities that manifest as a result of that. That's supposedly why ""balance"" means ""a lack of Darkness,"" because Darkness is essentially just human (or alien?) depravity and megalomania twisting the Force into something unnatural. (If this is wrong let me know!)

If this is true, how can the cave on Dagobah be, as Yoda describes in RotJ, ""strong with the Dark side of the Force""? If it's a natural formation, shouldn't it be neutral in the Force if anything? How can something inanimate by Dark-sided if Dark-sidedness comes from selfishness and megalomania?","According to George Lucas's original conception of the Force, how/why does the Dark side cave on Dagobah exist?"
0,"So I was thinking about the sequels, and how I would’ve liked to see them done, and I had an idea for how I would’ve done the sequel trilogy if I was in charge of making the canon for Disney. 

This post is a lore/set up post to the first movie of the trilogy, if you guys like it and want more I’ll write out the whole trilogy. 

This trilogy would be proceeded by an age without sith. The republic would be back, all shiny and new, but closer look would show that many systems are refusing to join the republic, making it unstable and weak. Also that good old corruption and snails pace bureaucracy is still very much alive.

The Jedi are back, with a nice shiny new temple built on....not Coruscant. Why? Because 20ish years of imperial propaganda mixed with the knowledge that Vader was once a Jedi wasn’t great for public relations. Many in the republic senate, with a few more *convinced* by Remnant spies, felt the Jedi should be banished to the outer rim, but Leia, and Luke’s reputation, convinced the senate to allow the Jedi to set up in the mid rim. 

Luke has done a pretty good job with the Jedi order. It doesn’t have a lot of strictness of the old order, and many Jedi don’t carry light sabers. The order does have a small Knight caste, but with the lack of sith and the fact that no one wanted their help most Jedi don’t carry their sabers. Leia and Han’s son is in that caste. 

Earlier I mentioned the remnant, that’s what’s left of the empire. After Endor the empire was on its last leg. They take lose after lose until they are beaten back to only a handful of systems. The imperials, their backs against a wall, bet everything on one last stand. 

After Endor the rebels had skyrocketed in numbers. Many people saw it as a chance to get rich, though some saw it as a sort of tryout for the republic military council. The republic never associated itself with the rebels, and poached their leadership, so when the remnant made its final stand the army it was facing was too large for its supply lines, with no organization. The attack is shattered, the rebels cease to exist and the republic opens diplomatic channels with the remnant. The remnant is even granted a seat in the senate during a galactic pandemic. 

Neither side is any position to fight a war, so accepting each others existence and working together wasn’t the worst idea, though remnant planners held the goal of restoring the empire. 

This had been a false golden age for the galaxy. The fear and violence of the Clone War and Imperial Era was over, but every was weak and isolated. It was a peace that would not last once the Immortal Sith put his plan into motion....",If I got to create the new canon for Disney: Episode 0: LORE

0,"I've been doing a Star Wars Marathon the past couple days, and I'm currently on Rise of Skywalker. The thing is, I think I figured out the deal with Force Healing (in universe), and why no Jedi used it.

What if, Force Healing is a Dark Side power?

Think about it. If it is a Dark Side power, it would explain why no Jedi would use it, and why Palpatine and Rey do use it in Rise of Skywalker. It also ties in with the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise from Revenge of the Sith.

Palpatine tells Anakin that Darth Plagueis was so powerful and wise in the Force that he could influence it to create life. That he ""had such a knowledge of the Dark Side that he could keep the ones he cared about from dying."" He specifically tells Anakin that the Dark Side leads to abilities like this.

Obviously, Palpatine is a Dark Side user, and Star Wars shows that Force can be passed down genetically, for example, the Skywalkers. Since Rey is Palpatine's descendent, then it could be reasoned that Rey inherited Palpatine's power as well.

But then, his old friend Cad Bane approaches him for the job of a lifetime, thus setting up a ""one last job"" kind of heist movie set in space.

As for an actor to play Boba Fett, we obviously can't bring back Temuera Morrison since he's too old and has gained weight. My ideal casting choice would be Karl Urban, since he's also from New Zealand. We can retcon Boba and say that he was his father's biological son, but he paid the Kaminoans to pretend he was a clone so the Republic wouldn't use him as leverage.

0,"OT remakes won't happen anytime soon (that would be in bad taste for a variety of reasons). But they are financially inevitable in the long run (30-50 years from now), especially after the original films start to look more like museum exhibitions than contemporary entertainment.

So remakes will happen, but not for a very long time. However, in the short-run (under quarantine), it is fun to speculate about what they could do to improve on the original movies.

As good as the OT were there were serious flaws that permeated them.  A remake could fix the following problems:

* The CGI can portray Darth Vader as a massively powerful force user  (which, despite his considerable loss of power on Mustafar, he as the chosen one absolutely still is), which the OT couldn't quite do with its CGI limitations
* The CGI can do the same thing with Obi Wan, Luke, and Palpatine
* Dialogue can be massively improved (no more Leia calling Han ""laser brain"" or Luke quipping to Vader ""you'll find I'm full of surprises"")
* As good as McDiarmid was as an actor, the makeup for the Emperor/post-Mace duel Palpatine sucked, and make him look too cartooinshly evil. (Think of how much more effective Senator Palpatine was as a character than the cartoonish Emperor in RotJ.) He would be more impactful as a character if he looked like a ""kindly"" old man with something twisted to hide; i.e. like a slightly deformed and somewhat ""frail"" version of Senator Palpatine
* Relatedly, Palpatine's and Vader's (failed) attempt to win Luke to the Dark Side should be more subtle and built-up; of course Luke rejects the Dark side but it needs to be less obvious that he will do so than it is in OT
* I honestly like the Ewoks, and think cutting them would be a bridge too far in terms of altering the OT's story; but the filmmakers need to (somehow) make their military prowess/victory over the Stormtroopers more credible. Maybe make the human-rebel force bigger, and able to contend seriously (albeit in a losing effort) against the Stormtroopers, until the Ewoks turn up and swing the tide of battle. (This is more credible than them being the entirety of the rebel force on Endor.)
* RELATEDLY, have storm troopers shoot and not miss sometimes!

Am I missing any problems? The key is fixing these things and somehow managing to capture the majesty and energy that the original films have.",Problems an OT remake could fix
0,"A quick fix to how this works is that it should be a reverse hyperspace tracking procedure. Stay with me for a bit here.

The enemies have hyperspace tracking and the gang tried to find and destroy the tracking technology but failed. Meanwhile Holdo and the rebels managed to find a signal that only appears during hyperspace that is basically the tracking technology signal linking their ship to enemy ship.

As a last resort Holdo (and/or whoever other important rebel) manages to program their ship to haphazardly follow the Hyperspace tracking signal back to its source but since the signal follows channels no one has heard of, any ship using these routes is guaranteed to blow up. The explosion is so erratic that the debris exists in both hyperspace and normal space and obliterates anything ahead of it namely the Enemy ships that were doing the tracking.

Therefore the Holdo maneuver is born. It's essentially an ability that only exists because the light speed tracking exists.  It can only happen when light speed tracking is used. It creates a balance in the way the warfare works as the enemy now risks being immediately obliterated  every time they choose to track the rebels so they have to weigh the advantages of knowing the rebel locations versus losing a few hundred men for it. The rebels have to set up a ""Kamikaze squad""/""suicide squad"" of people on the ready to intercept the enemy tracking and then light speed ram their asses. 


The clanky mechanics aren't even the important part. It's just sci-Fi. What's important is the power balance between sides during the warfare when such things as hyperspace tracking and light speed rams are invented. I think this fairly remedies such power balance issues.",A quick fix to the movies: The Holdo Maneuver
0,"Let’s look at some of the major Star Wars stuff made after the Original trilogy: Prequel trilogy, Sequel trilogy, Clone Wars, Rebels, Rogue One, Solo, The Mandalorian, Jedi: Fallen Order, Battlefront, The Force Unleashed, Knights of the Old Republic...(And a couple of other gems like Republic Commandos...)    
    
ALL movies, series and video game on that list except Knights of the Old Republic has revolved around the ~60 year time period from Episode 1-9, and even the prequels and the sequels revolved around 4,5 and 6.    
    
I recognize it DOES makes financial sense to stick around 4,5 and 6, but there is a huge, beautiful Galaxy over millennia to explore.

There are so many posts about it and it's getting old. They all seem like they're written by 13 years old and I don't get why they get so much traction. Why hate so much on a character?

The new Rey plot looks like this:

Rey is a girl, who was saved by Luke at 3 years old. He saw a good potential in her, and decided to train Rey.

He wanted her to be in Jedi Temple, but Leia, the High Jedi, saw Dark Side in Rey, and decided to welcome Rey, but still keeping an eye on her, and telling about Rey to Luke.

Rey, while growing up became friends with Ben Skywalker-Solo, Leia's son, who fell in love with her. Except Ben, everyone disliked Rey because of her rude and high horse behaviour.

Rey became more and more powerful, but she was very power-hungry. Luke and Leia were trying not to crash her strength, but to develop it.

0,"I did something not so unusual. Created some sort of a fanfic: the Star Wars: Reverse.

I changed and worked on Luke and Leia's past. Also made Leia the main protagonist.

The setup is like this: Padme survived, and gave birth to Luke and Leia, who were living in the Skywalker family for 10 years. They were accepted to a Jedi Temple, and became super promising. Leia was extra talented at Force, but with low fighting skills, Luke was worse with Force, but was much more talented at piloting and fighting.

Then, The Tragedy occurred. Padme, thanks to Palpatine's plan was killed, causing Anakin to snap. He warned his kids not to come near Jedi Temple, and got his famous rampage.

Luke and Leia wanted to run away, Leia, at the last second, decided to fly to the Temple, as her childhood friends were there. Luke, with a heavy heart fled to Tatooine, while Leia got to the Temple. 

But... When she got there, she saw nothing but corpses of dead masters and her dear friends. *Her second family*. 

Crushed Leia was saved by Bail Organa, who wanted to ask the Jedi for help, but got to the Temple late.

Luke successfully landed on Tatooine, and was greeted by his aunt and uncle.

0,"Now this is just my personal opinion but I genuinely think that Star Wars has never been about good triumphing over evil. It’s always been about The Force as it’s own entity trying to balance itself out. The Jedi are always talking about “bringing balance to the force” but the only thing they ever try to do is wipe out The Dark Side and destroy the Sith. But you can’t have balance with only one side present. The Force is not just a tool of the Jedi and Sith to be used and manipulated, it’s an entity living in all things, it doesn’t care about Good or Evil, Jedi or Sith, Light or Dark, because there is no Light or Dark side of The Force, there’s just The Force. If you look at the progression of all three trilogies chronologically every time one side gets too powerful The Force sends someone to the opposite side to create balance until that side gets too powerful and it sends another to the previous side. The original prophecy was true and came true, Anakin Skywalker was the one chosen by The Force to bring about balance to the force, he brought balance by putting more of the dark side into the mix. Then the Dark Side got too powerful so The Force sent Luke Skywalker to put more Light Side into the mix. Now the Light Side is too powerful, here’s Kylo Ren, too much Dark Side, Rey Palpatine enters. The entire time both sides thought they were using The Force but in actuality The Force was using them. I think that’s also why balance has been brought to The Force by the big names, Skywalker and Palpatine, The Force is in tune with them and their bloodline more because it chose them to bring balance, you can’t send Cal Kestis or Darth Maul or Cere Junda or Asaj Ventress because as much as we’d love to all feel special and like anyone can save the day no matter how small that’s not the case, you don’t send a boy to do a mans job, you don’t send children to fight a war, you send the one with the best chance of winning, The Force wants balance, it needs balance, and it will get it regardless of how I, you, or anyone else feels about it. This doesn’t mean that you can’t help in your own way, Rose’s gesture probably sparked a rebel in that child she met in that barn which would definitely help the cause and ripple into peace throughout the galaxy but she’s not enough to bring balance herself, Poe, Holdo, Leia, even Luke once he’d served his purpose while important in their own right are not enough to bring back balance it had to be the polar opposite of Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo, son of Han and Leia, nephew of Luke Skywalker, grandson of Darth Vader himself, Champion of both sides, but rejecting them all, he was the embodiment of The Dark Side but conflicted, able to be swayed closer to balance than you’d believe at first glance, and so who better to balance him out than Rey, daughter of unknowns, Champion of no one, the embodiment of The Light Side but like her adversary unsure of her placement in all of this she could be turned if you could get to her, but wait, she’s not just some random nobody, she’s the granddaughter of Darth Sidious aka Emperor Palpatine, slayer of the Jedi Order, there’s more to her than meets the eye, she is the only one strong enough to take on The Dark Side, because she is The Light Side, it’s not even completely about her bringing balance to The Force, without Kylo there would be no Dark Side to fight leaving only imbalance it had to be a Skywalker and so it had to be a Palpatine. Think of it as the ones who threw The Force out of balance are the ones who had to put it back.

0,"[Long]
Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.

Which leads to my current dilemma. I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.

I am completely torn on this because she Loves it and I kind of like it but I am a big ""Risk mitigation"" kind of person that wholeheartedly believes in controlling the controllables and being happy with results after that and so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.
Any help is appreciated.",Anakin Baby Name?

The perfect entry would be her showing up post Vader fight from Rebels and having a ""Did you know?!"" confrontation with Obi-Wan. In fact, that should be the opening scene before having the two of them partner for a while through the series. 

To be honest, the previous idea/premise for Kenobi that it would be him watching the twins (or just Luke) growing up sounded boring as hell, in my opinion.

0,"So I came up with a different way to bring back Palpatine.

3 Disclaimers: 

1. I am not very well trained in the ways of SW canon. I am just going to be speaking on the films for this. 

2. If this idea has already been shared, I apologize. I did a search through the sub and couldn't find it.

3. This is not a theory of what actually happened in Ep. IX. It is basically a fanfiction of what I wish would've happened.

**The Main Issue**

So the main problem I have with Ep. 9 bringing back Palpatine is I find it disrespectful to the story of the first 6 films. Ep. I-VI are the story of Anakin Skywalker. His arc is completed when he destroys the sith, brings balance to the force, and restores peace to the galaxy. But according to Ep. 9, Anakin's entire life didn't destroy the sith, it just set back Palpatine a few years. I thought this really hurt the original story. However, I loved watching Palpatine in Ep. 9. So I thought of a different way to bring Palpatine back.

**In this version of the story:**  
Palpatine is dead. He's dead. Snoke, on the other hand, is an extremely powerful Sith Lord. Not Palpatine's creation. The things Snoke does in TLJ throne room scene (throwing Rey with just the wave of a finger) suggest that he could be more powerful than Palpatine. (This was really just technological differences, but I'm gonna go with it for the story.) Anyway, every trilogy has an apprentice betray their master. 

Prequels: Palpatine betrays Plagueis

Originals: Vader betrays Palpatine

Sequels: Kylo Ren betrays Snoke

Except in the version, the sequels get an original twist: Snoke is so powerful that he is able to foresee that Kylo betrays him. 

""I can never be betrayed. I cannot be beaten!"" -Man who was betrayed and beaten seconds later

So instead of talking out of his ass, Snoke actually has a plan here. With his physical body destroyed, Snoke needs to find a new vessel. He chooses, the corpse of Emperor Palpatine. So instead of Palpatine doing some random Sith stuff and transferring his consciousness to Exegol into some clone process nobody really understands, Snoke transfers his consciousness to the corpse of Palpatine in an Exegol Sith cemetery.

**How it plays out in Episode IX**

Kylo goes to Exegol just the same. He hears the voice of Snoke instead of Palpatine. He of course comes to kill Snoke, but Snoke offers him the Final Order and they get along. Snoke has the body and voice (Ian McDiarmid) of Emperor Palpatine, but he is still Snoke. He doesn't ever claim to be Palpatine. (He can still say some of the famous lines though, cause why not). Snoke also needs to explain to Kylo that his intense use of the dark side to transfer his consciousness has drained him (sorta like Luke or Ben's death), and that this is his last chance. This is so we know that when he dies this time, he's gone for good. (Unlike Ep. 9 giving us no explanation about how Palpatine won't come back again. I know there's one in the novelization, but it should've been somewhere in the film.)

So this is Snoke's entire plan: to fake his death, then lure Kylo to Exegol so he can raise the Final Order and conquer the galaxy. He uses the corpse of Palpatine to carry this out. And yes, Snoke can use force lightning in Palpatine's body.

**Why do I like this better?**

1. Palpatine is dead. He died in Episode VI like his should have. Anakin killed him. The way the canon has it, it seems as though Anakin's entire journey was for nothing. This way, Anakin's story has much more meaning.
2. Even though Palpatine is dead, we still get to see Ian as Palpatine again, which is awesome. I guess Ian would be credited as Snoke/Palpatine.
3. The whole Rey Palpatine thing is gone. Rey is back to being a nobody, which tells us that not everyone has to be from some powerful family to be a hero. I think a lot of us like this better.

0,"Thinking back on episode viii, it's kinda functional as the conclusion to the saga?

Full disclosure- i hate tros. i think it's a hollow mess more concerned with undoing tlj than saying anything of value. but i still dont think its just my fanboyism for this movie talking. tlj kinda works as a finale, when interpreted through the lens of one character; luke.

The machete viewing order was designed to adapt the prequels into the story of Luke, having episodes II and III as a flashback after ESB. i think that you can do the same thing with the sequels, watching the first two and omitting TROS because TLJ is the conclusion for luke's character.

There are definitely problems- TLJ wasnt intended to be the finale and narratively, it leaves almost everything unresolved and open ended. This is helped by the messaging of the film *implying* an ending: rey reforms the Jedi and the first order are unable to maintain power because hope wont be extinguished yada yada yada. The issue is that, unless you omit TFA, you spend an entire movie following characters that you're going to handwave the arcs of in the next film. the only real defence i have is that i think TLJ is a better ending for Luke than RotJ, and a better ending for the ST characters than TROS offers. Kylo might be the exception here: his point of emotional turmoil at the end of TLJ isnt a phenomenal endpoint for the character, and his redemption is (imo) okay in IX, but in the case of Rey, Finn, and Poe, I think the arcs they get in their second outings are way better than what they get in IX.",The Last Jedi: The Last Movie

I feel the latter is a more appropriate title of the final trilogy. It seems to do more to tear down the franchise then build it up.

0,"I think Disney should do one last ""A Star Wars Story"" movie, mostly to cover some of the plot holes left in the sequel trilogy.

Imagine a movie similar to Rogue One, set a couple of years before Episode VII, about a group of Mercenaries on a mission. We could see (for example) the rise of the First Order happening in the background and they finding out that Palpatine has moved his consciousness in a clone body before dying during Return of the Jedi. 
Then, like in Rogue one, have some, of even all, of the protagonists killed by the hands of the Knights of Ren (or some Sith Eternals) which, from what I understood, according to the novelization of Rise of Skywalker were actually loyal to Palpatine all along. As the last scene, set some years later, we see Palpatine remotly controlling Snoke to send Kylo and some troopers to Tuanul, the village at the beginning of The Force Awakens.

The Rise of Skywalker: Rey adopts the last name “Skywalker” at the end of the film, thus being the Skywalker that rises (I’m sure the title can also be interpreted as Kylo Ren returning to the light side as Ben Solo but that’s a discussion for another day).

So what do you think? Do you think I’m over thinking this or could I be right to think this?",I just realized something about Rey and the Sequel Trilogy titles
0,"I’m a big Sequel Fan, love the era. So I decided to have a bit of fun with the era and make some stories for it. 

The Basic Idea is that it is an Anthology, set right after TLJ and would End right after the battle of Exegol.

It would feature several stories Including but not limited to

A Naboo Farmboy and Queen hiding with the Gungans trying to reclaim Naboo.

A Wookiee who goes through a spiritual journey after loosing their family to the First Order.

A Lady Pirate who wants to give up the Pirate life and discovers she has the force.

Also including other characters such as an ex imperial, a Droid Scrapper and a Jedi survivor.


They will all have an individual story but they will all unite at the end.

I feel like this is a good idea, I’m working on ordering the stories and drafting scripts at the moment. If you like the idea please leave a comment I love hearing feedback. I even credit you if I like your idea.

I may even try and do an audio drama out of them but that will depend on reception.

Thank you for reading and I hope you will get to see these soon.","I have a cool Fan Comic Idea, need an Artist"

You need Jar Jar to be there I get that. But all he is used for now is to lead Qui Gon and Obi Wan. Other than that you never see or hear him again. Peace bro. 

Dooku is still a Jedi at this time. So with Jar Jar out of the picture we have the Qui Gon and Dooku relationship added to the movie. When Qui Gon comes back with Ani he turns to his Master for advice on getting this child the proper training even though he is to old. 

I’ve always wondered where was Dooku when Qui Gon died? I’ve never really looked for the answer it was just this random Star Wars question I’ve always had. Now I have all this time on my hands so I turn to the internet. 

When Dooku finds out Qui Gon dies he turn to the dark side. 

Knowing this now kills me. I personally don’t hate Episode 1 but knowing this now I can’t see how they went with Jar Jar &gt; The dynamic shift of power of Dooku with the Death of Qui Gon.

0,"Every single time I see them, especially ANH it just blows my mind how much fitting content emerged from it. I actually really love TCW, but you cant love TCW or any other Star Wars content without paying respect to the OT.

At the time the technology did not exist for the special effects, so Lucas created them (or invested in their creation) resulting in ILM (which does 90% of AAA movie special effects these days). Star Wars was the pioneers of movies a lot of people will not understand.

Remember space movies prior to Star Wars? They all lacked depth and scale, something Star Wars achieved.

* The Clone Wars,
* Rogue One
* Rebels,
* Prequels,

(I have left out a few as I have not rewatched them enough)

\^ All 4 of them fit in so well with the OT, adding so much depth to the universe without retconning anything obvious, or anything that would damage the OT.

At the time of filming ANH a lot of the cast and crew saw no future in it. Apparently the extras were laughing at the main cast during the Medal scene in ANH because of how ""nerdy"" it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I see the background in the OT im suprised at how much content spawned from it.  ANH was literally 40 years ahead of it time.

0,"I’ve seen a lot of people make this claim and I even remember in Hishe RoS Rey tells Yoda he doesn’t need a lightsaber but I really don’t understand this complaint. Mind you I’m not talking about the lightsaber fights themselves whether you thought Yoda jumping around was goofy or not is subjective. I will concede as much as I liked Yoda fighting his former Padawan it would’ve made more sense (and be cooler) if Windu fought Dooku and saved Yoda fighting for Ep III since the only lightsaber fight we see Windu in is against Sidious which was relatively short and underwhelming 

The biggest reason I see is Yoda is strong enough he doesn’t need a lightsaber. First off ignoring in the prequels Yoda is 30 years younger and hasn’t been humbled like he was after the Clone Wars all Jedi use lightsabers. I’m sure there’s an exception in the EU but overlooking that using a lightsaber isn’t (or at least wasn’t) easy for regular people to do. Even in the EU and canon the few who can use a light saber profusely are typically incredibly trained warriors and use gadgets to help them like Boba Fett or Grevious. So clearly the force plays a part in mastering a lightsaber meaning they’re bound its like asking why Dumbledore needs a wand if he’s a powerful wizard

Even putting that aside I don’t think the prequels assassinates his character and connection to the force. Both against Dooku and Sidious the fights begin with them flexing their abilities of the force. Dooku even says their knowledge of the force is equal and the only way to decide this contest is in a lightsaber duel and partway through the fight against Sidious both of them resort to using the force and throwing the pods around. Even with all that in mind Yoda still uses the force to give himself a boost when fighting

But those are just my thoughts",Why are some people against Yoda using a lightsaber?
0,"So many fans suggest they don’t like things about the ST. Often times though, what many things we would like to be different are big, over arching thematic elements that sort of change the whole story. What we got is what we got, and those three films aren’t changing (for better or for worse) 

So, what are some smaller, maybe even nit picky things you would like to change? Things that wouldn’t alter the story or plot points of the ST, but still would have made the overall execution better for you? 

Things that come to mind for me are “I wish Luke just dropped the saber or gave it right back to Rey, as opposed to throwing it.” I like that he rejected it, just not how he did it. Also, I wish that Rey kissed Ben on the forehead and not on the lips. To me it would have been so much more meaningful and could have easily been taken as romantic or as a platonic love. I also wish theyd called the Wayfinder a Holocron, and described it as a Sith artifact that provides you with knowledge, and in this case, it is a holocron that helps guide you to Exegol

0,We know that they play concurrently with each other. What would you think if someone made an edit putting it into one huge movie and playing it chronologically? Is there a chance it could happen? It would be switching between live action and animation throughout the movie. I think it would be sick and for someone binging the franchise for the first time in chronological order (Watching CW before episode 3) Watching the edit would be the perfect way to conclude the series without going out of the chronological order. What do you think?,How would you feel about a fan edit combining Revenge of The Sith and The Siege of Mandalore into one huge movie? Could it happen?
0,"Or he was redeemed. It's up to you. I have to get this off my chest, because some people seem to think Vader's redemption is objective and they either agree or disagree with the morality.

In real life, nobody is redeemed by someone outside of themselves. There's no one keeping score. Nobody is going to tell you you're officially a good person, now. If you've done wrong, you have to live with those consequences. You have to live with the damage you have done to your relationship with the world.  You can only choose what you are going to do now. You only redeem yourself to yourself by knowing what is in your heart and following that new sense of good by acting good.

The force accepts Anakin into the light, because the force doesn't play by the morality of living beings.  The force doesn’t have emotions.  It doesn’t hold grudges. The force sees what's in a living being's heart, and that’s what matters.  It sees all the things we can't see. We can never see inside another being's heart. We can only piece it together from their actions. We may feel Vader is redeemed, because we see the force's acceptance, and therefore we see inside Vader's heart.  For that reason you could say he's redeemed.  I think there's plenty of valid reasons to believe he's is or isn't redeemed.  The most important thing for me is redemption isn’t really the point.

If you see the ending through each Luke and Vader's point of view, you'll see the ending isn't about redemption, it's about their relationship.  Vader was transformed by Luke’s love and in turn acted out of love for Luke.  Everybody can love.  No matter how good or bad you are, you can feel and act out of love for someone.  Love doesn’t necessarily transform someone from bad to good.  What love can do is soften a heart.  It can transform the inhuman into human.  Vader was transformed from a monster to be feared into a flawed human to be pitied.  From Vader to Anakin.  In those final moments Luke gets to speak with Anakin, not the redeemed villain, but the flawed and complicated human and father that was lost inside his own darkness and unable to love anything but his own power.  The ending isn’t Vader saves Luke from the Emperor, but that Luke saves his father from Vader.  It’s something outside the bounds of labels like good and bad and into the transcendent.","Vader was not redeemed, but he was loved."

0,"Since you guys liked the last one so much, Im posting another snippet for constructive critique. The scene in question takes place on one of the lowest levels of coruscant, as Kylo Ren desperately searches for something revealed to him in a sith holocron, something he believes will give him the edge he needs to with a galactic civil war and purge the galaxy of the jedi and their influence once and for all. 

""Kylo and his men push onwards, before finally arriving at their destination. The structure they find is ancient, its entrance surrounded by pillars of blackened stone, carved with symbols that kylo cannot make out as being of jedi or sith origin. He feels a presence calling out to him, and he, flanked by his knights and inquisitors, proceed into the structure. They head down ancient corridors, the walls marked in a dead language and lightsaber marks from battles fought long ago. Finally, they enter a chamber that appears to be an amphitheater. 

At one end, there appears a figure, draped in shadows. The figures breathing is labored and mechanical. Kylo reaches out with the force, demands this specter reveal its identity. The figure turns, igniting a lightsaber as the red glow illuminates its face, revealing the mask of darth vader. This specter is clad in damaged armor, melted and twisted by fire. As it moves forward, the knights of ren take a defensive stance as kylo ignites his saber. He demands to know the specters true identity, that darth vader died on endor. The specter speaks in the voice of darth vader as it states that it is kylo’s undoing. It then advances, moving unnaturally swift as it cuts down one of kylos knights. They attempt to advance and encircle it, but they and the inquisitors are no match for a full sith lord. Kylo looks back to where they entered, but the entry way has been blocked by stone. He then turns to face his grandfather’s image, his knights and inquisitors laying dead upon the ground, some in more than one piece.

 Kylo takes up a defensive stance as he declares that he will not be defeated by a ghost, and that his grandfather was weak, beholden to his emotions and sentimentality. But vader counters that kylo ren is but a child in a mask, a failure. He then delivers a strong downward blow which kylo blocks, his own lightsaber pushed to within an inch of his face. Vader tells him that kylos attempts to complete his legacy are a folly, and that his failure to learn from vaders mistakes will be his doom. They continue to exchange blows, with kylo jumping backwards to gain distance. He attempts to use the force in anger, to hold back darth vader, but its of no use as darth vader advances, blade in hand. Realizing his death is close at hand, kylo attempts to strike out at his grandfather, but dath vader parries his blows until finally, they are locked in place as kylo attempts to hold off his grandfathers saber, the blade growing closer to his face. Out of moves, he quickly moves his head, turning off his lightsaber and dropping it from his hand, before grabbing it with his other and reigniting it aimed squarely at vaders chest. When kylo looks upon his opponent though, he no longer sees the specter of darth vader, but of Anakin skywalker.""",Yet another snippet from my episode 9 rewrite
0,"I think that Phasma was a criminally underused character in the sequels, and while additional materials like comics certainly expanded on her character, it's really a shame that she (at least according to people who worked on Episode 8) is dead. She was used for little more than gags and didn't get the imposing presence she should've had.

I really would've liked to see an arc for her set after episode 8 (or even after episode 9) where she comes to realization with the fact that the First Order failed, and that what it stood for was evil. Perhaps there's still potential for something like this, since her death hasn't been confirmed in-universe (only by the actors).

Your thoughts?",It's a shame we won't get more Captain Phasma
0,"I just joined this sub a few hours ago. I’m sorry if I’m essentially reposting something that somebody else has already posted forever ago. 

I’ve been rewatching the Star Wars movies throughout this coronavirus quarantine. I’m also a huge EU nerd. I’ve been thinking a lot about the prophecy revolving around Anakin. The prophecy of course is that Anakin Skywalker, the child with a midi-chlorian level surpassing even the most renowned Jedi and Sith in know history would bring complete balance to the force.

I’ve seen tons of posts stating that Darth Vader killing the Emperor was the fulfillment of the prophecy. I’ve also seen posts that Luke Skywalker was the actual chosen one because he fulfilled his fathers destiny. I disagree with these theories. 

In RotS Obi-wan says, “You were meant to destroy the Sith, not join them.” In RotS yoda also mentions that the prophecy could have been misread. In EU the sith have a very similar prophecy about a very powerful dark side user who would destroy the Sith. This would allow the Sith order to be rebuild in a different, more productive way. Neither of these views reflect the prophecy as it is written.

The prophecy clearly states that balance will be brought to the force. How can the force be balanced if either the light side or dark side has more control over the galaxy than the other? Either option is not a leveled playing field. The only way to bring balance to the force is to completely destroy both the Sith and the Jedi. I believe that the 3rd trilogy attempted to do this. Obviously the 3rd trilogy was a complete failure in this aspect as well as MANY others. 

The correct ending to the Saga was for Luke to find a balance between dark and light. The ability to harness both aggression and restraint would be the ultimate culmination of the force. I believe that Darth Vader came to this realization just before his death. He was defensive of his son and angry with the Emperor for attempting to supplant him, but at the same time he required calculated focus in order to cloud the Emperor’s mind from his true intentions. Think about how powerful Palpatine was. He was able to implant thoughts into other people’s heads in order to bend their will. He was also able to conceal his power from the entire Jedi Order. It would take complete balance to defeat a foe with such cunning and raw power. 

The prophecy was misread by the Jedi because it was clouded by their dogmatic view. This is why the Jedi failed. The Sith failed for the same exact reason. Instead of reading the prophecy with an open mind, they both attempted to bend the meaning of the prophecy to fit their own view of the galaxy. Without an all encompassing view of the force the Jedi and the Sith were doomed to repeat their cycle of destruction until the end of time.

Luke was supposed to have learned from his father and embraced both sides of the force. Anakin’s entire story arc was supposed to be the lesson that would teach every generation of force user for eternity.

The Jedi Code: 

There is no emotion, there is peace
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge
There is no passion, there is serenity
There is no chaos, there is harmony
There is no death, there is the force

The Sith Code: 

Peace is a lie, there is only passion
Through passion, I gain strength
Through strength, I gain power
Through power, I gain victory
Through victory, my chains are broken, the force shall set me free

Combine these codes:
 
There is no harmony without chaos
There is no serenity without passion
There is no strength without knowledge
There is no peace without victory
There is only the force

Anakin fulfilled his destiny by acting as the preverbal stepping stone to inner balance.

If you actually read this far, I hope you enjoyed my rant :-)",The Chosen One
0,"After seeing tros I felt there was a huge missed potential for the Knights. I do know why they werent included as much, but I still want to express my thoughts on a way they could have been included.

First off, during the opening scene with Kylo shredding through his enemies, the Knights could have been included accompanying him and tearing down ranks as well as showing each of their fighting styles. And no, I don't mean specifically showing each on individually I mean just a general wide shot of them going through combat, just a simple extra 45 seconds or something. I felt it would have showed the Knights level of threat and experience in addition to not taking up alot much screen time.

A few other scenes that could have been included is a brief encounter before Finn, Po, and Chewie get into the millennium falcon to rescue Rey. Example of how this scene might go: Finn is lagging behind as they run to the Falcon, out of nowhere Trudgen and Vicrul come out to try and re-capture him and they begin fighting, Finn using the same baton Phasma fought him with. Finn is clearly getting over powered by both Knights so Po comes to help after he orders chewie to start the falcon. Soon, reinforcements being filling the room as chewie begins firing at them using the falcons turret, the knights are winning but back off of the fight as chewie clears the first wave of reinforcements and begins aiming the turret at them. Po and Finn narrowly being their escape as the Knights begin firing their blasters at them. but as they do chewie aims and begins to fire, but both swiftly dodge and move to cover.

I feel this would have displayed some more raw skill in battle, even besting main characters who would normally insta-win via plot armor while avoiding free kills that these main characters always get on enemy characters, hence chewie not being able to kill them with the turret.

One last major fight that could have had more was Kylo vs the Knights. Before I get into it I feel a major plot that should have changed was Leia's death, I feel it should have happened during this scene, here's why. During the fight scene between Rey and Kylo Rey still stabs Kylo but instead she just force heals him and leaves instead of Leia dying halfway through. Instead, Kylo begins to feel the light side more, but still battles the dark as well. He still goes to Exogul, but hes kind of in between like a grey jedi for a while, Palpatine senses this and sends the knights to capture him since he is considered a non-sith, making him a lost cause in Palpatines eyes.

The fight would go something like this: The knights still beat the shit out of Kylo until Rey senses his struggle between Light and dark (More light than dark though) and gives him the lightsaber while speaking to him via the force. When he pulls out the light saber, the Knights instantly enter combat mode against him instead of standing around for 3 seconds like idiots. Ap'lek showcases his smoke here, casuing the area around kylo to be filled with smoke. As the  smoke surrounds him he begins using his force sense to try and find where the Knights are around him when blaster fire from Kuruk and Cardo come at Kylo. Kylo begins deflecting the shots then abruptly they stop as Trudgen, Ap'lek and Ushar emerge from the smoke to attack. A fight insues as they team up on Kylo. Kylo begins losing the fight as palpatine mentally torments him into returning to the dark, he offers to spare him (palpatine is lying to manipulate him). More smoke begins to cloud the area as they fight and now the Knights begin to try and trick Kylo by returning to the smoke. Out of the smoke comes a thick wall of flames from Cardo and Kylo backs up to only come in range of the other knights as one last fight insues. During the fight Leia notices Kylo's struggle and repeats what she did earlier, but instead it happens here. When she dies, Kylo feels the influence of the Lightside, and sends a massive force blast around him removing all the smoke and knocking the knights down, this is when he beings dispatching them. Kylo begins taking them out with ease, much like how Luke did in the comic but not as fast, he ultimately comes out more powerful and ready to kill palpatin in honor of what Leia just did for him.

I know its a wall, but its been on my mind frequently and thought I would share, I know their might be a few issues plot wise when connecting it together with what the film is now, but just imagine this scene on its own, I feel it would be a more honorable death to them then what they got.",Scenes the Knights of Ren could have had (Read if you enjoy made up scenarios that would look cool in star wars)

0,"Yellow is the color of youth, creation, technology so Rey’s creation of her golden/yellow lightsaber on Tatooine in the final Skywalker Saga movie is a direct riff on Anakin’s creation of golden C-3PO and his yellow podracer on Tatooine in the first Skywalker Saga movie. Anakin has maintained his association with the color yellow with his use of the Naboo starfighter, the airspeeder in Attack of The Clones, and his Jedi starfighters in The Clone Wars and Revenge of The Sith. This was a severe sign of him not being able to mature because of the Jedi’s teachings that use reason to hold back his passions. Rey’s creation of a yellow lightsaber at the end of her journey is indicative of the renewal of a new childhood rather than a regression to it. She dies a Palpatine and retires her adulthood as she is reborn a Skywalker (via Ben Solo’s life force) and is given a new childhood. The final scene is her returning to a familiar home to honor the Skywalker legacy by burying the lightsabers and also to make peace with her own upbringing.

The green lightsaber represents the balance that’s holding passion (red) and reason (blue) in tension. Qui-Gon Jinn wielded a green lightsaber which represents his underlying dislike of the teachings of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker wielded a green lightsaber as he was tempted by both the light and dark sides. The yellow lightsaber represents the transcending of both the red and the blue. The red lightsaber, representative of the Sith, is cast into the sea. The blue lightsabers, representative of the Jedi, are buried underneath the surface of land. The yellow lightsaber is a symbol that represents the Skywalker family, a family known cheat the deaths of the ones they love by virtue of compassion and self-sacrifice.",The Meaning Behind Rey’s Yellow Lightsaber

I didn't mind in episode 9 that every single Star Destroyer fleet on Exegol had a planet destroying cannon on them. Was badass, just odd they didn't go for that in the very first place..

So anyways, my point being, it just felt like, ""oh hey, all that work we did in the movie(s) to bring down the Death Star, which resulted in many tragic and emotional losses. Well, it's okay, because some time after destroying it, the Empire is gonna be like, oh well guess what, we're back in stock with your favorite galaxy destroying battle station!""

0,"So with the 3rd episode of the Ahsoka arc having been released with one more left for her part of the story leading into the Siege of Mandalore, her character development has been quite lack luster to me. It feels like a lot of the spotlight is being given to the supporting characters and a lot of good character development for one of our main characters, Ahsoka, is being swept a bit to the side. 

Don’t get me wrong, having good fleshed out side/filler characters is always a plus because it adds a lot to the over all narrative. 

However, it seems like Disney is missing a big opportunity here with Ahsoka having to confront her grey side transitioning having just left the Jedi order and questioning her ideals and moral codes. When Raffa and Trace were telling the truth to Ahsoka about how their parents died in detail involving some Season 2 moments with Cad Bane/Ziro, I went back to watch the episode (Hostage Crisis) and as far as I could tell the whole scene doesn’t quite match up with what Raffa and Trace tell us, but that’s a different issue. 

My main issue was that Disney could have pulled an “age of ultron” moment where ahsoka would’ve been the Jedi who was responsible for the destruction of the speeder carrying Ziro that caused Raffa and Trace’s parents’ deaths. She would’ve had to deal with the guilt of having innocent blood on her hands when in her mind she was doing something inherently “good” but it still had bad consequences because of the situation. This would’ve played much better into their (Disney) narrative of Trace and Raffa not liking and keeping their distance from Jedi for the reasons they gave, which were very solid reasons. 

It just seems like her portrayal so far in these last three episodes haven’t been much character development that I was expecting since we know where she ends up in Rebels and how her attitude has changed since leaving the Order. This is just my opinion and was wondering what you guys thought about the current Ahsoka arc?",Unpopular Opinion: Ahsoka deserves a better character building arc - so far

0,"I don't know if this has been discussed here to not so i thought i would throw my theory out to you all to see what you think and if others have some input too.

So, I have a theory about the fate of Ezra and Thrawn. At the end of Season 4 of Rebels Thrawn and Ezra jump to hyperspace with the aid of the Purrgil. I think that Ezra was able to use his ability to comunnicate with creatures through the force to jump with the Purrgils and control their travel through Hyperspace.

In the Thrawn books we discover that the Chiss Assendancy use force sensitive children to nagivate through the Uknown Regions due to its changing nature. We also see Darth Vader doing this too. These groups use the naviation controls of the ships themselves to travel so i think that Ezra was able to do it via the Purrgils.

This leaves the question of where they end up. I personally think that Ezra was listening to the force and has ended up in some remote location in the Unknown Regions and have come in contact with the Grisks that are in the Thrawn book or are somewhere else in the Unkown Regions.

Thanks for reading, i'd like to hear what you think.","[Spoilers] Personal theory about the fate of certain characters (SPOILERS FOR: Rebels (all seasons), Thrawn, Thrawn: Alliences and Thrawn: Treason"
0,"Alright, I just watched the first episode of this supposedly ""great"" Star Wars show, and while I wasn't expecting much, it hit FAR below the mark of Star Wars and is pretty piss poor as a piece of standalone entertainment without the franchise power behind it: ""urr muh gawd babi yoda!!!!""

To start, I totally forgot this was Disney. It felt like a Netflix treatment of a franchise: smaller sets, tight shots, scarce landscapes with just a single character in it etc. Anything to save some money and it shows. It was really weak, and the garbage editing only exacerbated this entourage of banality. Where's the big slow pans and the large establishing shots? Oh that's right. No budget for those lol. 

The pacing, setups, delivery of lines: Mediocre and expected. Nothing new. No new boundaries pushed. No surprises. ""I said you made me spill my DRANK!""

The score: This is the biggest insult this show throws at you. It's probably one of the worst matched soundtracks I have ever witnessed in a show. It certainly doesn't fit what is on screen and is DEFINITELY NOT Star Wars. Like the whole western theme in the OK Corral shootout... What the hell is this show? Again, this is DEFINITELY NOT Star Wars. The music was such a big part of this franchise and this is like pissing on John Williams head.

The Scenes: These are a bunch of pre-scripted sequences that writers pulled out of antiquity and just dressed it up in Star Wars. Again, nothing new. No new territory discovered. I rest my case with the OK Corral shootout scene and ""I'm going to walk into a bar..."" scene. So original. This is Star Wars. There are sooooo many cool things you can do. 

The Characters: Weak as hell, including the Mandalorian with his garbage one liners. When your main character is in a mask, they need to emote in other ways. Have you seen the lame pansexual walk this dude has? His voice is alright but it's just... there. It works but is nothing special. There's no mannerisms or personality to the Mandalorian at all. You could literally put ANY actor/actress in that role and they could pull it off. Only Edward Norton can be King Baldwin IV in Kingdom of Heaven. Only James Earl Jones can be the voice of Darth Vader. But the Mandalorian is so copy and paste that a 50 year old female could play him, with only an extra for the stunts. 

This is what happens when people are used to mediocre entertainment and something with some franchise power comes along. It tricks people into believing it's far better than it is. 

This show is another whore on the corner for Disney and Star Wars. They took the supreme IP of all time and managed to make it as typical as an episode of Seinfeld. 

Well done.",The Mandalorian is the biggest pile of crap
0,"Anybody remember the old Star Wars radio drama by Brian Daley that was broadcast back in 1981?

It was made without any knowledge of how the saga would evolve in the future (except ESB, maybe? Not sure given the broadcast date) and yet, some of the lines actually do foreshadow things.

**Episode 3: Vader Still Hates Sand**

  This is the final scene aboard the Tantive IV. Vader growls ""I want them found even it means tearing apart bit by bit this miserable speck of a planet. This **TATOOINE!!!**"" Hilarously over the top cartoon villain stuff. Yet, 20 years later, it turns out... he really *does* have a reason to hate Tatooine. It's not just generic disdain for an Outer Rim slumworld.

**Episode 5: Obi-Wan is what he hates: a politician.**

""He betrayed **your father** and murdered him. **His** name was Darth Vader.""

Nice bit of weasely phrasing and plausible deniability there, old man. (And though ESB was already out, we didn't know whether Vader was telling the truth. That was actually the Big Question all the way up to ROTJ's release.)

**Episode 8: The ability to destroy planets is no match for the power of incest.**

This is the extended scene of Vader interrogating Leia with the mind probe. Here's part of the dialog: ""Your father commands you to tell us. Don't you wish to please your father? Then tell me what you did with those plans."" Umm... now I'm sure Lucas didn't let Daley in on *that* family link.",Star Wars Radio Drama: Unintentional foreshadowing/funny lines.

0,"As an Australian I cannot help but notice some of the similarities between Naboo and Australia.

Now while Australia isn’t directly ruled by the queen we are still part of the commonwealth. It’s very complicated to explain. Basically the queen is still in charge but our government holds all the real power. Similar to the queen of Naboo being at the whims of the senate. Bit of a stretch I know. 

The planet is a colony of mostly farmers, again very similar to the first fleet of Australia. Minus all the convicts, they even have a day of celebration for it. That is very similar to Australia.

The Divide between the Human and Gungans is also very similar to the divide between Settlers and Aboriginal People in Australia. Although I doubt the humans kidnapped Gungans to make them more human like.

Trade is a very important part of Australia, as well as for Naboo. If Australia was blocked from trade it would be disastrous.

0,"Lightsabers, lasers, aliens, space ships, planets, moons, droids, space wizards...everything about Star Wars is tailor made for little kids to go nuts over. However, almost anyone who watches these movies for the first time as adults are unimpressed. 

The original trilogy has mediocre or sometimes bad acting (other than James Earl Jones and Harrison Ford). The story is a generic hero's journey at best, and at worst it's the imagination of a nerdy man-child run amuck. The jokes are bad, the editing transitions are tacky. I firmly believe those movies were carried by John Williams and whoever was involved with the special effects and the prop / set / model design. 

The prequel trilogy is even worse than the original. These movies are so poorly written, they make the original scripts look like the work of Shakespeare. To make matters worse, the early 2000s CGI has aged horribly, these movies are aesthetically atrocious. 

With all that beings said, I love the original Star Wars movies and the prequels. Why? Because I watched them as a kid and I have fond memories of being blown away by jedis and stuff

Do they go w/ High Republic which distances us from IX time-wise and carves out a new era in Star Wars, with albeit,  more prequels, OR do they embrace IX's messiness and push the canon forward, which is giving us more of these characters who weren't served well by the ST?

Hi All -- I have been a fan of Star Wars since they started [70's?] and am just now finding out how it all started. The actual beginning of the story eluded me for years and since I never did see it in sequence, I never knew who was fighting who. Just a lot of saber fighting and thousands of guys in white metal something or other. Now I've just finished watching Chapter xi and tomorrow is the Return of the Jedi. Wow!! How exciting is my life in solitary confinement! How amazing George Lucas was to come up with the storyline and the out of this world characters. Chewbacca, Ewodees, Jabba and all those unimaginable critters. 

I can also see why the children back then loved those saber swords. They looked less threatening than ordinary swords but they were actually more so. I saw the original Anakin when he was very young and handsome and a nice guy and then I LOVED Darth Vader in all his blackness. I missed so much of all this back then that I watched for two full afternoons and again tomorrow I get to see the newer one [to me] with Adam Driver in it. I'll miss Darth and his flying black cape. I never knew why he was wrapped in black until I saw the movie when he fell down somewhere and got burned all over. Again WOW - they put him back together again like Humpty Dumpty!! 

I especially love Obi Ben Obin? and the role he played in it all. And who didn't love Joda? I actually teared up when he was dying. I was talking to (young cousin) at your Xmas dinner about Yoda and I wish I could remember what she told me about the Baby Yoda. Is he in any future movies? How original is that guy?? Lucas again with his great imagination. 

I actually liked Harrison Ford in this series. I have never thought of him as a very good actor but he proved me wrong in this movie. Well Now that I know who is who and why it matters, I can enjoy the rest of the series and know who the Force is and the Empire and the Jedi. But I really can't see how the newer series can possibly top the original ones with a young Luke and Leia and Chewie. Did Chewie make it into the newer ones? But of course, he must have, because Han Solo is there in all his senior years and holding it all together. 

Well, boys and girls, I'm just happy to join the Star Wars followers and see what outer space is going to open up to me now.  Now we can all discuss this series over (aunt's) next dinner party.     Signing Off, for now,      Love to All     ","My 92 year old grandma's reaction to watching Star Wars...

During the time I was a big fan of the old sceptics, debunking ""dumb"" religious people with facts and logic. Then the Anti Feminist stuff started getting popular, at the time I didnt care what they the skeptics were saying, I just liked them spouting facts to prove that someone was an idiot.

People didn’t appreciate the prequels as much as they do now when they were released, and I had very high hopes with the release of TFA (I even got totally sucked into the Rey Palpatine theory as it would be a very cool counter to the other six films (which also brings me back to TLJ having just saying “naw duck the main storyline and mystery” and having Rey’s parents be “nobody”) I could see objectively how it was enjoyable and introduced new and fun characters. I was especially stuck on the small hints of Finn later becoming a Jedi, or at least force sensitive (which was also ruined by Rian Johnson—who made him the “Ha ha XD funny token black guy”. Hell his first scene in the movie is “look how clumsy and stupid I am. Haha there’s water coming out of me isn’t that funny?”) which you can see JJ try to salvage in TRS. I was in the boat that everybody was hating on it because it was new and a soft reboot that we would all end up appreciating in another 20 years. And boy did that stop with TLJ. I still even tried to appreciate that movie, hell even though I hated the scene I was optimistic to explore a force sensitive Leia—RIP Carrie Fischer—but unfortunately that was out of anybody’s control. Crait was beautiful and I enjoyed Adam Driver. Speaking of Adam Driver—I thoroughly enjoyed him and his portrayal of Kyle Ren. I know a lot of people did not, but I thought it was perfect—a conflicted “wannabe Vader” who struggled to contain his emotions. I thought he was very intriguing and was excited to explore his backstory, until Rian came up with that excuse for and origin story. And I also enjoyed Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, John Boyega—the whole bunch. Really I could just see the sequels to turn out to be a beautiful thing that was just being hated on and was under-appreciated. And I strongly believe that this would have stuck through the whole trilogy, had it not been for Rian Johnson and the cesspool that’s is The Last Jedi. 

tl:dr If JJ had had full reigns (or nearly any director besides Rian Johnson) of the movies—especially TLJ than I believe that the sequels would eventually be remembered fondly, had a consistent and memorable storyline, and would have just been all around great Star Wars films (AKA super hyped for the recuts etc. 😃)",My hot take on the sequels (recut hype!😃😃)
0,"As I've stated before, I'm watching all the Star Wars (movies and cartoons) in chronological order. I first watched star wars when it came on TV in the early 80's. I honestly don't remember if I saw the other 2 (episodes 5 &amp; 6) at the theaters or on TV but I surely watched them before the remakes. With that said, watching the remakes are cool and all but I want the original theatrical versions. I just wish disney would plat all versions or at least the original theatrical versions. What about you?",I wish Disney+ would show the original theatrical version of Star Wars
0,"Sorry this is a little all over the place.  I just watched episode IX for the first time, and I'm trying to make sense of it all, particularly what this means to the lore of Anakin Skywalker.

Given Palpatine's history, if you told me he revived himself my first assumption would be that he would want to train a new apprentice, but he doesn't.

He creates Snoke as a manifestation of himself instead of training a new apprentice to effect his will.  He then lures Rey to Exegol to try to make her become not the new Sith apprentice, but the new Master.  Is it that he lacks the strength to train a new apprentice and needed someone already trained to become the new Master?  Is something about the mechanics of the rule of two fundamentally broken due to the actions of Anakin?  I feel like there is something really interesting going on here and it's kind of an itch I can't scratch.  

It seems Anakin did indeed end the rule of two, but did not end the Sith.  I'm also inclined to say he brought balance to the force by helping end a corrupt Jedi order.  Yoda talks about how arrogant young jedi have become in the prequels, and his force ghost talks about how it is time to move on from the old ways in the sequels.  But more to the point, we see Rey use the ability to transfer life to heal people instead of hurt them - this practice of any form was considered unnatural by the jedi order from as early as Ajunta Pall.  But Rey shows that no particular knolwedge is inherently evil, it's what you do with it.  The Jedi order had too much fear and pride, and embraced form over function, so I think part of Anakin's destiny of balancing the force was rebooting the jedi order.  Does that make sense?

Side question: was the dyad between Rey and Ben broken when Palpatine absorbed it?",Why was Palpatine recruiting Rey to be the Master instead of the Apprentice?
0,"I would have loves an ST with Darth Caedus as the main villan, even if they changed him a little. I wouldn't actually care if they kept him as Jacen Solo, but I wanted to see Caedus in an actual movie because Luke said he was as powerful as Vader, and that's something Kylo Ren was definitely not.

Plus the dude was able to fight with a hole in his stomach and a missing arm, and I just think that's badass for some reason. Imagine getting your arm chopped off and stabbed in the stomach by a lightsaber and STILL FIGHTING..","If Disney had used a Sith from legends at the main ST villian, would you prefer Darth Caedus or Darth Krayt?"
0,"I don't mean for this to be a negative post though I get how the title could make it seem easy enough to slide down that way. But the other day reading the TROS novelization and hearing the call-ins the ghost and Kaz and Alphabet squadron I finally gave up on getting anything with Rogue Squadron in it. I had constantly been holding out hope that some eventually we would get stories of them in the NEU (sure we got them getting named in the main comic but that is about it. Sadly we haven't really even gotten pilot!luke in the main comic) if just between Hope Dies and Endor. But after the book I've finally given up on it. If it happens it happens and I will be happy but its not something I'm holding out hope for.

Same for Hyperspace travel which used to be my major pet peeve. Sure I hope that more writers will follow Zhan's ideas of how it works but its a hill i'm giving up.

And honestly I'm just about to give up on getting any post Jakku luke stories anytime soon. If we get any before 2022 I'll be really surprised.

Though their are still things I'm hoping to see. The VD was full of TotJ stuff and their are still all of those unfinished TCW arcs that would make good comics or novels.

And that he was right that the Jedi were holding him back and that he was more valuable than they were leading on.   He approached him almost as a friend and  tried to use his emotions as sort of a way of selling him on the dark side


Yet in ROTJ, he was just straight up shitting all over Luke and the Rebel and was just directly trying to piss him off

I just thought it was a really cool detail that I missed the first time through. (probably due to the shock and awe of Vader). It really shows where their mindset is at.

0,"The OT is composed of good films from a critical point of view with good storytelling capacity that became instant classics. The introduction of Ewoks might have spoiled a thoughtful ending to the trilogy.

The Prequels show the Jedi at their best yet bring elements with the hopes of appealing to a broader audience like the 'comic relief' and a romance with no chemistry. This trilogy is saved by space Jesus and an infinite provision of memes. 

The Sequels were up to a good start, except for the part where a literal stormtrooper isn't cut in half by Luke Skywalker's former apprentice. then the second movie takes away some of the magic of the Jedi and turns the hero of the OT into an edgy and hard to approach character to say the least. Finally the end of the saga bets on nostalgia and what could've been a self-made character is blood tied to someone who comes out of nowhere, giving the intergalactical conflict the feeling of being a Skywalker vs. Palpatine story.",A simple take on the Skywalker saga.
0,"Sorry if I don't know the full story and if some of my points are wrong this is just what I know and I want more answers and opinions.

So a young kid I remember watching the Original Trilogy on TV once but remember nothing about them now. Since the release of Disney Plus I went on there to watch all the Star Wars movies in Order from 1 - 8. After watching the prequels I decided to research them a bit more and found out the prequels were hated for the actors who played Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). I understand why people found Jar Jar annoying but why Anakin? Specifically why Hayden? Do you hate the prequels and these actors? For me the prequels got more and more engaging as they became more action packed. The story of Anakin/Vader was interesting but also very sad. This made me particularly enjoy Revenge of the Sith.

I remember hearing about Disney now having control of Star Wars and after watching the sequels (7 and 8) I also looked into them. I found out George Lucas' story was mostly scrapped. After watching them I can see why people hate Disney's twist on the sequels, (When browsing the internet I have also heard huge spoilers about Episode 9 so some things I have heard about also make me question the sequels). Did The Force Awakens only earn a lot in the Box Office since it was the first movie Star Wars movie since 2005, because it was the sequels, because it was made by Disney? Now I too have become interested in really wanting to know what George Lucas' plan for the sequels were. Do you think we will ever see them on the big screen? I still am thinking about the sequels but I don't know if I have more questions. Do you hate Disney's sequels?

I have read some stuff on why George Lucas sold it off to Disney and what we know about his sequels. I just felt this community might be able to give me some more insight and their opinions.",The prequels and George Lucas' sequels. Questions and opinions from the perspective of a young teenager.
0,"Here's the thing about the star wars saga, you have the original trilogy, which has a well established problem which is resolved by the end, in the prequel trilogy, they create the original problem and leave it unresolved, but then you have the sequels, which rehash the original in moronic nostalgic fashion. Now, if they had left out the first order/resistance bullshit and focused on what was left, i think we wouldve had a great trilogy, but nooooo the galaxy always has to be in peril, it cant just be one family in peril.

Luke couldve rebuilt the jedi order, leia coulve rebuilt democracy, making mama padme proud, and because she is the reason han became a good guy, her focusing on the government wouldve still left him to turn back to his old ways. Ben couldve still joined the jedi order and to make it relateable and realistic, the adults could hidden vaders true identity from him like kenobi did to Luke, setting little ben off on a path to the darkside when he found out the truth, and the trilogy couldve been about coming together and saving ben from the dark side, a sort of redemption by proxy theme, because anakin didnt have any family to keep him from going dark in the first place, his mom was dead, he tried killing his wife(and kids), and his mentor was just spouting absolute garbage about them being brothers. ""It takes a village..."" Could have also been a theme, as it wouldve been a group effort to save little ben, rey definitely still couldve been worked into that plot, hell even poe and finn, just not as resistance and ex first order. They couldve expounded on snokes character as a last remnant of palpatines empire and a student of the sith, little ben couldve of sought him out when he learns the truth about his grandfather.

But Kylo seems to get a lot of praise and I don’t get it.  He is literally a cheap version of Darth Vader.  Guy who is good Jedi and has a ton of potential and he turns bad and then is redeemed at the end.  Where have we seen that before ???!

0,Back in the 80’s they made 3 movies then disappeared for 16 years. Then they came back for my childhood in the early 2000’s then disappeared again for a decade. I feel like if the last Jedi was as successful as TFA then Star Wars would be similar to the mcu at this point where we would be getting 2-3 Star Wars movies a year. So downvote me all you want I’m genuinely happy the last Jedi killed those plans because of all the backlash. The last thing I want for star wars is it to be like the mcu. They should focus on the mandolorian and that’s it. Take a decade off from making movies cause it’s a big part of what makes Star Wars so special.,Star Wars is special to me because it goes away.

Just a fun theory. Wife was watching Matilda yesterday on Netflix and something dawned on my that has never come to me before.

What if Matilda wasn't controlling things with her mind through how smart she was but was force sensitive. 

I know what people are thinking....that's a load of crap but think about how she acts. She was always passive and when she did act on people with her force powers she never conflicted lots of harm on her victims, just scared them a bit. Also she has a thirst for learning from a early age, the force may have given her that thirst....all force users have a thirst for knowledge and wisdom....Sith or Jedi.

Another thing Roald Dahl could have been a star wars fan himself, Matilda was published in 1988 a time when the orginal trilogy was massive. He could of taken massive elements from star wars realised that he couldn't use them in a book and change the force to her intelligence last minute.

Complaints about him that would make him perfect for Star Wars:

**Too patriotic**: Uh . . . this is a damn war people, Star **WARS**. Patriotic might just help it a little bit. Though, someone will need to tell him no American Flags. And as for the actual war aspect, each trilogy is based off of a different war in history, with this guy around, you'll be able to more accurately portray that with Michael at the helm, or he could just come up with an entirely new one.

**Oversexualizes women**: This one may seem inevitable. He will be given constraints, and he will not pick the actors. However, he won't actually need too many of constraints, if anyone remembers in episode 6, Leia spent an entire scene in a friking bikini, I do not believe that Michael Bey can really get much worse than that. Realistically, more aliens in a massive universe would be making sexist jokes, adding a layer of realism to the Star Wars Universe. As for what the characters say and act like, he will have constrictions what he is and isn't allowed to do. Then there's the social media issue, to which I say, Suck It!

**Branding**: Disney does this already so its fine.

**Racist Jokes**: Uh . . . almost every alien race in Star Wars is a walking talking living racist joke already. I really don't think he could change much.

Complaints that could be easily fixed:

**Ruining Beloved Characters**: In my vision, Michael Bey will not have any control over beloved or pre-existing characters with exceptions that would make sense. He would have to create a new story with new characters in this already pre-existing universe. As for the canon, if it messes up the canon more than Rey did, it is non-canon. There, problem solved.

Things that he brings that would improve Star Wars:

**His unique ability to make the armies not complete idiots in his films**: He always makes military competent and grounded, something that has been lacking in Star Wars since the beginning. (Storm troopers can't shoot/ Haldo) By making both sides competent, he could add another layer of realism.

**Special Effects**: This goes without saying. He's a special effects wizard.

What he won't be able to do:

**Choose actors.**

**Write Script.**

**Use beloved characters.**",Why I think that Michael Bey would be perfect for Star Wars

&amp;#x200B;

A group of 4 normal looking people are walking on a crowded street, with a smartphone-looking device guiding their way. One of them asks ""are you sure we're in the right place?"" and another guy simply nods and keeps walking.

They soon arrive to what looks like a third-world car mechanic shop from the outside, but peering in, they sense something: the place is immaculate, with cars and tools precisely placed where they are supposed to be and what looks like a special project, hidden in the middle of it. This could be it, they say.

They start walking around the shop, looking at all things, but when they get close to this special project, one of them produces a photo that looks strikingly similar to what they're seeing with their own eyes. ""This is where it begins"", one of them says.

One of the 4 guys turns to see two plastic toys on a shelf. There's no doubt: it's R2D2 and BB-8. He grabs them and then the owner approaches and asks the guy what is he doing with those toys and if he can help them all with anything.

They look at the owner and point at his special project in the shop and ask him: ""you're creating something very special there... can you tell us more about it?"". Just when the owner is about to tell them about his attempt to create an AI-driven, fully functional R2 unit from scratch, one of the 4 guys looks outside and see 3 very tall men.

""It's them! Let's get outta here!"", he says to the other 3.

Without missing a beat, all 4 step out of the shop, with the owner looking at them, baffled about the whole situation.

What came afterwards was a 3-car &amp; foot chases around town, with the 4 people split 2-1-1 being followed by the very tall men. Eventually the 4 manage to lose the very tall men and are reunited in a sketchy hotel in a sketchy part of town.

I’ve made posts in here defending Luke before and why I think his characterization made sense in TLJ, but that’s not even what I’m trying to argue here. I think the reason why he was “different” matters a lot more then how he was different. It seemed what Rian was trying to do with Luke was convey themes of failure and owning up to your own mistakes and that the past will always catch up to you. He was trying to show Luke in a way that we could all relate to. Basically, the reason why Luke was conveyed the way he was important to the story and helped showcase some important themes and messages that stuck with me and a lot of other people. So I may never be able to convince someone that Luke was portrayed fairly, but I think the reason why he was portrayed the way he was is important, which I think matters a lot more then how he ended up acted the way he did. 

What do you guys think?","As I’ve thought more about, I think the reason for “why” Luke was “different” in TLJ matters a lot more then “how”"

0,"I know that this is a pretty common realization/sentiment, but I just wanted to share my personal moment of realization with it.

I was rewatching the prequels recently and there are two moments that particularly illustrate how the Jedi had become blinded by their own hubris. The first occurs in Episode 1, when Mace Windu and Yoda are discussing the idea that the Sith may have Rosen again and are growing in power. Mace Windy's blind moment of pride is more subtle than the next example, but he States that he does not believe the Sith could have returned without the Jedi being aware of it. This implies that he believes the Jedi are too powerful/observant to have allowed this to slip by them.

Later in Episode 2 when Obi-Wan goes looking for Kamino, he searches the archives and speaks with a archivist about his confusion with the missing system and his belief that the records are incomplete. Now Obi-Wan has already earned a certain amount of respect and awareness for who he is within the order. But not only does the archivist dismiss the possibility that the records could be incomplete, she gets rather offended by it and states absolutely that ""if there is no record of something within our archives, then it does not exist"". Seeing this scene as a kid I just thought she was supposed to be some snooty librarian stereotype and that was that. But it is a prime example not only of the toxic hubris of the Jedi, but also how their attitudes have led them to stray towards the dark side unwittingly. For ""only a Sith deals in absolutes"", so no matter how outlandish a concept it may be, the archivist should have at least acknowledged the possibility that the archives could be missing some information if she was truly operating by the philosophy of the Jedi.

I know these are pretty popular and notable examples but it just struck me as I was rewatching the movies and fully understanding their significance for myself, how extremely layered and nuanced George Lucas crafted the first 6 episodes to be. It gives me new appreciation for movies that I have loved dearly for years.",The Sith were right about the Jedi in many ways
0,"      The Sequel Trilogy has many flaws, and the two that stick out are how the movies do not flow together as a trilogy as the OT and (sort of) the PT did, and TFA set up many questions, (who is Snoke, Rey’s parents, Luke’s status, among others) and TLJ seemed to have written it all off. Snoke was killed and did not have the role we thought he would in this trilogy, Rey came from nothing, and Luke was in fear after his failure w/ Ben. As much as we all criticized this, following the setups of TFA through the trilogy would have increased the fluidity of the story, yet (in my opinion) left a somewhat stale, similar rendition of the OT. If we take the twists and turns of TLJ and look at them in a positive light, they were trying to push the ST into a new story where there was not an overarching, orchestral villain, a main hero derived from power, and a mentor that had their weaknesses and needed guidance themselves. The third movie would’ve shown Kylo Ren as he faces is actions and must decide where his destiny lies, and Rey, who must  earn her place in the saga. Opinions on what could’ve fixed the ST and whether TLJ or RoS should have differed, and why? Obviously these movies were janky af, but I’d love to hear other input.",The Last Jedi might not have been all that bad...

0,"Watching Episode 3 now. This was the movie that got me into Star Wars when I saw it when I was 11, so it’s automatically my favorite. 

This scene just passed and it got me thinking, would things have changed at all if Anakin joined Windu at first? I personally don’t think so. It seems like Anakin’s fear of losing Padme and anger towards the Jedi and their lack of trust in him would’ve still caused him to turn. I do wonder if he would have had the guts to fight the chancellor in that scene, say if he would’ve been with Mace and the others in that scene. My gut says no, since I think he would still want to save him (Chancellor) to learn the power to save Padme.

Mace not letting Anakin join him wasn’t right, in my opinion. I would’ve been pissed off too. If I were Anakin, I just uncovered a huge secret that could save the galaxy, and I’m told to step aside? Without much thanks? By a man who seemed to have it out for me? I’d be a bit angry too.

ESB: Luke loses a limb-It’s replaced shortly afterwards, Han gets frozen-Nah he’s fine by the end of the first act of the next movie, Hyperdrive is FUBAR-Deus ex R2 fixes it with a huge ass pull.

ROTJ: Luke goes to strike Palpatine-Vader stops him, Ewoks about to kill everyone-C-3PO stops them, Luke attacks Vader-Stops and is almost killed by Palpatine, in fact Vader kills Palpatine.

But I hate when People say that this movie ""went on and did it's own Thing, by not answering every question set up in the force Awakens"".
Like, thats not how it works. The Last Jedi connects to the force Awakens incredibly well, it answers the some of the biggest questions set up in TFA (Reys parents is a good example) and leave plenty of Mystery for Episode IX.

Where the story of this trilogy becomes uncohesive is TRoS. Now, i like this movie. But it. Is. Flawed.
It feels very reactionary, and decided that instead of being it's own movie, it was going to be both 8 and 9

Leading to a twist that i HATE. Snoke was created by Palpatine. But, this is beyond my point. We could have gotten an Episode IX that answered the questions left behind by The Last Jedi, while still having a fun and enjoyable story, instead of being what we got (albeit still a good movie) People Wouldnt complain, that Rian Johnson just went in his own Direction, and ignored everything else.

As someone who read The Duel of the Fates script, im really sad that we didn't get it, as it followed The Last Jedi's story and ended the trilogy in a really satisfying way. Although it had some errors and plot holes, this is excusable since it was most likely the first draft, as it wasnt to be filmed for another 13 months, so it was to go through some rewrites

0,"There are already so many tie-in promotional things that the game has done to coincide with recent Star Wars releases, and I believe even Dave Filoni worked on either a storyline or some lore within the game.

I believe that since the era the game takes place is so far removed from eras depicted in the films that it wouldn’t be much of a hassle to integrate everything into canon.

Imagine the massive “canonization party” that would be held if the news comes that SWTOR is getting canonized. The game has numerous singleplayer campaigns all packed into one free-to-play game. 

Once people get wind that the stories and characters presented in the game now hold actual canonical weight, I think hoards of fans would flock to it. Not only the MMO but the original two Knights of the Old Republic games as well.

0,"I know there is a lot of disagreement on whether or not people liked the sequels, but I think everyone can agree they are extremely disjointed and don't mesh well together. The Force Awakens was basically a remake of A New Hope, but it set the stage well for a new trilogy with lots of interesting characters. The Last Jedi (BY ITSELF) was a great movie, but Rian Johnson didn't give two shits about Star Wars lore and he basically threw out a lot of what JJ Abrams set up in The Force Awakens.. he rebooted the reboot. The Rise of Skywalker is a convoluted mess that is impossible to follow without reading the accompanying novel, and it felt like watching literal fan fiction. 

Kathleen Kennedy deserves the blame for all of this. How in the world do you start a new trilogy without adhering to some kind of greater narrative!! Rian Johnson took a lot of shit but the guy had free rein to make his own movie. He made a good movie, but it didn't fit with the larger story. That's not his fault, it's Kennedy's. Then after the controversy that followed, JJ Abrams releases a fan service mess that was just trying to clean up after The Last Jedi. Kennedy is responsible for all of this. She should be guiding the stories, and should have taken greater control over the scripts. The crazy part is she DID step in on Solo and Episode IX by firing the directors because they ""didn't fit the Star Wars brand,"" but I cant for the life of me understand what she was talking about! Colin Treverow's leaked script was so much better the The Rise of Skywalker, and it didn't throw out the good parts of the Last Jedi. It would have felt much more cohesive than what actually came out. 

It's so frustrating because each movie had tons of positives on their own, but none of them fit together. It's like they reset the drawing board after each movie, rather than laying out a plan from the beginning and following it. All of that is 100% Kennedy's fault, and I can't understand why she didn't take more of the backlash. Most of it seemed to fall on the directors, but it isn't their job to ""protect"" Star Wars canon.

I just watched solo - a star wars story, and was confused about the make up of the imperial ground army. How did ground forces go from mostly normal people, in a world war 1 kind of battle, to only storm troopers in episode 4? There isn't that much time between them. Then the original trilogy only has stormtroopers (I think) which are all clones, then in the newer trilogy they aren't clones any more, but are still dressed as storm troopers? Why aren't they dressed in normal military attire in the new trilogy?  

Am I missing something? These seem to be major jumps in the composition of the army, that changes at the top probably wouldn't have much of an effect on?

0,"On the internet all the time when people talk about sequels they hate on it so much. I am here to convince you that sequels are the best star wars trilogy. Let's talk about the story, because it's the most important aspect of movies (at least I think so). In sequels we met a troubled scavenger - Rey - that cannot find her place in the world until she finds a ressistance droid BB8 and ""ressistance spy"" Finn (or so she thought). Finn himself was a stormtrooper not being able to see his friends suffer so he finally snaps and frees Poe Dameron (that goes missing after that). He doesn't really know who to trust, but he needs to eventually rely on Rey. Together they try to deliver the droid back to ressistance. Before it happens Rey gets captured by Kylo Ren and therefore Finn ""loses"" another important person in his life. At least he finds his old friend Poe. In pursuit of our female scavenger Finn together with Han and Chewbacca fly to the Starkiller Base. They find Rey but then Han that dies in the hands of his son - Ben Solo also known as Kylo Ren. Eventually Finn tries to fight Ben but gets damaged. Now this is a part that people get angry about. Rey with the use of a lightsaber and the force defeats Kylo even tough she didn't ever showcase such abilities. Because of it she is considered a Mary Sue, but she gives people hope. She is really the same as Super Man. She is the daughter of Palpatine and so she deserves such power. Then Starkiller Base gets destroyed and ressistance completes the map to Luke Skywalker. Rey travels to him and the great Jedi Master suposedly isn't behaving like he should. But he behaves exactly like Yoda. He goes into exile when he's needed. He doesn't want to help, but a friend of his tells him that he should do it. He teaches the new Jedi recruit of the ways of the force, even tough there are doubts coming out of this Jedi's past (not really known at this point with Rey). Then this Jedi needs to fly to the rescue of their friends. Exactly the same. He tries to do it to much as it may be visible. Prequels tried to do something new that didn't really succed. Sequels deliver recreation of original trilogy a lot better than ever with fixes to the story of original trilogy and significantly special effects.

The story is about people who have problems to find their place in the galaxy. It doesn't try to do something new, but it does something like a ""remake"" of the old movies.",Sequels are the best star wars trilogy

0,"So I think the biggest reason for the divide in the fan base with Rey and whether or not she should have to be somebody is because TFA did such a poor job of making its own characters.

From the rehashed planets (Jakku=Tattoine, Starkiller base=Hoth, Takodana=Endor) to a rehashed Cantina to Maz being a pseudo Yoda, the biggest thing they did was set up Rey with all of Anakin and Luke’s attributes.

1. They made her a scavenger and mechanic
2. They made her an excellent pilot
3. They made her have God mode powers with little effort
4. Growing up on a desert planet

You can’t force (pun intended) that many traits into a character based on two HUGE characters in the saga and then say they’re nobody, specifically not in the lineage of those same characters.

Had they simply tweaked her background as far as what type of planet she’s from, give her some other skills than being a mechanic and pilot (perhaps a weapon forger who made her staff?) and set up her parents from the beginning, then I think it would make more sense and distance the assumptions from her being related to Ani/Luke.

0,"Something I haven’t seen discussed as much is the drastic difference between the fighting styles of Kylo Ren and the redeemed Ben Solo. Rewatching the KoR battle we see Ben implementing a more fluid ,graceful ,fighting style , opposite to the feral , brutal  blade work of Kylo Ren . I think the difference  is both indicative of the very distinct personas of Ben and Kylo informing their blade work and the idolization of the equally ( if not more so) distinct personalities of the grandfather that inspired him.

    Kylo  Ren’s style of fighting was in my own view ,very reminiscent of Vader but there is a distinction that puts Vader above Ren and . Vader religiously applies powerful strikes filled with savagery , yet it was focus that truly made Vader a dangerous duelist. The Dark One interchangeably employ raged filled barrages and clinical , calculated blade work . Ren due to his erratic nature cannot employ this and so he gets carried away and rages , thus adopting a poor approximation of Vader that lacks in finesse.

  Ben on the other hand, moves similar to a prequel era Jedi, twirling saber and fancy blocks ,fighting as if a weight had lifted off of his shoulders. Solo moved with a fluidity and confidence  that was a delight to watch . It was very Anakin-esque, in the way that he moved ,powerful  in the sense that you could feel the strength of his blows but still containing a grace to temper it.  I just wish we got to see more

I have the book by the same author for ""The Last Jedi"" and it ends with a very detailed description of the fight on Crait (minus the Luke standoff), ending with concept art for Luke levitating on the rock and finally with broom boy.  


In this book, they spend quite a bit of time on the ""Oracle"" who lives on a cooled off Mustafar. But there's not a single mention or concept of Palpatine, his throne, or the Sith chamber on Exagol. It just feels odd that they'd suddenly become concerned about spoilers--if that was the reason why--when they revealed Palpatine in April last year, well before the film was even out.  


You'd think they'd have enough time to pull together some concept art for the final battle of the Saga films? And the evolution of Palpatine's throne room seems like it would be a pretty big deal.

0,"I posted this once when the Blu-ray came out, paraphrasing the quote, but here's the exact quote from the featurette.

“In the first trilogy, the hardest thing Luke could be told in that moment was that Vader was his father. It turns everything on its head for Luke, it takes away all the easy answers and make him face the hardest thing, which is that ‘I no longer have just a bad guy I can hate; suddenly the thing that I thought was the bad guy’s actually a part of me.’ For Rey, I think it's the exact opposite. If she were told that she's related to this person or Luke is her this or whatever, that would be the easiest thing she could hear, that’s everything she wants, that would instantly define what her place is in this universe. So to me, the equivalent of ‘I am your father’ is ‘Nope you gotta stand on your own two feet, there are not going to be those easy answers here for you. You're wondering who you are? Okay, well you have to find out who you are for yourself.’”

Watching this featurette back in 2018, it really set into my mind the brilliance of Rey being a nobody. In all fairness though, finding out Palpatine is your grandpa isn't an easy answer, but as far as a story line goes I think Rian had it right. After a trilogy of Luke being born into this family and being the only one who could save Darth Vader, and a trilogy of Anakin being the Chosen One, I was very excited to have the antagonist be predestined into an inclination for the Dark Side while the protagonist made their own path. I will always mourn the loss of Rian's greatest contribution to the sequel trilogy.",Rian Johnson’s take on the importance of Rey being a nobody
0,"Lately, the Star Wars movies have been, to put it mildly, a bit uninspired. Rebels vs Empire, Jedi vs Sith, occasionally a Death Star thrown in the mix, often with classic OT characters in major roles. (That's not to say they're all bad... They're just not really treading new ground for the franchise.) And a lot of fan suggestions tend to follow the same patterns, with the addition of Legends adaptions thrown into the mix.

With that in mind, I wanted to hear the community's most creative and outside-the-box ideas for Star Wars films.

A couple examples of my own:

**The Elderblade**  
The Jedi believed that every Kyber Crystal was alive. Some more than others. Long ago, a Jedi Master sought eternal life and stored his consciousness within a crystal. A young man who is strong in the Force but undisciplined finds himself drawn to a mysterious relic. A lightsaber from ages past. Through this saber, the ancient being within can guide its wielder, and the wielder can even channel the skills and abilities of the crystal within as if they were their own. But there are others who seek the Blade as well, who will stop at nothing to obtain its powers. And as the boy channels more of the Jedi's abilities, he begins to question who is really in control, and if the master within has an agenda of his own.

**The Droidmaker's Daughter**  
The Force flows through all living things. After the Clone Wars, droids were hated and reviled through much of the Galaxy. The Empire forbid advancements in droid technology, and the New Republic carried over many of these restrictions. But not everyone shares these prejudices. A lonely Droidmaker lives within the far reaches of the Outer Rim, far away from the rest of the Galaxy, with only his Droids to keep him company, conducting experiments that many would consider unnatural. However, his Droids are no substitute for actual human contact, and he wants nothing more than to have a child of his own. Defying every law and regulation, the Droidmaker creates his greatest masterpiece. A daughter crafted of metal on the inside, but appearing human on the outside, who can learn and grow as a person. And even, most frighteningly, access the Force itself. A true living Droid. But when word of her father's experiments reaches the world beyond, she has to run and hide within a galaxy that would hate and fear her if it knew what she really was. A galaxy which her very existence could forever alter.",What are your most outside-the-box Star Wars movie pitches?
0,"Jedis are supposed to be special because the force lets them slow their perception of time right? That’s why they can fight the way they do and why non jedis are generally not a threat to them unless in great numbers.

But you have this random guy who can’t use the force but is able to kill several jedis in duels. I don’t think him having multiple arms/sabers has anything to do with it because 1) he didn’t start out with 4 lightsabers he started with 1 and got more as he killed more Jedi and 2) I don’t see how a four limbed enemy would make much of a difference to Jedi who can deflect laser blasts coming from all directions with seemingly no trouble unless they are caught off guard (like during order 66).",How was General Grievous able to duel and win against jedis?
0,"So I watched TLJ again the other day. Afterwards I realized that the lesson he learned in ROTJ is the same as in tlj. So Luke realizes that he should not follow the Jedi code 100%, and that’s how he was able to redeem his father. He was going to rebuild a new Jedi order. In tlj, he abandons his attachment to Kyle for a split second, and has a fleeting thought of killing him. This obviously was a mistake, but he already learned not to do that. If you say that he was letting his fear guide him instead, then he just forgot his training for no reason. By the end he thinks someone should rebuild the Jedi order, even thought that’s what he was already supposed to do!? Am I looking at this wrong?",Why does Luke learn the same lesson twice?
0,"I would definitely say yes. Andy Circus brought so much to the character, and I think he would’ve made an awesome main villain for the trilogy.

Ian McDiarmid stole the show every time he was on screen, so I was happy to see Palpatine again. The problem was *how* they explained his return and that it wasn’t foreshadowed at all. The only subtle hint I can remember, is in TLJ when I heard Palpatine’s theme at some point. I can’t remember when that was, but I know I heard it.

Snoke could’ve easily been written back into TROS. Maybe cloning force sensitive beings was his discovery, and that’s why he was able to live. It also would’ve made killing him and destroying Exogol way more important. 

**THE NEW PLOT**

Here could’ve been an interesting plot. Snoke wants to create a pair of powerful force sensitive apprentices, but he needs Rey and Kylo on Exegol to do it. To do that, he bridges their minds again so that they come together to destroy him. So the first act is to establish Snoke’s goal on Exegol, and show what Rey and Kylo have been up to and bridge their minds for the first time. 

The second act would be them both hunting for the one Sith Wayfinder at the same time to find Snoke. Rey brings Poe, Finn, Chewie and Threepio to help her. When they find it, the same thing happens then when they fought on the Death Star wreckage. Rey stabs Ben and Leia gives up her life to save Ben Solo. Rey and the rest of her buddies separate, so her and Ben travel to Exegol to face Snoke. 

The third act plays out decently similarly from the movie, except that Rey and Ben go in together and fight off Snoke together. Poe and Finn are tasked with stealing a First Order Dreadnought or one of those planet killing star destroyer things to destroy Exegol with. They win the day, Exegol is destroyed, and Ben and Rey both survive. They split up since the Resistance would probably hang Ben, but they meet up in the future on Tatooine to bury Luke and Leia’s sabers. They stare off into the binary sunset and boom, movie over.

I think this would’ve been way clearer and less disgusting lore-wise than what we got. Rey is still a nobody, but she becomes a Skywalker when she hooks up with Rey. Finn and Poe get something cool to do by stealing a Dreadnought, and we don’t have to bring back any dead characters besides Snoke.",Could Snoke have been the main villain of TROS instead of Palpatine?
0,"So I'm almost finished with ROTS novelization and honestly, it's an amazing book. Never read another Star Wars book (since I was like, 10, anyways) and it was phenomenal. However, I just finished the end of the Obi-Wan/Anakin &amp; Yoda/Sidious fights, and goodness those were some of the shortest, most rushed through fights I've read through in a book.

0,"There's been a lot said about this scene but the most prevalent from one side seems to be that because Luke already 'had' his character development in ROTJ by saving Vader, and that's negated and inconsistent with his actions in TLJ in trying to kill Kylo. 

I always from day one interpreted it as even peak Luke as a Jedi Master, having experienced his trials and tribulations in the OT and more, was shaken to the core by what he saw in Ben - enough so that the only rational ultimatum was to kill him. He even states that the darkness growing in Ben was no match for him which justifies his lapse in judgement and blatant panic. A mistake that was momentous enough for him to self-impose himself until he was found by Rey. Was that not the case?",Question on the Luke's attempt on Kylo/Ben in TLJ

0,"CG have clearly caised a massive disruption in the community with these Galactic Legends. They hyped up a pathetic event that brought us stupidly powerful characters that undermined every team in the game. Not only does it put our commitment down the drain, but its ultimately shown that they've wasted their time and money on all the other characters and teams!

Aside from this, very few people were fussed about getting a GL Rey and Kylo. It is sadly sort of protocal for a gane like SWGOH to realease content on the new movies. Yet, they don't seem to want to release content on the new TV shows. The Mandalorian for example has been extremely successful and came out way before TROS. They would have made a truck load of money from the community because everyone loves the mandalorian and probably would have gaimed a little more respect from the community. Instead, they released unwanted content that proved nothing else exclet the fact that they do not listen to their community and are frankly incredibly lazy.

I remember there being a lot of ads for Lego Star Wars 3 on billboards and different places throughout the game. I don't remember a whole lot about it, but there was a ""PVP"" element to it. Two teams, red and blue, would be chosen and you would have to fight other player to get brick from them. You would then navigate up to the top of a tower with your brick and place it on a flag thingy. The first team to build the flag on top of their base would win.

0,"I’ve always been confused at the sentiment on Reddit and in the Star Wars fandom in general. Where it tries to portray the Jedi Order as the “bad guys” and “the reason why Anakin fell”. 

If anything, they were right, and Anakin not following their teachings is the reason why he even fell to the Dark Side. 

Contrary to popular opinion, the Jedi do NOT force you to suppress your emotions. They merely teach you to control them. You can laugh, be sad, be happy and even form attachments. 

The original Jedi Code is this, and is taught to younglings. 

&gt;Emotion, yet peace.

&gt;Ignorance, yet knowledge.

&gt;Passion, yet serenity.

&gt;Chaos, yet harmony.

&gt;Death, yet the Force.

Portraying Jedi as emotion suppressing virgins is just plain wrong and ignorant. 

Now let’s get into the topic of love. 

The Jedi Order forbids attachment and possession, the reason they do this is quite reasonable.

If you’re a Jedi, and your wife and children get kidnapped and murdered by a Sith Lord. You will obviously be filled with rage, for a trained Force Sensitive, rage means the Dark Side. 

In the context of the Star Wars Universe, the Dark Side is always **BAD**. It turns you into a power hungry psychopath and must be resisted at all costs. 

So what happened when the ONE Jedi who decided not to follow the code? He became one of, if not the most evil men to ever exist. Darth Vader. 

The portrayal of the Jedi Order as bad is plain ignorant, and most importantly **wrong** in my humble opinion. 

They have served the Galaxy well, and have kept peace for over a thousand years before Palpatine took over.","Unpopular Opinion: The Jedi Order were right, and are the greatest thing to ever happen to the Galaxy."

0,"Just wondering why there's so much hate directed towards Rian Johnson. To me he was the only person who actually tried to push Star Wars in a forward direction instead of clinging desperately to the past and nostalgia. In my opinion one of the best scenes from the entire trilogy was at the end of TLJ when Kylo Ren said ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It's the only way to become who you were meant to be."" I believe he was being kinda meta as well about the Star Wars franchise as a whole. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I believe The Last Jedi was the only movie to actually use some of the ideas George Lucas (or Lucasfilms) originally had for a sequel trilogy before Lucasfilms was bought by Disney. I'm not saying The Last Jedi isn't without it's flaws but honestly it's the only movie of the sequel trilogy that I'll be rewatching anymore.

0,"I've know about the rule of two for a while now but it doesn't make sense to me, cuz in episode one there are 3 with active Plageius, Sidious, and Maul who was technically an assassin but is still classified as a sith. I use to think the three were Sidious, Dooku, and Maul but found out Dooku wasnt under palpatine until sometime between episode 1 and 2.

Anyways, can there be technically more than 2 with at a time and the rule of two just means 2 sith lords? Because in episode 6, which the rule of two was most likely not around at the time, Palpatine was trying to get Luke to become his new apprentice, would that have ment Palpatine would've killed Vader or simply kept them both would he have succeeded?

0,"1: His fighting style. While Palpy wanted to corrupt Anakin to replace Dooku, Dooku wanted Obi-Wan as his own apprentice. As to why? Dooku, as seen in TCW when he ridicules Savage and in the mini-series with Grievous, prefers refinement, control and precision over raw ability since he's a master of form 2. Which means Anakin was not the ideal apprentice for him as we see his dueling abilities are very good but still sloppy. Dooku would prefer Kenobi, who mastered the MOST controlled fighting style. In RotS, most people say Anakin should have won, but someone like Dooku looks at it and says, ""Of course Kenobi won, he was fighting smart while Skywalker was sloppy and out of control.""

2: How their fighting styles compared to Palpy's. I think Palpy was a master or form 6, which is weak against 2, the style Dooku used. Kenobi used form 3, which is strong against every form. Compare that to Maul and Savage, who both use 7, which is weak against 6. Maul and Savage obviously lost, but did respectably. Kenobi and Dooku together might have stood a better chance than them and maybe better than Anakin and Dooku.

3: His ability. I've already says Dooku prefers refinement over raw strength. But Kenobi has both, and Dooku knows he chopped Maul in half. At that point he'd heard of Anakin, but he'd never chopped a Sith in half.

4: Okay, this actually does have something to do with Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon wasn't as straight-edged as other Jedi, and Kenobi was his apprentice, so it would be safe to assume Kenobi was the same (the assumption was mostly incorrect, but it was a safe guess)",The four real reasons Dooku wanted Kenobi as his apprentice (And it wasn't because of Qui-Gon)
0,"Different people like different things, I get that. That's life, you know, some people like the Sequels, others are wrong (it's a joke!). But when it comes to Thrawn, there seems to be almost universal appreciation on this sub!

So, being the SW fan that I am, I rushed to my local library to pick the first Thrawn novel up, and I HATED it. I'm probably (almost definitely) overreacting, but I really didn't like it at all. I forced my self just over halfway through, before I had to put it down, because I couldn't stand Thrawn as a character anymore.

He knows everything, he sees everything, he is smarter than everybody, better than everybody at everything. In fact, I cared more about Arihnda's story line than that of our oh so beloved Chiss, because at least she had some conflict. But Thrawn, not so much.

""Oh, I can see that these Fighters are flying slightly weirdly sometimes, therefore they must be controlled from the ground."" Like, what? Where did that even come from?

""Culoss sounds similar to Q-less, therefore they must be members of this specific 'cult' of criminals."" That makes no sense at all!

""I will fight this self-defense-instructor in this unique fighting style, which I of course know, so I can silently obtain information just by looking at how the others react."" Come on now.

Admittedly, I am rambling at this point. And I will say, the writing style of Timothy Zahn was fine. It is the person Thrawn that I dislike so much.

And so, looking at other peoples posts on here makes it pretty obvious that I am just not getting it, which brings me back to my title-question.

A couple of years ago I lost my girlfriend suddenly and unexpectedly. In my most grief riddled moments I turned to the galaxy far, far away. I was watching one movie or another. 

I met my current girlfriend about 6 months after that loss. I, more or less, introduced her to the wide array of Star Wars. Before we started dating she said she wanted to watch the prequels but we spent all night talking while The Phantom Menace was in the background. We've seen every film since then, and The Mandalorian. We've seen every film since The Last Jedi opening night. 

The Earth is in a rough place right now. I'm trying to stay strong but it's hard. All in all... I'm real scared. My girlfriend already has anxiety and infrequent panic attacks so I'm doing my best to put on a brave face for her. Luckily, we're both still employed. 

Unluckily, only she can work from home. I have a weird schedule. After Monday, I'm off until Thursday, and then have Friday Saturday and Sunday off. But after that I'm on the clock for roughly 8 days. I call these days my long stretch.

0,"Okay let me first start off with that I admire Obi wan and his cunning mind and strategies, but while I was rewatching the show to get to the new season 7, I saw him do something that could've given the Republic a huge advantage in the war.

As a recap of the episode the Younglings are resucing Asoka from the pirates on Flourim  and Obi wan is busy fighting a space battle with General Grievous. 

General Grivous manages to get on obi wans ship with droids and are killing everything in sight. Obi wan calls a retreat and everyone is evacuating to the escape pods with a plan to blow up the ship with Grivious on it. As everyone is getting off, Grivious is on the bridge with droids searching for the data banks to steal information from the ship and use for the Separatist army. Suddenly a recorded message of Obi wan plays WARNING GRIEVOUS OF THE SHIP ABOUT TO BLOW UP! Grievous runs to his ship and gets off just as the whole cruiser blows up. If Obi Wan hadn't have done that then he would've won the republic a huge win and save countless of lives for the future and maybe even win the war.",S5 E8 Obi Wans horrible mistake

I love this community and thought it would be best to share with you my situation. 

I am in search for my Jedi name. I would like this name to have the first name begin with the letter R, and the last name begin with the letter W.

I am a Jedi Knight from the state of Wisconsin who studies the ways of the force in Production Engineering. I am on the road to become a master Jedi with a focus in Engineering Management where I will receive my six sigma black belt. 

I have chosen to transition my religious beliefs to studying and following the Jedi Texts and scriptures and ways of the force. My new tangible object for a higher power is currently Yoda’s force ghost. 

Love it, thank you all, I look forward to receiving my authentic Jedi title. 

Best.

Some of you are Buddhists, or you've studied Buddhism.  Most of you know where George Lucas derived the Jedi religion.

Some of us have adopted principles from the Jedi religion for ourselves, or in my case, have been practicing the religion/philosophy from which the Jedi religion is inspired.  So by coincidence.

And great Jedi games like Fallen Order, the first Force Unleashed, etc. have kept true to the saga.  We can play Jedi, with their ""real"" (you know what I mean) powers.

0,"This is basically how I pictured the Force Unleashed would go down in the new Disney timeline. 

The events more or less happen the same, but with a few adjustments for the new canon timeline. 

We open on Darth Vader arriving on Kashyyk hunting down a rogue Jedi master who’s rumored to be hiding a group of padawans who survived Order 66. He locates the master and kills them, and finds the padawans, all around fifteen years old. Among them was a padawan with shaggy black hair named Galen Marek. 

Vader took the children and inducted them into the inquisitor program for five years. Their job was the hunt down and kill any Jedi they locate. Galen was placed as the First Brother of the Inquisitors. He’s also referred to as “Starkiller”. 

Each of the new inquisitors gets their own training droid, and Galen’s is known as Proxy, a droid who short-circuited and developed the personality of a cheerful sociopath whose prime directive is to kill him. 

Galen is assigned to a young pilot named Juno Eclipse, who will be flying him and his men to their missions. 

The rest of the story follows relatively similarly to the original: 

*Galen hunts down Rahm Kota

*Galen hunts down Kazdan Paratus

*Galen hunts down Shaak Ti

*Vader fakes Galen’s death in order to trick the Emperor into thinking he’s dead

*Vader orders Galen to start a rebellion in order to destabilize the Empire just enough so that he could kill the Emperor

*Galen rescues Juno, then grabs Proxy and they all head out on the Rogue Shadow

*They find Rahm Kota on Nar Shaddaa

*They travel to Kashyyk to free the Wookiee’s and convince Bail Organa, and his daughter Leia, to join the Rebellion. Galen is forced to kill one of his fellow inquisitors, though, and it destroys him to do so. 

*They travel to Felucia to rescue Mon Montha from Marris Brood

*Galen meets with Vader again, and he is told to destroy a Star Destroyer construction facility on Raxus Prime

*Juno overhears this and accuses Galen of being loyal to Vader

*They travel to Raxus Prime to destroy a Star Destroyer construction facility. Proxy now tries to kill Galen by taking Darth Maul’s form. 

*Galen defeats Proxy and destroys be facility, but be doesn’t pull a Star Destroyer out of the sky

*Organa meets with Mon Montha and a few other senators on Corellia in order to officially start the rebellion. Vader kidnaps al of them, and reveals to Galen that this was all a front to lure out the Empire’s enemies. 

*Vader tries to kill Galen, but Proxy sacrifices himself to save him. 

*Galen and Juno track Vader and the senators to the Death Star, and he kills his way through the space station, killing a few of his fellow inquisitors in the process

*Galen finally faces Vader and after a long duel defeats him, then he meets the Emperor. 

Galen and Kota work together to beat the Emperor while the others escape. Kota escapes too, but Galen stays behind. A massive force lightning explosion happens, and Galen is nearly killed. 

On Kashyyk, the senators all agree to found the rebellion. 

Meanwhile, Vader and Sidious both repair Galen as best as they can and make him into their own personal assassin, similar to Ventress. However, the suit he wears is as painful as Vader’s, with the suit forcing him to breathe instead of allowing him to do so.

0,"Hey all, with the release of the massive 27-disc boxset happening in just TWO DAYS (3/31), I wanted to know your thoughts on it! I know there are those who DEEPLY care about the theatrical release of the OT, and those who don't really buy physical media and stream instead. Would you purchase this set? Have you already purchased this set? Would you purchase the set if there were things different about it? If you buy digitally, what are your thoughts on that and why you buy digitally?

For me, I got a too excited and placed my preorder, but I'm a little iffy and on the fence of cancelling/ keeping. This would be my first go at buying physical movies (except for all the bootlegs at local restaurants haha), which is mainly due to me liking the convenience of digital media being all in one place; but I know that quality of digital is worse than that of physical due to compression. I am also upset that it doesn't include Rogue One, but ultimately buying the boxset is cheaper than buying all 9 physical copies + Rogue One. Also, if I were to buy the films digitally, iTunes doesn't even have them in 4K! So I'd have to go with another service like VUDU, which in my opinion has more of a risk of shutting down than Apple services. Maybe I'm being too picky about quality (especially with this being my first go at physical movies), and with them being 4K on Disney+, does it really matter?

0,"Was rewatching The Phantom Menace the other day and this quote got me thinking. How much did this advice impact Anakin as a Jedi? This is the very first advice Anakin receives from Qui-Gon Jinn on how to use the Force before the pod race.

Anakin must have really taken that to heart because what does he do throughout the rest of the prequels? Choose to follow his feelings rather than adhere to Jedi instruction regarding love and attachment.  There was a whole list of reason why Anakin turned to the dark side (mother’s death, the council’s distrust towards him, Ahsoka’s betrayal, etc.) but Qui Gon’s advice effectively set the tone for Anakin’s path as a Jedi.

0,"One thing I think that often gets forgotten is the academic side of the Jedi order. Padawans and younglings don’t solely train to be lightsaber duelists and force masters for 20-25 years. They have regular school that probably takes up half the time. The Clone Wars is not a good example of how Jedi training typically goes. Jedi aren’t usually generals and their pubescent padawans aren’t usually commanders. Cal Kestis was like 10 years old training on a war ship in the middle of a war. That’s not normal.

Before TCW, there was galactic peace. That means the academics would have been more of a focus on raising Jedi up. The Jedi before the clone wars would have been philosophers, archaeologists, paleontologists, scientists, historians, professors, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, politicians, musicians, etc. when there is no war, the liberal arts and STEM education can flourish. And so a lot of jedi training would have consisted of eduction. In fact, I bet half of all Youngling and padawan training was regular school work. 

I believe I read somewhere that there is going to be a new jedi in the HR era that views the Force through music. And so she would be a musician. Maybe she plays music to help her mediate and feel more in tune with the Force? It could really cool to see how other jedi combine their professions and their view on the Force. 

The Jedi Order weren’t the most famous and influential organization in the galaxy for no reason. They shaped galactic history. You can’t do that with just churning out people with their only abilities being swinging a lightsaber around and using the Force. So whenever we do get to the High Republic era, I really hope we see Jedi being more than how they’ve always been portrayed as fighters.",Something I want to see in the High Republic era is new Jedi professions
0,"First of all, I know this is a thoroughly discussed topic, but here's my two cents, anyway.

So in current canon, the colour of a Jedi's lightsaber crystal is determined by its wielder's ""spiritual alignment"", i.e. its colourless until chosen by/choosing a Jedi. 

Meaning its likely that the majority of lightsabers were blue or green because those colours most closely aligned with the popular values of the Jedi order. So, with that being said, I think the meaning of the lightsaber colours are...

BLUE: The most common lightsaber colour, usually displayed by the most knight-like members of the Order. Their values are centred around bravery, determination and honour.

GREEN: The runner-up for most common colour, seems to be wielded by scholars and those who value wisdom, cleverness, and being open to the Force above all else.

RED: In canon, caused by a dark-side user directing their raw, negative emotions into a (previously attuned?) crystal to corrupt or ""bleed"" it, causing it to turn red regardless of its original colour.

YELLOW: Fairly rare, only present in canon in the hands of the Jedi temple guards, and later, Rey. My guess is that these colour is aligned with those who value vigilance and the proactive protection of others, possibly specifically of the Order itself. This is possibly shown with Rey, who at the time of *Rise of Skywalker,* is essentially protecting the entire future of the Jedi Order single-handedly.

PURPLE: Mace Windu is the only canon wielder of a purple lightsaber. So based off his traits, it seems that purple attunes to those who value the use of aggressive, even darker tactics in service of the greater good. Possibly related to purple being a combination of blue and red.

WHITE: In canon, results only from the purification of a previously ""bled"" (red) crystal. Possibly represents a neutral alignment with the force.

LIME GREEN/YELLOW-GREEN: Ahsoka Tano's original off-hand shoto lightsaber was this colour, likely a combination of green and yellow values. Maybe something entirely different.

BLUE-WHITE: Tera Sinube's lightsaber-cane was this colour. No idea what it means. Could maybe represent greater independence from the Jedi. 

So that's it (I think). What are your thoughts on the meaning of the colours, or do you prefer if the colours are completely random?",Lightsaber Colours

0,"I've been rewatching the series so I can catch up to the final season before it ends. Ever since I first watched The Clone Wars, I always thought the ""Mortis"" arc was arguably my favorite of the series. However, after just finishing the ""Umbara"" arc, I might have to change my mind. It might change as I continue to watch the series, but the ""Umbara"" arc is so far the best arc in the series. It's fucking amazing from beginning to end. 

I feel it's one of the few arcs in the series that really shows you how intense the war is. A lot of times, in the series, you see the battle happening, but you usually don't see it completely from the perspective of the clones because they are overshadowed by the Jedi characters. This arc flips that around and places the story completely from the perspective of the soldiers and how brutal it can be in the war. This is one of my favorite stories in the entire Star Wars franchise. I feel it's so important in terms of characterization for the clone troopers, but also showing firsthand that the Jedi are not so ""mighty and morally good"" as the prequel trilogy makes them out to be. 

I think it's arguable that this is the darkest that the series got. I mean, this arc really touches upon some messed up and complex topics. Krell tricking the clone's into killing one another might be one of the most fucked up moments in Star Wars canon. There's very few ""sad"" moments in the Star Wars franchise that really hit me, personally. However, that moment always gets to me. It's so raw and tragic. Also, just Dogma's tragic reaction to killing Krell, and then ending the arc off by leaving the viewer with the question of ""what is the fate of clones once the war is over and their job is done?"". Just an amazingly done story that I feel showcases almost everything that I love about the series.",I've changed my mind on what I consider to be the best arc of Clone Wars.

0,"When I heard we were getting the final season, so many years removed from the original, I was hoping it’d continue the mature arcs that developed in the later seasons.

I was expecting this season to follow suit. The fans of the series have pretty much all grown up at this point- the people that were demanding clone wars return are at the very youngest 12 years old, but the vast majority of us are adults now, myself included.

Unfortunately, Disney doesn’t seem to have realized this, because so far this season has been just as, if not more, childish than rebels. 

The trailers for “the final season” promised dark themes and important arcs fans have been wanting to see for years, like the clone wars during order 66 and the siege of mangalore. What we have gotten instead is nothing close to that. 

The bad batch started well- the first episode bringing Anakin’s romance with padme further into the clone wars was good. But then we got what felt like 3 episodes of filler for an arc that easily could have been concluded in two episodes. Instead of that brief conclusion we deserved, we got 3 episodes that added absolutely nothing to the story and just had ‘action’ scenes that were honestly not that enjoyable to watch.

Then we started the Ahsoka arc. Something I had been looking forward to for months- after all, it was a prominent part of the trailers. Ahsoka was back, and we were going to see what she did in the last months of the clone wars leading into rebels.

But instead of the story we wanted, we have instead gotten an arc with a character that literally behaves as if she is autistic (first confirmed autistic character in Star Wars? Great for diversity, but this wasn’t the time). The first part was bad enough, but this last episode was maddening. The progression in the story could have been completed in a recap.

I understand that this show in general has frequent issues with pacing. And that is fine. However, when I am paying for a service, Disney plus, exclusively to watch this show, I feel completely ripped off.

This is a series I have loved since I was a kid staying home from school sick and watching it. I still remember sitting in my parents room and tuning in for it when new episodes premiered. But I’m older now, and what we have been given feels outright *wrong*. This season, so far to me, has given me the same sense of disappointment that Rebels gave me for the first few seasons before it came into its element. 

I normally wouldn’t care that much, but these are the last 12 episodes we are getting of a show I loved EVER. It feels like a waste, and I’m pissed about it. Especially because I have to pay to get the privilege of tuning in every Friday only to come out of it more disappointed.",The new season of The Clone Wars is awful so far and I’m upset that something I’ve waited years for is ending this way.

0,"So I’ve always wondered why Jedi and with can’t just use their force abilities in every battle. There are so many instances where it would just end a fight in a second. Like, why can’t Vader just choke every enemy, such as Obi Wan in their final battle, instead of actually fighting them. Furthermore, why can’t Jedi just force push every opponent into a wall every fight and break their back on impact? Lastly, with every Kylo Ren fight ever, why can’t he just freeze the enemy and just walk up and stab them. That would have ended the forest fight, throne room fight, and destroyed Death Star fight in seconds.

0,"This is a debate I've been in the middle of a number of times and just want to get a good grasp on where the fandom in general stands to see if maybe its just me that is missing something.

Now the question is does a force user need to be trained to consciously use the force. That means when they are doing something. I'm not talking about the force acting in the background to make someone a better pilot or extra lucky or like a bunch of boxes falling on someone and them catching them in the air. Thats passively using the force.

I'm talking about consciously using it. Like when Obi-wan and Quigon used the force to run down the trade federation ship or when reached out and pulled the saber from the snow or when Cal freezes a bunch of blaster bolts and then pulls a trooper forward so they get hit with their own blaster bolts. Does using the force in that way where the force user knows what they want to happen and makes it happen require training?

Or once a person realizes they have the force should they be able to do all of the above mentioned things as long as they can imagine it?

1) Yes: But only for the most advanced uses of the force

2)Yes: A person needs training to learn how to sense the force around them, clear their mind, envision what they want to happen, and then make it happen

3)Yes: A person needs to be trained in how to make a connection to the force and sense it but after that can do anything with it

4)No: Once a person knows they have the force and can sense the force they can do whatever they want

5)No: As soon as a person knows they are force sensitive they can do whatever they want",Does a force user need to trained to be able to consciously use the force?

0,"Obviously he and Han have been partners forever, and he loved Luke and Leia. Watching over Han and Leia as they started a family was probably a big deal to him, and I'm sure he grew close to Ben during that time. Poor guy had to live through the murder of his best friend by his son, then lost Luke, and of course Leia in RoS. Hearing his cries upon finding out about Leia's passing was absolutely gut-wrenching to me.

0,"I was wondering this with The Last Jedi reveal that her parents were deadbeat alcoholic junk traders that sold her for drinking money. She doesn’t deny what Kylo Ren is saying and even adds saying that they were nobodies. And apparently the novelization mentioned she had repressed her memomeries of what they were like (I haven’t read it). Which is seemingly done to fix the novelization of The Force Awakens which had lines from one of them telling her that they’ll back for her, saying that she made that up.

Then we get to The Rise of Skywalker, and we see they did love her and she was old enough to remember this...yet didn’t argue with what Kylo said about them throwing her away. On a side note, they are awful parents. Instead of abandoning her with say Luke or Leia or anyone in the New Republic or just ask for protection from Palpatine and tell ‘em all about his secret Exagol plot. They just dump her on a Junk Planet with an abusive guardian who uses her for slave labor. Great parenting. Only slightly worse then Han and Leia.

On another side note, I was hoping for something like them being deadbeats because otherwise why would you leave your daughter on a harsh planet with an abusive uncaring guardian. If it was Han, Leia or Luke. That would have ruined their characters. 

But the main point is that Rey really has some memory issues. She might want to get a brain scan or something.",What is up with Rey’s memory?
0,"This is something I’ve been thinking about recently. I know Yoda and Kenobi all saw there way of life destroyed and Kenobi had to fight his brother to the death but R2 has just seen so much. He’s got such a special relationship with Anakin and he watches Anakin fall to the dark side and commit atrocities. He then was with Luke but went shut down when he left for Ahch-To. I mean Luke died and R2 hadn’t seen him in years. And then Leia, the last person he had become close with died only a couple years after he woke back up. There’s also people like Ahsoka who R2 became very familiar with that just disappeared.
And all this time he was still a peppy and faithful droid. 

Ahsoka is a close second in my opinion especially with  her new arc we are seeing.",R2-D2 is the saddest character in all of Star Wars
0,"So Empire Strikes Back is the Star Wars film I most hear mentioned as the best Star Wars movie. I personally agree with this, it's my favorite Star Wars movie and my favorite movie of all-time in general. Now, I've seen a lot of videos and analyses about why A New Hope was so successful, why Return of the Jedi is considered lesser or is actually underrated, or why the prequels were great/bad, the sequels were great/bad, but I haven't seen a whole lot of in-depth discussions about what makes Empire so great.

For me, there's a lot of things at work. For one, it's Vader's best film. It's where he feels like the biggest threat, and it's where he gets the most of his great lines and moments (that scene where he's sitting at the dinner table and blocks Han's blaster with his hand is amazing). 

Secondly, it has the most interesting and diverse settings of the original trilogy. The icy wastes of Hoth, the shadowy swamps of Dagobah, the absolutely gorgeous Cloud City, and even the asteroid belt. 

Third, we get the most information on the Force without it being too much (midichlorians) or too hokey (the Force healing and the Sith/Jedi living in someone thing from the sequels). Yoda and Luke's conversations paint the force as this neutral magical energy that creates, binds, and unifies every single thing in the universe. That the Dark and Light aren't good and evil so much as how one uses the Force and if they respect it and work with it, or warp it and twist it to fit their own ends.

And lastly, it's an extremely well-written tragedy. It's a movie where stuff is bad straight from the get-go (rebels on the run and hiding, Luke gets captured by the Wampa, Han is getting ready to leave) and it just keeps getting worse. Hyperdrives don't work, Luke disappoints Yoda and Obi-Wan, Lando betrays Han and company, C-3PO gets blown to pieces, Luke loses his hand and feels betrayed by Obi-Wan for withholding the truth about Vader. Things literally never stop getting worse until the very end when there's that glimmer of hope as our heroes look out the window of the medical frigate. It's just constant drama and loss and it makes for a very impactful twist coming off of A New Hope being such a (relatively) light-hearted action-adventure romp.

What are your thoughts on Empire? Why is it so loved by so many Star Wars fans? Maybe you don't like it, why not? Let's discuss Empire Strikes Back!",What makes Empire Strikes Back good?
0,"Hey everyone!  
So I’ve always wanted to share my vision that I had of TFA before it came out. 

You know, just seeing these leaked concept arts and leaks about the plot (which by the way, were not 100% real) made me so hyped to see the movie and I kinda had my own vision of it. I changed it a little bit after the movie so it would make more sense.

Now we’re at the end of it and it’s kinda sad, to be honest. I liked the sequels and I’m not that guy who says that Disney ruined SW, because, to me, they didn’t. I’m not saying that I’d have done it better than Disney, that my version of TFA is better than the official one. Of course not! I really liked the movie! (it’s just something that a 14 years old teenager had in mind, so it probably isn’t even good).  
So yeah, there it is:   
\-There has been peace in the galaxy since the Empire was defeated. 

\-Neither First Order nor the Resistance exists at the beginning of the film. 

\-Luke Skywalker has vanished after the events of the Return of the Jedi.   
\-There has been an awakening of the force in some corners of the galaxy again. Many felt it. That’s why the galaxy is afraid. Many started to look for the only hope of the galaxy, Luke   Skywalker.

\-Kylo lives, just like Rey, alone. He lives on Endor.

\-BB-8 has been created by Kylo.

\-Rey finds Luke's lightsaber from ESB in a crashed Star Destroyer on Jakku. 

\-Poe and Finn work together. Their goal is to find Luke. 

\-They try to steal the Millennium Falcon but are caught. That's how they meet Han Solo, who is not going to help them. 

\-Kylo meets Hux. Together they make people join them. The rise of the First Order would have been shown in the movie.

\-Rey meets Finn and Poe. They decide to find Luke together. 

\-They steal the Millennium Falcon and go to Endor, where Luke was last seen.

\-Han and Chewie try to get Falcon back and eventually end up on Endor.

\-Kylo kills Han. 

\-Kylo kidnaps Rey. Finn and Poe rescue her.  
\-Rey takes BB-8 away from Kylo. 

\-Leia tries everything she can to find Luke.

\-Upon hearing of the rise of a new Empire, Leia creates the Resistance.

\-There's a fight between Kylo, Rey and Finn at the end of the movie. Rey wins.   
\-The movie ends just like TFA. Rey finds Luke.

0,"I used to feel as though it was a magical iconic series but across the last 5 years or so it all just seems very average.  Things like padme and anakin on naboo in episode 2 and pod racing in ep1 there something so star wars-like about them but I haven’t really found much of the new content to be able to replicate anything similar.

Could this be that I’ve journeyed into adulthood now or based on the last few years worth of sub par content? Or is it just the modern style feel of the new films?

I’d love to know how others feel.

0,"I think TLJ and TRoS have great ideas and pretty much all of the Jedi stuff is incredible. However, it's weird how some scenes don't really use music and the movies have a lot of unnecessary plot. 

I feel like cutting a few things here and there, then adding a few of the classic tunes would really help the movies pop. Because, overall I think they have fantastic acting and ideas.

0,"I mean,come on, its the dark side. She had no training against it, besides a few months with Luke, and even he didn't really do much to sway her. They're Jedi who train against falling to the dark side since they were like 4 years old and they STILL fell.  Sidious is a master manipulator, trained 3 sith lords (with some on the side!!), it should have been a cake walk to get his own granddaughter to join him. Hell, even YODA embraced the dark side once or twice, even being convinced  to do so by Dooku on one occasion.  Just seems like wasted potential.",Exactly what reason did Rey have to not join the darkside?
0,"**Ahsoka shouldn’t have been created**
First off, I want to start by saying I like her character, I have no large issues with her actual character, it‘s the premise of her character and her *existence* that I have an issue with. I’m also very open to discussion with this

So, firstly, it contradicts Revenge of the Sith in a way, so, as we know, Anakin is denied becoming a master on the Jedi Council, which helps his turn to the Dark Side, and that’s all great, until you realise he was already a master on the technicality *he had a padawan*. She was assigned to him and, as such, he became her master, but if he already had a padawan and was her master, wouldn’t that make him a master during the Clone Wars?

Secondly, her character arc ends with her leaving, which somewhat makes up for the contradiction with Revenge of the Sith and could show that Anakin was unable to become a Master as he couldn’t handle a padawan, but wouldn’t the fact he had one in the first place already show he was a Master.

I feel like the fact Filoni just wanted to take TCW his own way and having to trap himself into corners with his decisions that contradict the movies is the whole issue surrounding Ahsoka.

And finally, this is just an added gripe that sounds like something from saltier than crait, every disney TV show having to have her rather than the show standing on it’s own two feet is annoying, she was great in Rebels and I’m sure she’ll be great in The Mandalorian, but god damn, let the shows have their own stories that don’t involve a major character from another show or movie.",Ahsoka doesn’t make sense in the universe
0,"I have just finished watching Star Wars Rebels and I'm at a complete loss of words. In a way, I feel.. lost?

The entire series was beautifully made and from the start, I loved the characters. From side characters such as Kallus, Maul, and Rex, up to the entirety of the main characters in the Spectre cell. Rebels had every episode matter and link up all together by the end and was, in my opinion, executed perfectly.

The show had such powerful scenes that simply left me stunned, forever being some of my favorite scenes of all time.

The Grand Inquisitor's last words and death bring a feeling of unease and worry about the future.

The discovery of Maul holds fear over what will happen to the main characters.

Kanan's death brings immense sadness and a solemn attitude. 

The Liberation of Lothal and the loss of Ezra and Thrawn into the unknown brings thousands of questions.

What next?

&amp;#x200B;

The end of Rebels was beautiful, being one of my favorite moments of all time in Star Wars history. The epilogue narrated by Sabine was incredible, and seeing all the characters successful was great. The final scene of Ahsoka and Sabine leaving for the journey to find Ezra and Thrawn left me speechless, being so wonderfully executed.

I watched this entire series in under a week because I just couldn't put it down, but now I feel at a loss that the series is over and I no longer have a new episode to look forward too.

0,"Here goes nothing..

EP 1: THE POD RACE - The entire sequence is stunning and edited so well. I love Sebulba's dirty antics throughout the race and it's proof that Anakin is something special.

EP II: CHASE THROUGH CORUSCANT - It's visually stunning. The skyline and many ""levels"" of the city we see gives us the deepest look into Coruscant, my favorite planet from the saga. Also, Anakin's abilities/heroics are on full display as he fearlessly free falls through traffic. 

EP III: PADME'S RUMINATIONS - Two lovers have a ""conversation"", possibly through the force, since they're miles apart. Add in John Williams mesmerizing, emotional score and it's one of the most important scenes in the saga as a teary-eyed Anakin makes a decision that will change the Galaxy forever.

EP IV: BATTLE OF YAVIN - For a movie made in 1977, the trench run is still just as exhilarating as it ever was. Vader showing his flight superiority mowing down rebel pilots and Han saving Luke at the last moment. Simply classic.

EP V: DUEL ON CLOUD CITY - The lighting, the dialogue, Vader's dominance and toying with Luke, all leading to the twist of all twists ""I am your father"". This is what Star Wars is all about - doing something dramatic all the while looking like the coolest thing ever.

EP VI: DUEL ON DEATH STAR II - Watching the Emperor manipulate his loyal apprentice to fight his son in the iconic Throne Room has so many wonderful moments. Luke giving into his hatred, only to fight it off and deny the Emperor is one of the most ""Jedi"" moments. Add in Vader's redemption and there's a reason fans consider this the true ending of the saga - it's just so god damn perfect.

EP VII: DUEL ON STARKILLER BASE - The snowy atmosphere, we get an ex-Stormtrooper using a lightsaber, Rey getting the saber, and Kylo using his wound to fuel him makes for one of the most unique scenes in Star Wars.

EP VIII: BATTLE OF CRAIT - The visual symbolism injected into this scene is next level, the ""red"" beneath the salt representing ""wounds"", Finn wanting to sacrifice, and then Luke showing up to heal old wounds, facing down his nephew in a ""Jedi"" way that mirrors ROTJ in that he refuses to actually fight Kylo be ""Force projecting"".

EP IX: DUEL ON DEATH STAR II RUINS - Where Anakin fought Obi-Wan surrounded by destructive fire on Mustafar, Kylo battles Rey surrounded by healing water on Kef Bir. We see two force users at peak power, using the force to freeze lightsabers, leap super high into the air and we see a confident Kylo wear down Rey until Leia calls his name. Oh and that's not it - Ben gets a vision of his father Han Solo leading to his redemption.

ROUGE ONE: BATTLE ON JEDHA - One of the coolest looking cities in Star Wars, perched atop a mountain with the Temple of the Kyber and the Star Destroyer looming over it. You can feel the tension in the streets before the battle blows up and once it does, you really feel like a rebel amidst an Empire.

SOLO: THE KESSEL RUN - Seeing Han pull off this legendary route is as much fun as you would've imagined it when he spoke of it in the OT. The exotic creatures, the different areas of space and the character interactions make this scene one helluva ride.

I thought that was pretty neat to show the differences.

Ok now we definitely have to talk about Ahsoka and Anakin stuff. She said she went to Skywalker academy, I thought that it was a little funny because for a school name it really fits and isn’t out of place I definitely would believe it, but then it’s also heartwarming to see how much she learned from Anakin in the 3ish years and It was just a really touching moment. Ok now the ship scene oh man that’s a really nice scene the second I heard Yularen I knew where I was going, I could imagine what Ahsoka thinking like I know you and want to talk to you but I can’t! Just damn that would suck, but then she also knew since it was Yularen Anakin and Rex definitely would be nearby so that’s just damn. my question is what were they doing there on coruscant I’m assuming reinforcements since there were a lot of gun ships boarding, and they didn’t have time to land so anakin couldn’t get to see Padmé so it works I think. The moment though when Anakin and Ahsoka sense each other it’s soo nice and I was like yes!! It seamed Like there was a camera thing that the bridge could See trace and Rafa, I’m confused how it didn’t see Ahsoka her arm would definitely be in the shot and when they whipped The camera around she would 100% percent be shown. then there’s the fact Yularen would totally recognize her, and was talking to them personally, I don’t know. Also WHY DOES YULAREN LOOK LIKE THAT WHAT DID THEY DO TO HIM!? I know we see him in the citadel arch for like a second but I don’t remember him looking like that!   


Now the mind trick scene how did trace not hear her?! or question how all of a sudden he changed his mind!? Like unless Ahsoka was speaking soo low that even Trace couldn’t hear her Not sure, The guy next to the leader though was not buying it. curious whats gonna happen and how she reveals She was a Jedi to them and their reaction, if they even notice.

An interesting idea

I have got an idea. What if, in the sequel to fallen order, we could choose what lightsaber form we learn, assuming we use form 1 rn? Then there would be replayability if you cannot change forms during one play through. 

Form 2 Makashi: Lightsaber damage increased, lightsaber attack speed increased. Skill: Temporary increase lightsaber damage and change to strike through block.

Form 3 Soresu: Increase blocking stamina, parrying and deflecting window. Skill: Use no stamina for a time.

Form 4 Ataru: increase precision dodging window, run speed and roll speed and lightsaber damage while jumping. Skill: further increase dodging window and run speed.

Form 5 Shien: Greatly increase blaster deflection window. Skill: passive all blaster bolts are automatically deflected back at sender.

Form 5 Djem So: Increase lightsaber damage, and stamina needed for enemies to block your strikes, overhead strike damage increased. Skill is active, Falling avalanche, instantly drain all enemy stamina and deal damage, knocking enemy down.

Form 6 Niman: Force powers use less force, and precision dodging grants more force, and force powers are more powerful. Skill: For a short period of time, force powers require no force.

Form 7 Juyo:  Attack speed is greatly increased
Skill: Active: use force speed to attack enemy from every direction.

Form 7 Vaapad: damage greatly increased to dark side users, can block Sith lightning. Skill: passive skill: when dark side user use force powerful, it gives you force. The less health the dark side user has, the more force you gain.

Now that I've gotten older I handed down most of my huge collection I had due to being spoiled by my adopted parents to young boys who are new fans. I held onto the ""exclusive"" figures and such but it seems the exclusives are much more common than the figures which were sold in stores. The only figure I have which I've seen have any value or rarity to it is my freeze frame Boba Fett in bubble. What made the exclusives so common and were they even exclusives at all?

0,"Now I’m not praising Rian Johnson for this movie or hyping up TLJ, but I do believe people’s hatred for Luke’s actions here are not considerate. 

In general, this confrontation with Kylo is a result of understanding how the dark side manifests in force users. It feeds off of human emotion and desire, the stronger your hatred means the stronger your desire and the more power from the dark side you can use. Luke already knows the power of the dark side was strong enough to turn the great Anakin Skywalker, The Chosen One, the messiah of the Star Wars universe, into the most powerful Sith Lord to exist. Talk about a scary power. 

Luke also knows the extent of that power as he has felt it before himself. It’s thw power he used to defeat Vader that almost pushed him over the edge. 

Now certainly from these experiences Luke learned that there is still hope to turn away from the Dark Side and come back to the light, but Luke learned about how the jedi order failed Anakin which prompted his temptation to turn to the sith. We all know that while Anakin made the decision, that the Sith were fucking around with him and fueling his bitterness. Luke was scared of teaching these same things to the new generation and rightfully so. 

It did not help that he was now asked to train his nephew, another Skywalker with unworldly potential. But this Skywalker seemed to have it much worse emotionally than his father. While Luke has hope for people, there was a momentary lapse in his judgement that really did make sense. He could’ve easily remembered the destruction of Vaders empitre and understood that the principles he was teaching Kylo were the same principles that made Anakin Vader. In an impulsive fear driven attempt to prevent that, he went to do the unthinkable, but remembered who he was at the last second, accept it was too late.

Now yeah I’m not the biggest fan of who Luke became but that scene did make sense to me in the way it was handled.",Unpopular opinion: Luke attempting to kill Kylo was justifiable given his life experiences.
1,"Just want to say I’m in season 4 and the show has grown on me a lot that I enjoy it. Mostly what I meant by the episodes is more what is necessary viewing and worth watching. From my experience the first 5 episodes of S1, and 2 of course, are necessary. While there’s some in season 1 it’s mostly forgettable and I was really bored during it. S2 had more but again mostly same until I think about episode 15 or 16. I did complain about them cause 14-16 all had O’Brian as s**t out of luck but either 15 or 16 really started it going for me. I think that’s about the time they find the Founders:
S3 I’ve always heard is where the show really picks up and I have to agree as that season and up to where I am now are great. So I agree on that but it does need the last 10+ episodes of S2 to work cohesively. The show grew on me I’ll say that much. 

Now to Odo. I f***ing love this guy. No nonsense but has an amazing sense of humor that I love along with his love/hate/respect relationship with Quark, who should seriously be in prison but that’s beside the point. Right now on episode “Bar Association”, #15 if that’s better, and he straight up calls out a few of the times the Enterprise D got boarded and/or looted. Finally someone acknowledges that the Enterprise got jacked or whatever! 

Seriously the flagship of the Federation got boarded so many times, by non omniscient/omnipotent beings since they are harder to defend against, it kinda bothered me in S6 with the Die Hard in space episode, not saying it wasn’t a great episode it was. I’m just glad someone said something about it out loud: not some admiral reading the reports and going “Jesus Christ. The Enterprise. Boarded again! That’s the fifth time this year and the 10th since Picard took over.” Probably not that much but let’s be fair it’s still a significant number of times. Those security updates every year didn’t help lol. 

Side note even with all this I would love it if the Enterprise E also had a number of the same types of things and the admiral I mentioned just gave up and resigned after the first cause he was just so done with the Enterprises’ ridiculous situations. And he’s a descendant of an admiral that was doing the same in Kirks time so it’s like a family curse for the Enterprise. “No way this new enterprise after 100+ years is going to end up like that one.” Literally a week later “We just got word the Enterprise D came back from an alternate dimension” the admiral flips a table out his window. 
Very long tangent but I hope someone reads that and gets some measure of joy from it cause I enjoyed writing it lol.",Couple of things on DS9: general opinion on what episodes are good and Odo
1,"Tuvix. It's clear a lot of people don't like him. And it seems clear that this is because of two main reasons:

1) The ethical predicament which the crew is forced into as a result of his existence is also forced onto the audience. We don't want to think about it because it makes us uncomfortable. And we hate what makes us uncomfortable.

2) He's not conventionally attractive. Now this is what kind of what bothers me. The whole point (as we all very well know) of Star Trek is to see the bigger picture, to maintain mind over matter and seek justice whenever the opportunity presents itself.

I agree with what Captain Janeway chose in the end, because Tuvok (whose culture teaches him that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few) and Neelix didn't consent to losing their preexisting individuality. If their consciousnesses could have been separated while they were merged, they probably would've advocated to return to that individuality. Of course this is a luxury they didn't have, but I think we can agree that they didn't like it any more than anyone else did.

Cultural mindset is an ever-evolving thing. Right now discrimination against what is socially deemed un-beautiful is just as real as other forms of discrimination. It's just not in the sociocultural or political spotlight right now. We're all hardwired to favor what looks and acts like us: humanoid, laterally symmetrical, emotional. Understandable.

Maybe I'm taking this too seriously but the fact this episode was and is so controversial only highlights an underlying sentiment that doesn't coincide with the values of Star Trek and, by extension, our values as a fandom. In scifi and in real life we're faced at any moment with the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial lifeforms that evolved from a culmination of innumerable variables, we can't possibly imagine what they'd look, sound, or behave like. All I know is if we ever do encounter aliens, they will be so unlike us that we won't know what to feel other than absolute terror, at least initially. We would owe it to them to let go of our anthropocentric and egocentric beliefs and desires. We have empathy; it's our duty to use it.",Hear me out guys pls
1,"It seems a lot of fans feel it's too nihilistic to be considered part of Star Trek, and Picard isn't his usual self? Do you guys feel the same? 

The thing I love the most about TNG is Picard's assertiveness and wisdom, and how he leads the charge despite people around him disagreeing at times. If he's just a passenger, and getting pushed around as some clips seem to suggest on Youtube.. i'll probably give it a pass. I hope this isn't the case.. as the production looks really good in the trailers.

1,"Sometime after the synth ban, Thaddeus contracted "" mendaxic neurosclerosis"" which could easily be cured by curating cells in an ""active positronic matrix."" Unfortunately there was no positronic matrix due to the ban. After all, it's not like the Daystrom Institute had one just sitting in a cupboard...

Oh wait.

Now the obvious answer is that turning on B4 (or Lore for that matter as he is presumably dismantled and in a different cupboard somewhere) would be illegal. But this isn't some random kid, this is the son of Captain William flipping Riker! And we know it's possible to only activate B4's cognitive functions and not his motor ones thanks to Nemesis. Not to mention Data and B4's heads have run disconnected from any bod on several occasions. I think Jurati mentions B4's matrix collapsed like Lal's. But even if that's the case shouldn't Lore be around? And does it really matter if the positronic net is working so long as there's power running through it? These are just cells growing in an friendly environment after all.

I struggle to see Will not making every effort to save his son and Starfleet to refuse his request to turn on a head on a table, no matter how evil that head may be. Starfleet has always seemed to look the other way for it's heros if everything ended alright, even with it's literal Prime Directive, so why wouldn't this have worked?",Wouldn't curing Thaddeus Troi-Riker be easy
1,"Hello there! So bit of background. For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).

1,"Rewatching DS9 season six with a friend who has never seen DS9 before.  First, I love vicariously re-living my first watching through my friend.  It's such a job.

1,"It cost $70,000 per episode of TNG to remaster. This was almost ten years ago. They have made a ton of money with rerun TV deals and much more with streaming. This is cost effective, since HD is more preferable and has an easier sell through. With inflation, and more needed CGI needed let's say each episode of DS9 would now cost $200,000.

That's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).

Even Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.

Then there's CBS all access, who is now paying a lot of money for new Star Trek content with partner deals (Disco, Netflix, and Picard, Amazon). Even they could afford this to entice new subscribers. Something that didn't exist before when it was only a physical disk market and the Blu-rays were sold for far too high a price. 

The lower bar to entry the more money made. They would have made more money with the Blu-rays at a lower price. The lower bar now is definitely streaming. There was complaint that the Blu-rays didn't sell enough, what they didn't say is how well they did with the TV syndication deals, and the HD Netflix, Amazon deals.

1,Back in the 90s I started Voyager a little before Kes left and watched it to the end. I never watched the first few seasons. Yesterday I decided to start Voyager from the beginning and boy am I enjoying this. I loved Janeway before but damn I love her so much more now. I know the ending and how things go their but to finally have the foundation is really enjoyable . I know Voyager gets allot of hate and I don’t disagree with it but I still enjoy it. All the actors are great in Season 1. Tom Paris telling Chakotay to turn into a bird and fly away is laughable in the worst possible way . Neelix is ridiculous as he always has been. The doctor is awesome. I’m so enjoying this.,I’m really enjoying rewatching Voyager
1,"Being slightly provocative, but generally I think it is true.  


The original series was shot in the 60's. Of course it looks antiquated and that Kirk is a bit misogynistic, but when you compare it to other shows at the time it was streets ahead. I'm also amazed at how much of a difference the re-mastered version makes!  


I like TNG, but there is this fable about it that it was all good. For me, I think the first 2 seasons were awfully nd it got better in season 3. It wasn't until season 4 that it gets really good.  


DS9, of the TNG/DS/Voy era is my favourite. The Federation is now not so squeaky clean and perfect like they are in TNG. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the positive outlook for Humanity. In fact, I love it. However, I'm not so naive to think that Humanity will be wonderful in another 300 years. We'll still have our issues, and DS9 is good at showing that.  


Voyager, an attempt together back to the travelling spaceship but have a different look &amp; feel. Just too many annoying characters (Yes I'm looking at you Neelix.. at least Wesley grew out of being annoying!). I'm certainly enjoying it more than I did the first time and it does have some of my favourite characters in it (The Dr, 7 of 9).

Enterprise. I feel so sorry for it. If you look at it really, it was good right out of the door. I reckon if they'd got their full 7 seasons it would now be regarded as one of the best Trek's. I like the premise of Humanity really first getting out there. Sure, I know that T'Pol was brought in to be eye candy for the guys, but she does a brilliant Vulcan! I actually like the whole Crew.

Discovery. How can people not watch it, or only watch 2 seasons and say it is awful? Think of the first 2 seasons of TNG for god's sake! I love Discovery. I think they've done a great job at a difficult time period. I think the guest captains (Lorca, Pike) were also great! I can do the suspension of belief about the Klingons too. Why does everyone give this a hard time, when they ignore the difference in the Klingons between TOS and ST:The Movie? Sure, it's not episodic. So what? That's not how TV is watched now (I""m binge watching Voyager at the moment). I love that you watch the season, see the ends nd then watch it again and get some of the subtleties you missed the first time around.

Picard: TNG 3.0 (TNG 2.0 was the movies). I like it. Again, not episodic. Funnily enough though, Whilst Picard is the glue, I'm enjoying the other characters more. I forget his name, but the Roman Samurai needs to be fleshed out more and I hope we see more of him, but everyone else is great! I really didn't like the Riker to the rescue though. Why would they put a reserve captain in charge of an entire squadron? Stupid! He'd done his cameo, wasn't necessary.  


TAS: I missed that. I've always had problems with it, but I suspect I'll find it interesting now... going off how I'm disliking Voyager less. Also because nuances of TAS have crept into Discovery. I'd love to see this redone in CGI.  


All in all, we are damn lucky we aren't Star Wars fans, although I do watch it, we have great TV to watch. Some of the best ever made and for a 50 years old TV program to stand the test of time is amazing!  


I say don't judge them... just enjoy them for what they are..... bloody brilliant TV (&amp; Some really great movies).",I think it's dumb to compare the various shows
1,"I grew up in a household that loved Star Wars and Star Trek. In fact, my dad probably consistently watched more Trek than Star Wars, but we talked more about Star Wars and were more excited for those movies. He was more of a fan of the movies than the shows too.

I personally like Star Wars more, and I recognize that both fans are super finicky. However, I've noticed that Trekkies are far more intolerant of anything new with Trek than Star Wars fans are with Star Wars.
Maybe since Trek is more niche...?

Despite Last Jedi nonsense, Star Wars fans have been more connected.
I am wondering why both can't just accept anything new and different. The same sucks. You have the original, so love that and try to embrace the new.

I just started watching Voyager last night and it was something I never thought I'd do cause I thought it looked dumb, but I am actually really loving it more so than other Trek stuff.

Yes, I love TOS, TNG, Picard, and the JJ Abrams series. All are fun in their own ways.",Whay are Trekkies more pissy than Star Wars fans?
1,"I've been binge watching Voyager for the first time since it was released, because my memory of it was so bad. Having said that, I've seen some really good episodes. However, season 5 so far is generally quite good.

S5E6 ""Timeless"". The first major breaking of the temporal directive by members of the voyager crew. Really good episodes. Interesting when you see half of sevens cranium. However, the whole episode is excellent. Interesting Captain La Forge.... yet he isn't a Captain in the prequels for Picard (Comics/Books). yes I know it is a different time line.

S5E7 ""Infinite Regress"". Great story. Basically Borg schizophrenia. Some amazing acting from Jerry Ryan. Especially when she changes personalities. The switch is just stunning at times. Also an interesting story line in that she's seeing people whom she has assimilated.

S5E8 ""Nothing Human"". The creature that attaches itself to B'Elanna is absolutely crap. However, the whole story on the morality of using medical research based on, at beast, questionable techniques is superb.

S5E11""Latent Image"". AN interesting ethical dilemma that they resolve in the end, but what I really loved about this episode is it is again an extension of the Dr where he ceases to be less machine and more a sentient life form. He actually talks about the algorithms he has to help him make decisions, and in this case he is given a no-win situation where he has to make a choice, and then how doe she deal with it. My only issue? I just can't see the Captain of the Ship spending 16 hrs in the Holodeck with the Dr. Once more Janeway knows more than everyone else!","Voyager season 5, so far is generally quite good."
1,"I've never fully understood the scene of the Enterprise leaving spacedock in Star Trek II.

Ok, I understand that Spock wants to show Kirk that Saavik is capable of commanding the Enterprise after the Kobayashi Maru failure (not failure). But she's not actually piloting the Enterprise, Sulu is. And therefore there's no reason for Kirk of McCoy to be on edge. Even if Saavik had give the wrong command, Sulu wouldn't have crashed the Enterprise. And the only two commands she gives (that we can hear) are ""aft thrusters Mr Sulu... Ahead one-quarter impulse power"". Not much.

The scene is slightly frustrating because Sulu is not showing piloting skills (he's probably done that hundreds of times) nor Saavik commanding skills.",Out of spacedock sequence in Star Trek II
1,"I really enjoyed Star Trek: Picard and while personally I feel it's a show we can judge ""Pre-Nepenthe"" and ""Post-Nepenthe"" (meaning it was an okay show up till Nepenthe and then it became a great show) the ending has made a lot of people consider if it was really the way things were meant to end. 

I've had this conversation with a lot of friends since the Picard finale and I have agree, it feels like there was a different ending planned and many people think the whole android body thing was a cop out.

Was the original plan right up till the end for Picard to die and not be resurrected but that plan got sidelined when Pat Stewart decided he was having fun and wanted to do season 2?

There's really absolutely no reason to do the android body thing--- what does it get them? It's not like Stewart was playing a significantly older character and with an android body he could now play his own age and jump around. It's not like people would have questioned Picard still adventuring at his age and 24th century medicine keeping him going. 

I've had numerous people say to me this was a cop out and a way to kill Picard but not really kill him so they can do season 2.  Rewatching Nepenthe and Post-Nepenthe I have to agree.

All onscreen deaths count as people who die on screen(pretty self explanatory). So during the chase, Picard’s mentor would count as an onscreen death, or the Yellow shirt who gets killed during Descent would also count. However, ship destruction and causality reports won’t count. So things like the Yamato being destroyed and the destruction of Romulus don’t count.

1,"I’ll admit that the color divisions for Federation officers has always puzzled me. Especially because they change so often. 
And, although Deanna did not wear traditional Starfleet clothing for the better part of her appearance, whenever she does it, she wears blue.

Anyways, as far as I’m concerned (in TNG and subsequent) the color blue is associated with Medical/Science, yellow is Security/Engineering and red is... Well... Red... I think that red regards to command, but I’m not so sure because of Wesley, Geordi and Worf wearing those colors when they belong on Security or Engineering even at lower ranking. I guess in both Geordi and Wesley’s case they wore red because they were often found on ships’s helm. 
In any case... Feel free to explain it to me since I clearly can’t understand on my own. 

Now to Deanna. As ship’s counselor, I would assume her rank is not only more related to commanding the ship as it is a pretty high one at that. I would assume she would wear red as well. Heck, I could even make more of a case for yellow than blue. Why blue? If it’s in regard to her position as almost a psychiatrist to the ship then it makes sense because it would be Medical, but she helps command the ship more then she helps the crew...

I’m ok with out-of-universe explanations like: “Marina Sirtis just liked blue better” as far as I know the whole red and yellow swap in between series happened because of reasons like that. But I wonder if there is an explanation in the lore for her wearing blue...

1,"I just started watching the show. “Enterprise” puts in so much more effort into its alien cultures than other Trek shows. I don’t know if this continues to be the case, but 10 episodes in, I’ve really been enjoying how much world building this show gets done. The alien ship in “Unexpected” for example- the three hours of decompression before going on-board, the food growing on the walls, the different looking aliens with their electricity-like powers. The underground society of Terra Nova, their different way of speaking, the “diggers” that they hunt and how they use their skulls as musical instruments. The design of the Vulcan monastery. There were episodes of Voyager where they didn’t even bother to give the aliens forehead ridges, they just looked and behaved like humans and decorated with IKEA furniture.

It’s not just alien cultures, but the world building regarding human culture that I’ve been impressed with too. They don’t have Federation ideals to live up to because there is no Federation yet.  I like how informal and giddy they are, building snowmen on comets, preparing messages for schools on Earth, pointing out the sun in the night sky. Stuff like this makes it feel real to me. Of course the translator isn’t perfect, they’ve barely met any aliens. Of course they’re all scared to use the transporter, dude just beamed up with twigs in his face!

I haven’t heard many good things about this show, but I’m liking it so far. What are your thoughts on Enterprise?",Something I’ve noticed watching Enterprise for the first time
1,"Another Voyager post, but making a new one as I didn't want it to get lost in the comments of the most recent big Voyager discussion (even though it will probably get lost anyway).

Due to working from home I can watch some evening tv, one of which is Voyager. It's in season 7 and Workforce was just on. I haven't seen this one in years and remember it being pretty stupid. BUT no, actually this two-parter is excellent. There really felt like there was more weight behind what was happening, and the side characters, especially the inspector guy, were well written.  

I especially liked how the whole thing was largely resolved by this character after the main hero of the story, Chakotay, was captured. Janeway's relationship was nice and their goodbye at the end felt genuine.  

It had some problems, but generally was great. Well done, Voyager.",Workforce
1,"I've been re-watching TNG for the first time in about ten years, and I appreciate Dr. Pulaski a lot more now than I ever have before. She's certainly not as warm and comforting as Dr. Crusher, but she's much kinder and more considerate than I remember. There are so many sweet moments of hers that I had forgotten about, but I think my favorite is when she and Worf share the Klingon tea ceremony. I'm glad they brought Dr. Crusher back, but I wish they had made Dr. Pulaski a recurring character in the later seasons.",Reflections on Dr. Pulaski
1,"**Spoilers** of course.


When the saucer crash lands and is destroyed, Picard gets sucked into the energy ribbon. Guinan helps him find Kirk and later they get out, fight Soran and somehow the people who crash landed are saved.

My issue here is that they never show how Kirk and Picard get out of the ribbon, where time has no meaning, and get back to the time before soran plans to launch the rocket. That's a glaring loophole unless I'm missing something.

If I'm not missing anything, then this movie is no better than The Final Frontier.",Question regarding star trek generations movie
1,"Someone on here once summarized Enterprise as ""Bush era Star Trek"" and that nails it for me.

TNG and DS9 might be distinctively 90ies in their own way, but they encapsulate all the charm of low-budget sci-fi first and foremost. I would describe them as ""human"" rather than ""American"" or specifically dated to any decade. Same as the original series being obviously from the 60ies, but more so: timeless.

Enterprise is tainted by all the cold ugliness of early-2000s American television. Especially from a European perspective, it feels so distinctively national all of a sudden that it's really off-putting. it's not in the setting (post-national earth and space) or storyline, it's all evident on a meta-level in the languages of production, setpieces, character writing, themes, set design, costumes.

The whole show feels like it's desperate to be less niche and nerdy and more widely appealing to general American audiences in 2002 and as a result, lost its soul in the process.

I mean... There is a character named ""Trip Tucker"" who looks exactly like his dumb jock name. He likes to punch people.

TL:DR:

Enterprise lacks the warm and familiar, hopeful and fantastical identity of other Trek. If Jack Bauer had a guest spot on an Enterprise episode, he would feel *less out of place there* than a member of the Enterprise crew who  appeared on another Star Trek show in turn.

\--

Three acknowledgements for fairness' sake:

\- Setting a Trek series at that specific time period is actually a really cool idea. The show does get a little better as it goes on. There is some character development, even for f\*\*\* Trip.

\- I was harsh on the era, but there were many good tv shows in the early 2000s (although some of them held up much worse than you'd think)

\- if you like Enterprise, good for you, you are not wrong. It's a preference. I just think that there's like, an 80% likelihood you're also American and like to watch \*The Shield\*.","Reflecting on why I can't bring myself to love ""Enterprise"" like the other shows"
1,"I have been rewatching Voyager after the finale of Picard; and, after she goes full-on eye dilation in the cell, I got the impression that 7 is destined for Borg royalty. 

Here's my evidence. 

Going back to Dark Frontier,  you first see 7 and the queen interact.  What's so surprising about this is that the queen uses personal pronouns.   This is a trait that both she and 7 have in common.

Furthermore,  in the same episode, it's revealed that drones from unimatrix 01 are in close proximity to the queen.  7 of 9 is tertiary adjunct for 01, so we can infer that 7 had previous intersection with the queen prior to Scorpion.  Also, if we understand that higher numbers mean higher rank, as was the case when Harry Kim was demoted from 6 to 2 of 10 in the Omega Directive, then it adds more weight to the evidence that 7 would have routinely been in proximity to the queen. Though it's not clear the consequences of that proximity,  7 would have been an on hand for the queen.


Next, referring back to Dark Frontier, the queen focuses on teaching 7 lessons.  She tries to have her choose to adopt the Borg way, rather than have it foisted upon her.   The goal was to preserve the same individuality that the queen demonstrates,  but have 7 agree that the Borg way is correct.  This duality of making individual choices, but for the benefit of the collective,  may be a key requirement for coronation. 

Also, in the same episode, 7 is able to persuade the queen to let refugees escape assimilation,  7 is immediately tended to after a minor injury (royal treatment for a borg?), the queen compromises on her duties because she doesn't want to push 7 too hard (compromise is irrelevant), reveals that 7 was placed on Voyager to regain individuality, and apologizes that the lessons are difficult for 7.

This is all done under the guise of conquering humanity,  but consider that things can have dual intents.  While assimilating humanity is an obvious goal, this could also be about making 7 get successor.

Lastly, I refer you the Picard episodes involving Ex-Bs.  Their disconnection from the collective leaves the drones' personalities damaged.   But, as the queen says, 7 is the only drone to gain  Individuality.   This difference may be what would eventually empower 7 to exert will like the queen if/when crowned.  In Broken Pieces,  7 exerts this exact will in the cell after being wired in a similar fashion as the queen.  She fits the queen pattern.",My fan theiry: 7 of 9 was/is next in like to succeed the Borg Queen
1,"On Voyager right now, and there aren't many ""Central"" episodes focused on Janeway. This happened in TNG as well with Picard not getting many episodes of his own. Now I'm not saying that the captains aren't the main protagonists of their shows, because they are. I'm just surprised that the writers didn't give them more episodes that have a large focus on them since TOS had many episodes with Kirk as the driving lead of certain stories. Why do you think this was the case? I'm not sure about ENT, DS9 or DIS since I haven't watched them yet but I'm guessing it's a similar case.",Why do you think there aren't many episodes that focus on the captains?

1,"So I'm just starting Voyager for the first time. After watching the first episode last week, I was so excited I just searched this sub for stuff regarding the series (trying to avoid spoilers).

But I was pretty sad because a lot of it was just talking about how the series has a lot of 'missed opportunities', etc... I remember one critique was regarding how quickly the whole crew got along instead of having lingering harsh feelings.

Maybe it's just because of quarantine and covid, but I *love* that they set aside their differences for the shared goal of **simply going home.** They knew they had to be there for each other. They knew they had to put their best talents to work in order to advance their mission and hopefully find an ingenious way of getting back to Earth.

It's such a heartwarming series to have right now, and damn do I wish we could all just set aside our differences and do what's best to...well... eventually get us out of our homes and be safe and healthy once again.

1,"Personally I felt it dragged on way to long. During season seven we would be doing something with the war like the resistance or Starfleet, but then we would go back to Dukat and Winn and I’d just sigh. It felt like they were just putting enough in there to develop the story and to remind you that the plot existed but they needed to drag it for an entire season, so there wouldn’t be enough to actually answer anything. Then there was the finale. The dominion war ended very well, we had our big fight(that refused footage sadly), the founder gave up, we had tension with the Cardasians and then their switch midway through(which was lucky for Starfleet, since I noticed they were using the same tactics Robert E Lee used at Gettysburg and you know how that turned out.), you then went to the treaty and everything was fine, but then you had Dukat. He goes and summons the Pah wraiths. My problem is that I’ve never liked, “wipe out everything” threats, and that is exactly what the Pah-wraiths are. The only times I see them fitting is over the top superhero films, and DS9 isn’t one. Then Sisko destroys them by throwing him, Dukat and the book over into the fire, and now he is with the profits(I think?) I think it’s just me but it feels like an unsatisfying end to his character. I know the Prophets said that he could never live on Bajor, but really? You couldn’t have him move back to Earth, or just say fuck the Prophets and live on Bajor. I know it’s probably just me, but I don’t like it.",(Spoilers) What do you guys think of the Pah-wraith subplot in DS9
1,"The Silent Star (""Der Schweigende Stern"") is a 1960 East German/Polish science fiction film based on ""The Astronauts"" by  Stanisław Lem. While it is set (probably) in the 1970s as opposed to the 2260s, it has a very Star Trek Original Series vibe. It is about a multi-national group of scientists who have put aside earth-bound concerns (race, religion, politics, nationality) to get into a spaceship and go on an adventure together for the good of all humanity. 

But what is interesting is that you are seeing this familiar story told through a Soviet Bloc lens. In TOS, everyone works together but implicitly everyone is basically American - the ship is even the ""USS Enterprise"". In The Silent Star, it is implicit that the Soviets have the upper hand.

An example of what I mean: Toward the beginning, some reporters are interviewing the mission leader, a soviet professor. 
Reporter: ""Why not just a team of Soviet scientists? It's their rocket!"" 
Cosmonaut: ""Landing on Venus cannot only belong to one nation. We are not just internationalist in our politics. In a peaceful world we don't keep our successes to ourselves.""

The rocket is Soviet-built and they are letting an American tag along from a sense of good-will. The Soviets were also the first to land on the moon, and have an international research base there. It's the same happy, cooperative future, but with the Soviets on top! 

It's no surprise that a show made by and for Americans would be pro-American, and one by and for members of the Soviet Bloc would be pro-Soviet. I think it's an interesting jumping-off point for thinking about the implicit assumptions of Star Trek, though. A ""Star Trek"" made by Vulcans might look very different again. 

One last note, I don't want to push this film too hard: The plot is well-trodden ground by this point, and the details are a bit hard to follow in places. The gender politics are _very_ TOS as well, unfortunately. But I think in general, TOS fans may get a kick out of it.","Star Trek through a cold war lens: ""The Silent Star"" (1960)"
1,"I just recently finished watching the entire DS9 series for the first time. As a longtime fan of Voyager, TNG, and TOS, I never got around to watching DS9 until now. I simply wanted to praise the show - it was a really enjoyable experience to watch. Specifically:

* I felt like overall, the writing was consistently good throughout the series. Like other longstanding series of Trek I felt like the show definitely picked up and got better as it progressed. 
* I enjoyed the portrayal of Sisko and his son Jake as a normal single father and son relationship. They just genuinely loved each other and there wasn't ever any weird or forced tension between the two of them. It was simple, and it worked.
* I absolutely adored Odo and his whole backstory. I would have loved to have seen more done with him as a character, and I wish he would have been given more opportunities to use his unique shapeshifting abilities. Rene Auberjonois did an outstanding job in that role.
* I enjoyed the interesting storytelling that came out of the Dax character. I thought they handled the transition to Ezri Dax surprisingly well considering she was in it just for the one season.
* I loved Garek as a side character. Initially I thought he was really weird but I appreciated the development and attention he was given. I thought the actor who played him did a really good job. I wish there would have been more of him!
* I absolutely hated Vedek/Kai Winn but I think that is a testament to the actress's portrayal of her character and her writing. Both were well done.
* I did think Dukat was resurrected as a character too much. Once would have been fine but he ""came back"" too much after I was given the impression he was gone for good.
* I felt like the very last episode tied things up better than I expected it to. Compared to the very last episode of Voyager I found it to be a lot more believable and realistic.
* Standout episodes (sorry don't remember the specific names or #):
   * The one where the team recruits Garek to sneak into Cardassia
   * The one where they travel back in time to the TOS era (brilliant writing and editing in this one)
   * The one where Jake loses his dad in a freak accident and his entire life plays out trying to get his dad back (very good writing in this one - I cried!!)
   * The one where they form a baseball team - loved when Odo, with great satisfaction, booted people from the game.
* Can an HD remaster of DS9 and Voyager happen please?!?!

1,"I've been reading a lot lately about the constant advancements in virtual reality tech. Just last year London's Saatchi Gallery immersed visitors in a twenty-minute, interactive (mostly) ""virtual reality experience"" that they could see, hear, smell, and feel on their skin. Haptic tech is making it possible to experience the sensation of touching virtual objects or standing in a virtual wind. Right now VR developers are busy incorporating eye tracking tech into VR headsets, making better-quality graphics possible, because the virtual environment only has to be in full resolution where the user is looking. Artificial intelligence may soon enable non-player characters to engage in natural conversations. VR is constantly getting better at imitating reality. Eventually, it may seem very real.

Reading about all of the constant progress in VR led me to imagine a future in which you could experience almost anything you've seen in an episode of Star Trek, as if you were inside the Star Trek universe, almost like a holodeck with programs based on Star Trek episodes. Think of it. What if you could experience what it would be like to  stand on the bridge of the Enterprise, whichever registry number you prefer, as it goes into warp, pilot the Defiant through the Bajoran wormhole, challenge Kira Nerys to a game of springball, or visit the city of ShiKahr on the planet Vulcan with Spock as your guide? Personally, I'd be thrilled just to be able to walk the promenade of Deep Space Nine and see my favorite characters there or explore the interior of the Enterprise D. It might also be fun to play tongo with Jadzia Dax at Quark's (if someone would create rules for the game based on what we see and hear in DS9).

No Chakotay means another love interest. I vote for Geordi. Finally, we have Worf who didn't see a threat he didn't want to set phasers on kill.

I really adored the three-way interaction between Seska, Culluh, and Janeway. Culluh is a deeply egotistical man who comes from a deeply misogynistic culture. Yet here, he is caught in between two extremely assertive, intelligent, and cunning women. As the negotiations slip out of his control, his own impotent misogynist rage drives him to attempt to reassert his authority, but Janeway just shuts him down and later so does Seska too.

Given Seska's skills and her domineering personality, it's very likely that had their takeover of Voyager in ""Basics"" succeeded, the Nistrim would have conquered all the other Kazon sects and began presiding over a united Kazon species. Culluh would be the de jure leader, but all power would effectively belong to Seska.

One minor detail that I found interesting - Tuvok was one of the conservative Starfleet officers who opposed Spock's proposed peace with the Klingons in 2293. As he will later share, at that time, he was serving on the Excelsior under Sulu, and he harbored an intense dislike for humans. When Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant, Tuvok was already over a 100 years old. His evolution really is interesting. 

This was a really great episode, and to top it off, it ends with a really inspiring speech from Janeway:

&gt;In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where  shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to  rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Federation.

1,"We are about a month away from the twenty-sixth anniversary of *All Good Things*, which first aired twenty-five years after *Turnabout Intruder -* 5/23/94 and 6/3/69 respectively. I know when I was a kid in the nineties (between about five and nine years old), TOS looked pretty hokey at times; I could easily tell it was an old show, from the womens' haircuts, the uniforms, the colors, the blockiness of the consoles and dated special effects and so on. TNG was, by comparison, super slick and brand new, all subdued tones and elegant curved surfaces. I enjoyed them both anyway - I always preferred the movies with the original cast, they just seemed much more human and, ironically, grounded in reality compared to the TNG films. 

Anyway, I assume people still introduce their kids to prior Star Trek, so I was wondering if kids these days see TNG as being just as hokey and outdated to them as the TOS did in our day. I've been perusing some of the remastered TNG episodes and they look gorgeous, but they also reveal some of the limits of the matte sets and costume makeup, which might look pretty corny to someone who didn't grow up with the lower-res originals.",Twenty and thirty-something parents of /r/startrek - does TNG look as dated to your kids as TOS looked to you at their age?
1,"To give a little context - about three years ago I decided I wanted to watch Star Trek. I'd grown up with TNG on the television but aside from seeing it on whenever someone else was watching it, I didn't know very much about the over arching story. I spent the next 20 months watching every iteration of Star Trek that was out there. I used to have the dates all saved as to when I started and finished each but it essentially went:

- TOS

- Star Trek Continues (I know its not canon but it was good)

- TNG

- DS9 (my personal favorite)

- VOY

- ENT

- DIS

In between Star Trek Continues and TNG I watched all six movies with the original series cast. After TNG I watched First Contact and Insurrection but somehow missed Nemesis. 

Late Friday I started the first season of Picard. By saturday I'd finished it and frankly I didn't think it was very good but I stuck it out. After it was over I really missed the Picard I grew to know over 7 seasons of TNG. I ended up sitting down and watching a marathon of First Contact, Insurrection and finally Nemesis. 

None of these were exactly fantastic movies by any stretch but they were, in my opinion, far more true to Picard's character than the actual Picard show was. Poor writing and plot aside, Picard's character in 'Picard' just seemed too different. The whole tone of the show was far more Discovery than it was TNG and frankly I think that was part of the problem. I don't dislike DIS (anymore - that first season was hard) but I had high hopes that Picard would be a return to the Trek of old...instead it was more of the same watered down new age Trek that we've seen since the JJ Abbrams movies and Discovery. 

I just miss the hopeful optimism of TNG and Captain Picard. I miss the vaulted speeches where he defends humanity's advancements to John De Lancie (as an example). Picard as a show really missed the point of Picard's character in my opinion and honestly I hope it gets better from here because I feel like it can't get much worse than a crappy French accent and an eye patch.","I ran a marathon yesterday with First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis and it made me really sad about Picard"

I loved the idea that humanity had progressed to the point where the challenge was to improve one's self. I miss the idealism of the earlier Star Trek, where we get to know the characters intimately and understand their challenges rather than big faceless entities with their corruption and failings etc.

1,"There are a hundred new tv series premiering each season, many of which are garbage. The point is there seems to be plenty of money to throw away at all kinds of ideas.

Its no secret many Trek fan simply want another show with the values and themes that seem to have been actively ignored/removed - exploration, deep characters, a story without constant betrayal and destruction as themes. None of the forced melodrama, conflict and catering to every modern trope thats the hallmark of JJ era Trek. A story about betterment of humanity.

Of course some people will say its cool, its the same old, that Trek needs to be reinvented. I disagree and so will many. In any case we've now had plenty of new series and movies of nuTrek. Can we not get one in the spirit of old Trek and just see how it fares?",Why can't there be a show for those who want the 'old' Trek?
1,I'm rewatching DS9 again right now and I heard nods like Sisko mentioning that ships have been lost in the badlands and I'm now in the beginning of season 3 episode 19: Through the Looking Glass where Tuvok makes a cameo appearance 😊 He's always been one of my favorite Voyager characters. It's super hard binging the first few seasons of Voyager by itself so *I was wondering if anyone had a chronological order list of when Deep Space Nine on Voyager came out on TV. It may be interesting to binge both of them at the same time going back and forth like if it was just coming out on TV 📺 :)*,Does anyone have a guide on when DS9 and Voyager came out on TV in chronological order?

Is it possible that the Klingons in Discovery and the alternative timeline are supposed to be what Klingons looks like before their genetic mishap and what they look like after is what we see in TNG or DS9, Voyager? Anyway just a few thoughts.",Question about Worf
1,"I've listened to the Star Trek: The Next Conversation Podcast (hosted by Matt Mira (a huge Star Trek nerd) and Andrew Secunda (a newbie to Trek, other than TOS)).

Based on what they've said about the show, I've no interest in watching Picard. However, my ridiculous headcanon to explain the whole situation that caused the Zhat Vash is that a video game historian/nerd from somewhere in the 30th (or whatever) century went back in time to get the original Mass Effect trilogy for a museum, their personal collection, or something, experienced some catastrophe that sends their ship back in time to Aia and mostly damages the ship such that it's only able to beam bits and pieces of of the games into someone's head as a jumble, mixing the geth and the reapers with information about a &gt;!cyborg tentacled species!&lt; that should be avoided. All of this is misinterpreted by the Romulans since the tech is badly damaged enough to injure the brain of some of those who experience it and make them insane.

1,"Just a background, i watched voyager when i was a younger.  It was a re-run being shown daily on a cable channel late at night.  I don’t think they showed all the seasons though. I don’t remember much except the ending. And the fact that at that time capt janeway was one of the first female leads i saw on tv (im 35f). This is also the only star trek series i watched besides the new ones like discovery and picard.
Am currently on s2e7. A few observations on my rewatch:
1. Still fave bellana and harry (so far)
2. I find it a welcome change that storylines are not focused on one or couple of persons only like discovery and picard.  Seeing other officers perspective is nice.
3. Am i supposed to find tom paris sexy??
4. I change my mind on chakotay, kes and neelix per episode haha
5. Fave episode so far is s2e1. I love the question that show posed regarding staying or proceeding with their journey
6. I am starting to get tired of the holodeck lol
Anyway, any episodes i need to look out for? In the other series, does the holodeck play a big part (really getting tired of the holodeck haha)?",Re-watching voyager during lockdown
1,"Fans often talk at length about their favourite captain, but I want to discuss what you think about all of them. What do you like and dislike about them all? 

Here’s mine if anyone is interested. 

Pike
Best: He’s the most human, flawed yet heroic, and the epitome of StarFleet. When I think of a captain I’d like to serve with, it’s him. He’s my favourite.

Worst: Not enough of him.


Kirk
Best: The fact that he often decides what’s moral, rather then going with what’s expected of him. Unlike other captains, he knows that The Federation isn’t perfect and so he bends the letter of the law to do what he thinks is right. He is also a tactical genius, and charismatic as hell.

Worst: Due to sixties writing he can come off as a little emotionless, and sometimes too stern.

Picard
Best: Morally one of the finest officers in the fleet. Probably the most moral captain of all time. 

Worst: He is so goddamn stuffy and up himself. Especially early on. I get people love him a lot and I think he’s a great character, but if I knew him in real life, he’d be the worst boss.

Sisko
Best: I love his backstory and how he is a family man at heart. I love his relationship with the Bajorans, and think he’s a tactical genius. 

Worst: Too militaristic for me. Took too long to find his character. 

Janeway
Best: When written well, she is the paragon of virtue. Kind yet brave, commanding respect without being cruel. Moral without being naive. Also the smartest of all the captains we’ve seen. 

Worst: Unfortunately she was written inconsistently. Sometimes she’d be willing to bend the rules, other times she’d stick to her guns no matter what. Sometimes she was a warm kind person, other times she was cold and stern. 

Archer
Best: I love the flawed perspective of his character. Making him the person to inspire The Federation, he could have been too perfect, instead he was written as flawed and complicated. Sadly his arc was cut short, and we never got to see him at his best. He was also a keen strategist and a willing explorer.

Worst: Like Janeway, he was written inconsistently, although in my opinion less so. He sometimes became cold for no real reason, and other times he seemingly gave up his ethics all together. 


Georgiou and Lorca
I’m including these two together, because to me they’ve both got the exact same flaws and qualities, but for completely opposite reasons.

Best: I immediately want a show for both these characters. They are portrayed by fantastic actors and had a lot of stories to tell. If they were allowed to run their course, they may be in my top rung of captains. 

Worst: They weren’t allowed to run their course. For one reason or another they were both written out of their stories at the earliest possible place and weren’t allowed to evolve. In the case of Lorca, the biggest shame was the end twist. Before that we were given a complex and morally grey man. Sadly that didn’t last, and he was quickly turned into a moustache twirling villain. I didn’t mind the idea, in fact it was very well done, but the final execution wasn’t good enough. Sad.",What Are You’re Thoughts On All The Captains?
1,"At least twice the Borg tried to assimilate Earth with only 1 cube (second time with a sphere in it as well) and failed. 

The Borg Queen told 7 of 9 they they wouldn't succeed a 3rd time which is why they wanted to develop another method of assimilation by assimilating them by throwing a nanoprobe virus into the atmosphere which is a method they were developing for ""highly resistant species""

Why not just sent multiple Cubes if they want Earth so badly? They obviously wanted Earth badly enough to go thru the trouble of capturing 7 of 9 to help them in the assimilation so it seems to me like it would be worthy of them to spare a few Cubes for a while away from another task. Seems efficient enough to me and worth it from their perspective

We also know the Borg after failing for years to assimilate species 116 according to Arturis eventually they just sent hundreds of cubes",Why The Borg Send Only 1 Cube To Earth If They Wanted To Assimilate It So Badly?
1,"So here's a thought experiment, because why not.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would happen if different Star Trek captains, main ones from the shows or maybe others if they are fleshed out enough, found themselves faced with the Deep Space Nine assignment?

I've been pondering this specifically with reference to Deep Space Nine, because in that series the chain of events that unfolds kind of isn't focused on Sisko, he is at the forefront of events and he definitely shapes them, but a lot of what goes on is bigger than him. Theoretically any captain could take that assignment, of course he's the emissary as well, but hypothetically we could assume another captain was a child of the prophets instead.

So what, in you good folks opinion, would happen if for whatever reason Picard had caught the DS9 assignment, or Janeway? Or maybe Riker gets his first command on the station, or some sort of time-skipped Kirk, Archer or Lorca?

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thoughts are:

Picard probably messes it up and the Dominion wins. I could see him handling the Cardassians more effectively, because he's got longstanding beefs there, but I think the Vorta would be able to play him long enough to get a foot in the door and take the Alpha Quadrant. If he got tested the same way that Sisko did to work out his intentions in that simulator the Dominion might be all like, ""Solids are back on the menu boys!"" and just go straight in.

Janeway is plenty ruthless enough to get things done and I suspect that her closer relationship with Starfleet (remember Sisko is about to quit when he takes the job) probably means less guff from Bajoran separatists, more redshirts on the ground of Bajor and more ships at the wormhole on the regular. So I could see things all going pretty stale in that regard, a perpetual standoff.

Kirk flirts with the female changeling and the war is called off.

Lorca lets the Pah-wraiths out and everything goes directly sideways.",How Would Other Captains Have Handled The DS9 Story?
1,"While I enjoyed the episode overall (although I don't get why it was so necessary to study the quasar immediately instead of coming back here after delivering the medicine... but whatever) I have to say the ending is really strange.

You know what I'm talking about, the way they all try to make Spock realize he actually acted on emotion instead of pure cold logic for once. They're all having a hoot, laughing and in a really good jolly mood. Immediately after they just lost two crew members who were brutally murdered. Really?   
I feel like the writers must have forgotten about this when writing this ending, that's just nuts.",[TOS] Galileo Seven - small thought on ending
1,"A thing I have turning over in my mind a lot is why I don't like new Trek and I think I finally know why. Some Picard season 1 spoilers below. 

The last two seasons of new Star Trek, but also just a lot of science fiction in general, do these ultimate ""all life everywhere at risk"" storylines and it takes all the weight out of a story.

I was listening to the The Greatest Discovery podcast and they were talking about all the ways the themes of Picard season 1 were unfolding and upon re-watching, yeah, I could see all that, but it didn't make me feel anything.

I feel like introducing some kind of universe ending super bad guy robs the story of any weight it could have had. We know they're probably not ending Picard on a note of all organic life is getting destroyed, so the stakes don't feel real. All the best episodes of Star Trek are ones with personal or political stakes, where the outcome is genuinely uncertain. Obviously the format dictates a return to some form of status quo, that's television. But I feel like this kind of ultra high stakes scenario is so cartoonish, _especially_ when it's the kind you can solve by hitting the right button at the last second.

There's a lot of criticism of gritty Trek and that it should be more optimistic and I don't agree with that. Some of the best Trek is about taking a hard look at moral ambiguity, such as the Maquis plotlines in DS9. What I think is missing from modern Trek is the mundane. You could have the same story of Picard season 1 but, in my opinion, many times more effective if everything just happened at a smaller scale. You don't need to invent an extra secret Romulan police, you don't need an AI that will end all organic life, this can be a story about Picard trying to do right by the people he's wronged and about how he misses Data and is forced to contemplate death and age and his own blind idealism. Those are all great themes that the show is tackling. I don't think it needs big AI space worms being summoned through a portal.

This got a little rambly. Anyway. Curious to hear what you all think.",I'm tired of high stakes science fiction.
1,"An interesting experience! I watched the season in the space of about a week, so everything was fresh going through. 

It would have been nice if the mycelial realm wasn't a multiverse-ending disaster waiting to happen, as an infinite number of universes will result in one ignoring the warning signs and killing everything. However, I can see it being a multiverse-spanning network essential to their travel to the mirror universe. I enjoyed the references to interphasic space, Defiant, and transporter travel in an ion storm. 

The overshoot on return could have been bigger. I found it disappointing that the Federation could be broken so thoroughly in less than a year. 

Some of Burnham's voiceovers were good, others a little cheesy. Still, an actor can only do so much with their lines and direction. 

Now, I did find mirror Georgiou disappointing. She just hands over the detonator and walks away. Who was Admiral Cornwell's speech for anyway? The bridge crew had to know the real captain was dead and all of them knew of the mirror universe. 

Starfleet resorting to genocide to win the war is...it's not ideal. I would expect more from the Federation. I think if we were in the war longer, seeing the endless grind and loss of system after system, it would have been easier to accept their resorting to genocide. Popping in at the end leaves us too fresh to accept the desperation. 

I don't think L'Rell will have a long-term hold on the Klingon Empire if her only tool is to kill everyone. I'm also deeply surprised that a small Klingon task force in eyesight of Earth (undefended, no Starfleet ships in sight) would turn back when they could claim the honor of desecrating the enemy homeworks. 

Having watched the clip on YouTube back when it first aired, I got very excited when we reached The Scene. Seeing Enterprise and hearing the theme put a massive smile on my face and a thrill in my heart. 

I'm looking forward to season 2 and seeing a proper Klingon D7.",Finished DSC season 1

So now that season 1 is over I'm thinking hard about season 2. And I very much enjoyed the show. Yes, yes, there were the occasional plot holes and a couple uses of the idiot ball, but overall I enjoyed the story. But there were times when they only scratched the surface of some of the ramifications of things, and I really wished they had delved deeper into them.

In Picard, the ships (few as they are) that we see have sort of the same look and I miss the days when Starfleet ships were painted and not just metallic. I’m guessing the reasoning will be something along the lines of, ships don’t rust in space or whatever. Or maybe not. Maybe it’s a new, fancy metallic paint made for high warp efficiency.

1,"So I'm mid season 2 of Voyager and loving it. Seriously, this is what I love Star Trek for - discovering new life forms, being put in morally questionable situations. The villains are just the villains, they usually have a valid reason to be--if there is a villan in the first place. This is my kind of sci-fi.

However, despite I love the show ideas and the casting, the characters are underdeveloped and underused. It's season 2 and I still don't know much more about Paris or Torres than I knew from the pilot. The best developed character is the Doctor, which is good since he's just super fun to watch. TOS had Spock, TNG had Data, DS9 had Odo, and here it's the doctor. It's funny the least human character is always the best.

But, I really don't like the fact they underuse Tuvok so much. I mean, he didn't even lead a SINGLE episode. There were episodes about the Doctor or Kes, but not Tuvok! And he has so much potential, the actor is just great, I love his portrayal of the character. I want more Tuvok!

1,"I grew up watching TNG, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.   I also reluctantly tried B5 (not ST obviously) and enjoyed it immensely.   Picard has been the only series to keep my interest since the end ov Voyager.  I enjoyed seeing all the flaws in humanity and I really enjoyed seeing Picard finally actually see some very realistic push back to his plans.

I was fine with all the themes and I am very much looking forward to the next season, so please everyone cut this crap about the writing being awful because that's just a you-thing.

1,"I know that the writers have already admitted the only reason they created the Queen was because the drones were impersonal and they wanted a tangible antagonist for the audience. 

However, it is completely antithetical to the essence of the Borg that they have a Queen. Therefore, in-universe, it is only possible to make sense of her existence by interpreting her as an aberration. And, when viewed through this lens, it actually makes more sense out of every other appearance of the Borg since First Contact. 

For instance, in this light, the existence of Unimatrix Zero then becomes an autoimmune response to the presence of a free radical in the collective in much the same way that Hugh triggered the events of *Descent.* We see similar phenomena in the episode *Drone*, with the children of the episode *Collective*, and with the events relayed in *Survival Instinct*. And, of course, Patient Zero is Locutus. 

In each incident of errant drones, they are regarded as either anomalies to be re-assimilated or diseases to be purged. Therefore, I conclude that the Queen is simply another unincorporated anomaly that spread out of control and became, in essence, a collective within the Collective. She is not actually ""The Queen"" of The Borg at all; She is a malfunctioning drone.",[Fan Theory Query] The Borg Queen Is A Cancer In The Collective

1,"For example a show set in the Romulan or Klingon empire's in which the Federation were portrayed as a a rival or antagonist faction from the perspective of the main cast. Or a show set on Bajor during the occupation following a resistance cell.

I guess from a TV production perspective the biggest sticking points would be the makeup budget of having a whole main cast of alien characters. Also the perceived challenge of selling a sci-fi show in which humanity is not the focus. But it would be great to see how different cultures in Trek have dealt with similar challenges to what we have seen Star Fleet crews tackle, like how the Romulans handled their first encounters with the Borg or Q messing with a ship full of increasingly enraged Klingons.",Would a Trek show set outside the Federation work?

Red alert: I am only a few days old on Reddit and I’ve only been watching Star Trek for the past year or so, but I have fallen completely in love. I discovered it (TNG/OS) during a time I was very depressed and off work and it filled my heart with questions and inspirations and love and made my life better. Talking about it makes me very, very happy.

1,"I have no idea if this has been mentioned recently or at all but can anyone tell me how in the hell the transporters are still in use? Between accidentally sending Kirk into the mirror universe, creating two Rikers, sending Sisko back into 2024, and other such mistakes that I don’t remember throughout TNG and at least one or two others in DS9, up until “Past Tense”, it seems like even though they’re rare mistakes the seriousness of them should be something that Starfleet at least looks into. 

Is there any canon material that says Starfleet finds these occurrences within acceptable parameters? Like they’re 100% safe or 99% with some “minor” problems? Is there a transporter manual that gives all the potential dangers of transporting? Can’t transport in an ion storm, there just happens to be a singularity going on somewhere in the system, or other such situations that would be hard to control. 

I feel like Pulaski was well within her rights to distrust transporters. Probably reads all the reports and goes to her supervisor or subordinate and tells them “eh. Told you so. Look at this, sent 200yrs into the past. Never using another one, even after that incident with the genetically altered kids and getting old.”

Total side note the Dax symbiont caught on really quick to the situation and adapted within seconds of waking up. That’s impressive as hell and makes total sense for the character as the symbiont has 8 life times of experience.

1,"In VOY: Year of Hell, Part 1, Tom Paris likens the construction of transverse bulkheads throughout Voyager's hull to the watertight bulkheads on the ancient Earth steamship RMS Titanic.

According to Memory Alpha, Year of Hell was filmed in August of 1997, with the scripts presumably being put together just prior. The episode first aired in November 1997.

According to Wikipedia, James Cameron's Titanic began production in 1996, aiming for a July 1997 release date, before eventually slipping to an actual premier in December 1997.

Voyager originally aired on the United Paramount Network (UPN), and Titanic was in part produced and released by Paramount Pictures.

So, two questions:

1. For anyone who watched Year of Hell's initial broadcast: how aware of the Titanic was the general public at this time? As far as I can tell, contemporary common knowledge would mostly have stemmed from the 1958 movie A Night to Remember, and possibly news coverage of Ballard's discovery of the wreckage in 1985. Was this reference to the structural composition of that ship well understood? As someone born in 1993 who didn't start watching Star Trek until 2007, I could so vividly imagine those dramatic watertight door scenes from the film, but I wonder if the same was true prior.

2. Is there any evidence that this was a sly advertisement by Paramount for their major upcoming James Cameron helmed motion picture? Presumably the buzz around the movie would've been out by the beginning of 1997, maybe even a Superbowl commercial, if they we're aiming for a summer release. By the time filming of Year of Hell began in August, the Titanic producers would have committed to the December release, and what better way to entice people to come see your expensive blockbuster than to drop hints into your network shows!

Not trying to start any conspiracies or hate on anything, Titanic is maybe my favorite movie ever. Just some interesting coincidences I notices while poking around with dates. Thoughts?",Titanic and Star Trek
1,"V has never been my favorite, nor most people's. But I recently rewatched it with my daughter and I realized that there were a lot of moments that had stuck with me. 

For all the life and death they went through in the other films, some of the most personal moments where in V. It's the only time, that I can recall, that we see the crew on actual out of uniform shore leave. We get to see how they interact with each other when their not on duty or doing anything particularly interesting. 

We learn not only about their families and their losses but how much these experiences effected them personally. When Sybock reveals Spock's pain to him,  Spock's emotional silence is DEVASTATING. All his logic and discipline mean nothing in that moment, and that's what arguing with your brother is like. We learn that they never got over these traumas and probably never will, they just learned to live around them, and they never shared these things with their closest friends. Like real people. 

To this day, when I'm upset about something and someone tries to dismiss it with a platitude, I still remember Kirk saying, ""I don't want my pain taken away from me. I NEED my pain!"" To him, he's not a hero, he's someone who thinks very deeply about pain and loss and death and that's what drives him. He can be cocky and brash on the surface, but underneath he's very aware of the risks he takes. The other movies told us a great deal about WHO Kirk is, I thought V did the best to explain WHY Kirk is.

Now, there's a lot of silliness and schlock, too, so it's still not my favorite. But it got me wondering what might have been. There was a good movie in there somewhere, it just never got finished.",I wish Star Trek V had been more realized.

1,"Jake Sisko should have done an investigative report on his fathers actions with the Maquis specifically with regards to the bio bombing of the Maquis colony making it inhabitable to human life and forcing the people living there to mass evacuate with nothing but the clothes on their back. This should have led Jake down a road of further investigating some of his fathers decisions and turning over some very uncomfortable stones. Real Star Trek is a show that displays what intellectual, wise, self actualized adults and societies do to resolve problems in the most humanist/ethical way they can. The themes of the Federation have never been about them or humanity not having problems but how their approach to resolving problems differs from what has been done before without a humanist ideology. Showing how the Federation deals with freedom of the press and a citizens access/right to information was a big missed opportunity.

Next, Captain Sisko should have died with no hint or suggestion of coming back to life or being saved by the Prophets. Arguably DS9's biggest long term theme was ""this is what it takes for the Federation to build and manifest their ideology after the first contact and diplomacy ships leave."" DS9 shows a lot of what it takes including the occasional deaths. Yet none of these deaths have really hit home including Jadzia Dax or Tasha Yar and that's because we know that the actors were leaving the show for personal reasons and it being less about a natural flow of story. But if Sisko really died at the end we would be sitting here and saying DS9 deliberately showed us what kind of hard choices and sacrifices it takes to keep the Federation, this humanist future, going with the lead character of a series. That people (aliens included in that word) may and do die with their eyes wide open to keep the ideology alive because it's a way of life worth preserving and living in not just for oneself but for everyone you love and even those you don't. Instead we are left with this imo completely ""Meh, he'll be back probably..."" ending that to me really doesn't have a lesson or theme to it.",🤔 Two Really Big Missed Opportunities In DS9
1,"Hello all, 

I have a dilemma (see captivating title). 13 years ago, when I was a youth, I was a dumb kid (see captivating title). I was entrusted with my aunt’s keys so I could come and go while she was gone. I opted to stay at my boyfriend’s a few nights, and was picked up before she returned. When I gave her keys back, she screamed at me. On her keys, was a Ferengi keychain from Star Trek: The Experience, with Rule of Acquisition #21: “Never place friendship before profit” on it. It was gone. Fallen, no doubt, while I was galavanting around as a careless youth. We searched everywhere. His apartment, the parking lot, all of the grounds. She didn’t speak to me for a week. 
Fast Forward: I’ve been searching for this keychain on and off for years with ZERO luck.  With covid-19 coming around, and my aunt and I now both being healthcare workers, I resumed my search, in hopes to brighten out spirits. My sheer chance, I found a seller on Facebook! He mailed me the keychain for a low price. I was ECSTATIC. Unfortunately, it was premature. I received the envelope, but the corner was torn off, and the product was gone. I made many frantic calls to my post office, his, and mail recovery. They don’t hold on to “trinkets”. I’m devastated, folks. So I’m turning to here. And everywhere. To try to find this damn keychain! I have a picture of it, but I can’t figure out how to get it to post. I can tell you that it’s from Star Trek: The Experience. Round. Ferengi. If anyone can help, or share this everywhere, I have all the love for you. I’d pay a pretty penny to bring her a smile! 

Thanks!!

1,"I get it - Discovery and Picard are intended to draw more casual fans into the show. And while there's plenty of fan service easter eggs throughout both series with great levels of attention to detail, ignoring certain major canon remains an unacceptable oversight.

1. In Picard, no reference was made of Data's first daughter Lal, or his brother Lore. To me, this detracted from the strength of the overall plot and characters. Heck, Lore played a major part of Hugh's experiences in Descent I and II!

2. While Chabon acknowledged the Dominion War behind-the-scenes, no mention of it was made on-screen in Picard which detracts from the the world building as well as Picard's experiences with evacuating the Romulans, standing up for their rights, etc. Not only does it discredit DS9, but in past Trek shows, references to other not-shown wars and events were often made (Earth-Romulan War, Federation-Cardassian War, World War III, Eugenics War, etc.)

3. Some of Discovery's marketing materials had Burnham listed as ""first black lead"" doing Avery Brooks/Benjamin Sisko a major disservice again to DS9.

1,"Rewatching this episode post-Picard it’s like they took this one episode and built Picard’s principles around synths for the show from it. 

Maddox says he wants to create “hundreds maybe thousands” of Datas and Picard challenges him to consider that if they are a race how they will be viewed and treated if they are not considered sentient, and how humans will be viewed based on that. 

It is the same argument Picard essentially makes through season 1; to Starfleet after the incident, to Synths, and to Soji.

1,"Let me start by saying I love Star Trek.  I’ve basically found ways to justify every series and movie.  Yes god had use for a Star ship!  

I enjoyed every series including Enterprise which was just staring to hit its stride when it was canceled.  I love the original series/crew and movies. I liked the first reboot film of this crew as well and felt they could have built a really cool different legacy in the different timeline but was really disappointed by the 2nd one and very meh in the 3rd.  

Kirks crew were part of my childhood and that crew will always be special for me.  If they don’t come back I’m good with it.  It seems a shame the reboot crew never got the 5 year mission(RIP Anton :( ). 

TNG was also amazing and I consumed all of it, including the movies DS9, Voyager.  Recently I watched Picard, and while it’s not TNG, it was nice to see a post TNG world.  It doesnt have the magic that TNG had, but I like some elements of it very much.  I felt like they should have explored 7 of 9 going to the dark side. That moment got me nerd giddy at the possibility of her as the queen. Maybe something for the future.  Also why waste Hugh?...

I’m also not sure I like the daughter, which makes me sad because Data is one of the greatest characters of all time.  Season 2 will be huge.  For me, it made me appreciate TNG because your exploring the Picard and Data missions that are so important to Picards overall story now.  

Now for Discovery...I’m three episodes in and must say.. What am watching here?  Robots on the bridge in this era?  Mind melds create infinite conversations now at anytime? Mutiny?  Firing first?  Those are Klingons?!  What in the Worf am I watching?

Ok I like some things about the gatherings but why do they all sound like they have congestion?  Why are they all bald now?  They are shiny and sparkly now but they lost all the substance and flavor that was so incredible in TNG and DS9 storylines.  

As far as the new crew, not sure what to think of Michael but she’s growing on me.  The rest of the crew is kinda blah for me.  Nobody stands out as of yet, not even tall dude and I always like Doug Jones.  Not feeling this story either.  Hoping it gets better...

That being said, I pushed on. Started the Finale last night and I don't even know where to begin with how bad it was.

---------------------

Anyway here the rough idea and plot:

It's the mid 25th century. Guinan recognized for her wisdom and good counselling is working at the main Starfleet medical unit for mental health as a therapist (yes she had to get certified still) helping officers with anxiety and other emotional challanges.

Guinan goes home to her condo after work in San Francisco and as she is getting ready to sleep, she gets ""a feeling"" something is in the air. She starts looking around the house and doesn't know what's wrong but she knows something is up. Next thing you know, Q shows up

Q says long time no see. They argue a bit about their past (I won't spoil the details here) and then Q reveals why he's there.

Q says the humans continue to advance faster than any of them thought possible and are crutial for future events in the Universe to unfold as they predict (never explains exactly what it is that humans are supposed to accomplish in the far far future). In the shorter term they are also critical to save the galaxy from a more immediate threat both to themselves and the rest of the Federation and Galaxy, the Borg which remain a powerful foe.

In recent decades the Borg not only fully repaired and restored their transwarp network destroyed by Voyager, but are stronger than ever assimilating the galaxy at a rate like never before and humans with the aid of other species and allies in the powerful Federation are the only species both powerful enough but also adaptable and creative enough with solutions to battle such a foe

Q warns that if humanity is gobbled up by the Borg things will not happen as they must. Q reminds Guinan that she knows very well what's at stake for the Universe (once again Q does not specify what he means, but Guinan seems to know what he's talking about)

Guinan begins to argue that the Q continuum should just do something about it and snap the Borg out of existance despite Qs insistance that his hands are tied and the rules from the continuum do not allow him to simply take such a species out of existance just like that without specific rare reasons and that warning humanity on a need to act on the Borg was his only indirect loophole he could take in their destruction (if not destruction, at least partial suppression, or kept under control)

Q states that the reason he chose to contact her of all people is not only because she now has a career and history with Starfleet as a very trusted member that can relay the message and taken seriously, but Guinan also understands what's fundamentally at stake for the future like no one else in the Federation, tho she cannot reveal everything she knows Q is talking about to Starfleet or the Federation

This story I have in mind would not only involve a lot of battle scenes since it's against the Borg... But the story would reveal a lot of mysteries about what the Q are, and what Guinans species fundamentally are too and what their connection with the Q is as well. 

However some details of the history of the Q and Guinan and the El-Aurians and who they fundamentally are would still remain ambiguous. This story would only be a progression in our understanding of those mysterious beings, and further hints that humanity will one day in the far inconceivable future (like Q once told Riker) will one day be a major race not just in the Galaxy but in the Universe and surpass the Q. However again, it will not ruin what that mystery is because the story will only make ambiguous hints, not actually outright reveal everything.

Like, how did this human clone get so much power? How'd he become a leader of an entire alien race of people in such a short period of time? Why does the slave race, the Remens, have such advanced technology in comparison to the Romulans? Why do the Romulans fear him? Why are the Romulans so nice the the Enterprise at the end?

Then there were smaller issues, like with the star ship battle itself. Yeah, it was cool. It was cool as fuck. However, before Picard rams into the ship he asks if he can concentrate his phasers. Geordi, or someone, say, ""They're shields are at 70%."" If the shields are at 70% Picard would be ramming into the shields. Not the ship itself.",Nemesis impressions

1,"Watching Data try to navigate a romantic relationship is absolutely comical, especially given his obliviousness to any social queues.

I understand this could just be to keep mystery alive as a plot device but has there ever been an in-universe explanation? I know in Discovery there is faked footage of Spock but if possible forgery/ unreliability was the issue then asking the computer where so and so was at a specific time would also be prone to the same issues but the do that throughout.

Who should they use from the new voice now that she has passed and they will need a new voice for that role? A main actor from one the past shows? An actor that played one of the side characters? Maybe someone that was a behind the scenes creative force?

The only series I haven't whatched straight thru is TOS. I've seen a few episodes at random but I've tried to sit thru the whole thing and I struggle with how dated the production and effects are.

The series follows the crew of the USS Discovery as they encounter new worlds and civilizations, delving into familiar themes and expanding upon an incident that has been talked about within the franchise's universe, but never fully explored.""

* **Star Trek**: Enterprise (2151-2161)
* **Star Trek** Discovery (2255)
* **Star Trek** (2265-2269)

I don’t understand why people are taking such issue to the tactics of terrorism even when used by a subjugated people against a brutal occupation: of course it’s justified. Certainly terrorism is a morally complex issue but that’s the whole point of DS9. Condemning Kira just because “she was a terrorist” is really shallow analysis and I’m actually quite surprised at the number of Star Trek DS9 fans who hold that view when the whole point of the show is moral ambiguity. It’s a similar situation with the Maquis: we aren’t supposed to just condemn them out of hand as terrorists and yet that’s the stance people are taking, unhappy that the show seems to be justifying terrorism. Maybe it’s just because the idea of having figures who are morally grey isn’t in tune with our contemporary political discussions which either valorize or demonize people.",What’s with all the hate for Kira Nerys?

1,"S1E9 - Hide and Q

As a preface, I am watching through TNG for the first time and am sharing my running thoughts while watching each episode.

So we start off the episode by learning that the Enterprise is on their way to save 504 severely injured people, and they’re prepared for them all. Holy cow that is just insane to me. I guess I don’t comprehend how large the Enterprise really is. 

Worf pouring out his drink from Q was great. The reasoning was explained as a Klingon code: “Thou shall not drink with thy enemy.” Might have liked it more without the explanation honestly. 

Q’s Penalty Box. Might be a cool name for a bar or maybe a band?

The reason Q goes after Riker instead of Picard is because Q thinks Picard is too competent basically. Riker definitely falls more susceptible to Q’s charm but to be fair his challenge was much more difficult than Picard’s. 

Data once again proved how strong he was when he was tossing cinderblocks like they were foam (which they probably are haha)

Deepest wishes list:

Data - to become human

Wes - to be 10 years older. That’s not what Wil Wheaton looks like irl haha

Geordi - to see. Hey it really is LeVar under that mask!

Worf - wants a Klingon wife. Apparently Klingon sex is crawling?

Riker - wanted Q’s power

All of them rejected these wishes as the human way is to strive for more and earn things themselves. I hate to disagree but I think a lot of people would take their deepest wishes at the snap of a finger. But under those circumstances I can see why they all declined.

“Ji’Zya sector, location of the first major conflict between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets in the year 2191, has been hotly contested since, with battles occurring most notably in 2212, 2223, and 2245. The last major battle occurred in 2245 at Donatu V, the battle proved just as inconclusive as the prior three. Both the Federation and Klingons lay claim to the worlds within the sector, Donatu V, Sherman’s Planet, and the Gsynerria system. The Federation operates a deep space station, K-7, within the sector, while the Klingons also operate an outpost.”

Star Trek Picard doesn't necessarily have to be *permanently* set in this post-Nemesis era.  Each season could be set in a different time period (a la Archer jumping around, *but not as absurd*).  We could have a season that covers the Academy years, another season that covers the Stargazer years, and so forth and etc...

1,"I've noticed a lot of conflicting love and hate remarks with replicators over the series of Star Trek

I remember in TNG when they were carrying the primative farmers the guy loved the whiskey from the replicator. There have also been other times when they praised the quality of the replicators.

But then have also been many instances where characters showed frustration with replicators and their quality

- Tom Paris on the first episode of Voyager was unimpressed with the quality of the tomato soup

- Deanna Troy did not like the ""nutritionally enhanced"" ice cream and wanted real ice cream

- In the new Star Trek Picard they have consistently jabbed at how the the quality of the taste of replicated food is inferior especially in episode 7 when Picard meets Deanna and Riker on the planet

- I also remember the officer who defected to the Maquis in DS9 (forget his name now) sh*t talking how crappy replicator food was like no tomorrow when they were in the shuttle craft


With all the criticism the replicators have had they have also been hailed at times. Would that be from people that don't know real food just like how some kids these days hail frozen food? I remember loving frozen pizza as a little kid for example until tasting REAL Pizza could it be a simmilar thing? But then again the primative man did love the whiskey

Also the fact that they still farm in the future and Picard grows grapes suggests there has so be some kind of demand for real food. If real food wasn't better why farm at all? Or could it be to conserve power?

 We do know that replicators require A LOT of energy (Voyager often had to ration replicators when power reserves were down even more than holodecks). Could it be challanging to supply billions in a planet with replicated food alone so farming was still required?

So I guess I'm asking 2 questions here. Is their quality truly inferior to real food? and why farm still if food can be replicated? Thoughts",Replicators... Loved Or Hated? Why?
1,"I have been a Star Trek Fan since I was 9 years old. It started with my dad whatching Star Trek Voyager which I was instantly hooked on. I rewhatched every re-run of Voyager constantly and years later once streaming online became a thing started whatching it yet again

I did branch out into other Star Treks too. The Next Generation was the second one I whatched which I really liked as well (tho not as much as Voyager at the time), then Star Trek Enterprise when it came out, eventually I gave Deep Space 9 a chance even tho I innitially refused to whatch it finding it boring (I honestly think now its actually my favorite) and I've whatched every movie (all 13 both from TOS and The Next Generation and the new modern ones), and the new series Discovery and Picard (I love Picard btw) but it all started with Voyager

But the last several years I have an ever growing love/hate relationship with Voyager each time I give it a little whatch and now as I got older (I'm turning 27 in a month) because in many ways it seems like the most badly done of all the star treks and I'm sorry but I'm about to go on a rant:

#1 Captain Janeway can't act to save her life. It was especially bad in the first couple seasons. She was very stiff and very extra and her lines seemed so forced. It did get better in the later seasons but only ""acceptable"" she never became great in my opinion

#2 The characters and cast were super dry. Harry Kim, Kes &amp; Chakotay were literally plain dry toast with no personality. Tuvok gets a pass because Vulcans are supposed to be that way but when half the cast is already boring to begin with adding a lifeless Vulcan makes it intolerable. The characters all were overly formal and sounded over rehearsed

The characters that DID have personality often had the other extreme of having too much like they were making up for the lifeless cast. Neelix and the Doctor in particular were way too extra. Between Chakotay, Kes, Harry and Tuvok being too dry, Neelix &amp; the Doctor being too extra, and Captain Janeway being a terrible actress... Tom Paris is the only character I tolerated and Balana Torris and 7 of 9 the only 2 characters I genuinely liked

#3 They constantly threw obvious issues under the rug when they didn't want to deal with it in the plot. As if it wasnt obvious that there's no way for example that the Maquis crew would blend in so nearly perfectly into a Starfleet crew with minimal problems for example. Yeah a couple episodes early on touched on the tension between the crew but they moved on unrealistically quickly from that.

#4 the contradictions never end. Whether it's the limited number of torpedoes they supposibly had never running out despite use all series long without them ever explaining how they overcame the problem of their production, or there being enough deaths over the entire series to kill a limited sized crew that can't be replaced 2 times over. Like come on


It also got on my nerves to see Neelix and Kes so frequently in senior officers meetings. Like why is the Chef/Cook and trainee nurse always there? Just cuz they are part of the main cast doesn't mean u gotta throw them in when it doesn't make sense.

Basically as a huge trekie that first got introduced to the Star Trek Universe (and science fiction in general) thanks to Star Trek Voyager, and considered it my fav show in general, I now consider it one of the weakest if not the most poorly done of all the Star Trek series (excluding obvious shortcoming like TOS graphics of the times obviously)

I will say that at least it had my favourite looking ship and I did like the frequent encounters with the Borg if that counts for anything",As An Old Star Trek Fan Looking Back... Voyager Gets On My Nerves
1,"*Discussing: S01E02, ""Yesteryear"" from the 1970s animated series.*

In the episode, adult Spock saves the child version of himself by going into the past. The episode claims that if adult Spock didn't save the child version of him via time travel, then Spock would have died young and never grown up to join the Starship Enterprise.

How is that possible? If the only way for young Spock to live is through an adult Spock saving him, then without adult Spock he would never grow old to become adult Spock??

Anyways, is it me or does the technology between TOS and TNG onwards seem rather similar? They're set a hundred years apart.

Why is it, though, that it always has to be Janeway who is the hero?

I also love the way this was set up seasons ago with the Kes episode where she is going backwards in time.

Still, a couple of things:

1) Didn't Kes tell them what the frequency was? I know she did as she moved backwards in time, but surely she would have told them as she started moving forwards. Yes. I know they said certain things should not be disclosed, but why would they not disclose the frequency of the torpedo?

2) Obviously there was a change in that now it was Seven that finally found the frequency and not Kes... I guess this is just showing different possible timelines.","Voyager ""The Year of Hell"""

There is a major difference between DS9’s darkness and Discovery’s/Picard’s darkness. DS9 treated its serious topics seriously. During that episode where Obrian was implanted with fake memories, O’Brien’s experience as a prisoner is taken seriously, and his prison lifestyle, his increased agitation and his inability to change or move on nearly makes him commit suicide. All of this is taken seriously. When Nog came back after loosing his leg at the siege of AR-558, he essentially had PTSD, and sealed himself away in a holosuite with Fontaine to get away from everything. The topic isn’t joked about, glorified, or just used casually, it is a serious matter taken seriously by the show. Speaking of, the Siege of AR-558 isn’t some Vietnam war movie, where their mowing down the Vietcong with a machine gun mounted to a Huey. It is a horrible thing, where people die, where Nog, a person close to being a child, loses his leg. It’s dirty, it’s grim, it’s dark, but most importantly it was serious. In fact, Star trek’s worst episodes were when they didn’t take topics or themselves seriously, take Profit and Lace, Code of honor, etc.

Nutrek however doesn’t take anything seriously. Suicide is just referenced casually(“why didn’t I just put a phaser to my head and end it all?”-Seven of Nine “I think about suicide every day”-Agnes and I think there are at least three scenes of suicide). While you would think ptsd would be taken seriously, notably Picard’s with the borg, its forgotten about after a few minutes. If modern producers made DS9, we would have seen a 2 minute scene of Bashir fucking butchering Nogs leg and then another two minute scene of the fake leg being shoved up the gored leg, but since the show was mature, it didn’t glorify violence. DS9 didn’t want violence to happen, it was still Star Trek, when battles were shown it was a struggle and during Sacrifice of angels, getting back DS9 was almost a phyrric victory, and when they finally won and were on Cardasia, only Martok drank, while Sisko(who would have, out of anyone, a justifiable hatred for Cardasians) says, “That May be the case, but that does not mean I have to toast over their dead bodies.” Meanwhile in Discovery, “I want to here you scream”. When DS9 talked about means to an end, such as in the pale moonlight, the entire episode is devoted to the topic. It deals with the struggle of the people involved and the sacrifices you have to make to save lives, even if they seem immoral. Discovery went, “ACTION! IM GONNA FUCKING STAB YOU, FUCK YOOOOOOOU” and then realized they needed to have a, “moral dilemma” so they placed a bomb on Qo’noS and then had Michael go, “we cAn’T BloW UP ThE planeT, tHERE’s liKe, PeOplE HEre anD StuFf.” It makes me sad to see that something made by Seth Macfarland takes more seriousness than an official Star Trek production.",Why darkness worked in DS9 and why I’m sick of hearing it as an excuse
1,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Star Trek Picard and the Star Trek fandom as a whole a lot lately, and I realized that so many feel that they either have to love something unconditionally or hate it. As a life long Star Trek fan, I’m only a teen but my dad got me started on TNG when I was 4/5, I really liked Star Trek Picard. It did have two outstanding flaws in my opinion, however. 

Flaw 1 is simpler to explain, the show was just paced extremely weird, the first 3 episodes felt like they could fit into one, yet later episodes felt like they would benefit from being allocated more time. Using extra time gained from tinkering the pacing could be used to insert some more Trekky character moments that a lot of people, including my self, want. 

Flaw 2 is more broad. There were a lot of really, really, really, really stupid decisions. These decisions didn’t have much of an impact on story imo, but just generally felt out of place. Examples of these for me would be the overabundance of Disco style shuttles, the copy paste fleet in the Finale, the death of Hugh, the overly grotesque Icheb scene, etc. As I said, these don’t really impact the story, and some, for me the Icheb scene, didn’t strike me as all that bad, but looking back on these areas, it seems like they were either just lazy and asking for backlash. 

Overall, however, I liked Picard and like New Star Trek as a whole. I just hope future series put some work into the whole pacing thing and I really think Picard going forward and Disco going forward may begin to compare to some of the greatest sci fi ahows(DS9, Babylon 5, and the new Battlestar)",My take on Picard.

So my question comes from what I'm familiar with from TNG to DS9 since that is what I saw when I was a child (tells you my age). Is it possible that V'Ger possibly created or encountered the Borg before it's contact with Kirk and company?

1,"I haven't thought through all the details but I was thinking about something with the best of both worlds so how about something that really pushes the boundaries of interstellar travel - some sort of huge starship which is a cross federation crew and science mission to go much further than ever before - perhaps to try to plant transwarp conduits, but the key is to go far further outside of the space we have ever seen before, something truly weird and alien that really requires a show of the scope of the sheer size of space. A multi species crew, an enterprise-y set up but a travelling ship of new design that is almost as much a travelling space station as it is a ship that can be part home, part factory, part base for scout ships - perhaps it's even longer, a ten year mission - something that really evokes going into the unknown like the Apollo program - but to add contrast you also have b plots set in the closer to home areas on earth or thereabouts dealing with federation politics and research and so on that can involve returning characters and smaller b plots. Perhaps the base station that is running the mission, geordi la forge and miles o Brien are running the program from earth, problems have to be solved from a distance like a mission control, and human stories as earth advances with other programs and politics. Haven't thought much more but any ideas to flesh it out welcome. Partly inspired by a pic I saw of a huge fantasy starship with a a saucer but just a huge block behind that felt like it could be some sort of huge monolithic Starfleet design. I might try sketching what I'm talking about to make it clearer.",Series Idea: a new five year mission and a home mission in parallel
1,"Odd watch order I know, but I went DS9 then Voyager, then TNG. When I was looking to get into it I was unsure and sometime asked for my likes and told me DS9 would be the best if I was only going to watch one. 

I liked TNG, but I think it's my least favorite out of what I've watched. Nevermind it's better than Voyager. But I really didn't feel the same connection like I did to DS9, or even parts of Voyager. DS9 has the best characters, and I like the breaks from episodic story telling. In terms of characters I respect Picard, I would love working for him, butb that's about it. Riker was ok. Jordi was meh, same for troi, and Beverly. Data was great, so was worf. And I liked ro laren, huge missed opportunity to put her on Voyager. Maybe because I watched what happened after TNG, and how they built on it is why it didn't hold the same feeling as DS9. Anyone else feel the same way, or is this sort of like trying to say fallout new Vegas isn't the best fallout?",Just finished watching TNG for the first time. My thoughts.
1,"Noob Trek 46 - A Piece Of The Action

My first thought was ""what a weird title"". It was evocative of nothing without any context, and I knew nothing about this episode going in.

And I'm glad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times and I mean that in a good way. After episodes like I Mudd, I thought I'd seen it all but this was another delightful curveball I never saw coming. Man, ANYTHING can happen on this show can't it?

Right away something's off when Kirk's asked to meet Okmyx (whose name I originally misheard as Ox Mix, which was interesting) by the ""yellow fire plug"". The contrast in tech between the Enterprise and the Ioatians is funny off the bat. And then bam, we're in a 1930's gangster film (though there's a lot of influences from 30s/40s crime cinema, Little Caesar seems to be a particular reference here.) And it's a great job too, with the thug actors hamming it up, and drivebys, fistfights, cards, even some molls. Integrating the sci-fi elements with this would seem to be a tall order, but it's an ingenious and really interesting premise - a starship crew left behind a book on earth history dealing with the Chicago mob era, the primitive locals became fascinated with it as an artifact of an advanced race, and modeled their civilization on it, it becomes their bible as McCoy says.

Anthony Caruso does a great job as crime boss Okmyx, but it kept bugging me - I'm sure I've seen him before, the name/face is familiar but I can't place it. Little touches, such as how the Federation are referred to ""the feds"" are hilarious . The sets are particularly good, and as a pinball nut I appreciated how they have some oldtime pinball machines in the gangster's rec room. When Kirk plays Calvinball with the cards appears to be when the episode just full on embraces the silliness and becomes an outright comedy. On the one hand I was a little miffed at the potentially serious side of the story which illustrates the importance of the prime directive being forgotten, but what we get is funny enough that I forgive it.

""What are the odds of getting a royal fizbin?""

""I've never computed them captain.""

Elements such as Jojo Krako's ""boss"" plaque and his dartboard of Okmyx make it clear that the show is in on the joke. I was laughing out loud when Spock and Kirk make the scene fully decked out as gangsters, and it's side splitting how ""Koik"" gradually turns into Edward G Robinson with ""Spocko"" reluctantly getting on the act (""I advise yas to keep diallin'"") and I was rolling in the aisles when he accidentally sends the car into reverse. It's great that legendary starship captain James T Kirk doesn't know how to drive. Even Scotty gets to threaten to put someone in concrete galoshes. Things just get nuttier and nuttier in this one.

The coda at the end of the episode even ties up the loose ends, as I was just thinking that how Kirk left things was irresponsible. I'm cutting myself short here - there's lots of other fun little moments I could type up but I won't be able to do them justice. A really pleasant surprise - when I realised what this episode was doing I was afraid it was going to be embarrassing but I couldn't have been more wrong. One of the funniest episodes yet that really blows open the parameters of what this show is ""allowed"" to do.","""A Piece Of The Action"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
1,"S1E8 - The Battle

We see the return of the Ferengi in this episode. Our first repeat alien species. Let’s dig in!

So Daimon Bok is immediately untrustworthy and yet they invite him on their ship. Isn’t there some sort of captain’s videoconferencing they can do? Social distancing, people!

We learned that the common cold has been cured. Their medical practices are obviously incredible if Dr. Crusher is so concerned about a headache. 

Captain Picard’s old ship, the Stargazer, was introduced to us. Apparently he destroyed a Ferengi ship with it after it attacked him. The truth of what actually happened at this battle is the mystery of the whole episode, which never really resolved. We are made to assume that Picard was defending the ship. 

So Wes took one look at a brain scan which he admittedly knows nothing about, and he recognizes it as the Ferengi message. That’s a stretch. They would have been absolutely destroyed by Picard in the Stargazer had Wesley not figured that out too. 

My favorite quote: “What is the defense for the Picard maneuver?”  “There isn’t one.” 

Also I enjoyed the bit at the end with the Ferengi first officer overthrowing his captain for not seeking a profit with his actions.",Star Trek TNG S1E8 Episode Discussion
1,"\*Spoiler for the Motion Picture\*

I just saw Star trek The Motion Picture, which I tremendously enjoyed, it's like a short story by Asimov (reminds me a bit of ""The Last Question""), the pacing drags a bit in the beginning, the film could do with 10 or 20 minutes less, but overall it was great. I'm just left wondering, could what the new species that Decker and Vger turn into at the end of the film, be the Q continuum? The Q did say they once were like humans, they see to know everything, just like Vger, and Spock even says at the end that the last thing Vger learned was emotions, the Q with all their superiority seem to be highly emotional beings, heck, they even look human. I know it's probably not the intention, and there might be an official source explaining where the Q came from and what happened to VGER, but I like to believe they are the same species.

P.S. Was the name Voyager from Star Trek Voyager chosen in reference to this film?",Could VGER be the birth of the Q?

It's one of the only Worf-centric episodes that doesn't revolve around either Empire politics or something to do with honor and being a Klingon.  All of the changes in the parallel universe, whether minor or major (welcome back, Wesley), were fun to catch.

Instead of waiting for the next season of Discovery I started the original series and honestly I can't get into it. It's full of strippers, psychics, and cowboys and after seeing Enterprise and Discovery its almost comical how silly it is (Enterprise and Discovery were all about navigating complex moral dilemmas and I have seen none of that in the originals). I'm super excited for TNG, DS9 and Voyager but I have to make it through the originals first because I'm all about chronology. Will it get better?",Will It Get Better?
1,"In Star Trek 7, when the echo of Guinan told Picard, that he may leave the nexus if he wishes to, she just told him what pleased him. She is part of the nexus after all. So Picard experiences the triumph over Soran (ST7), retaliates against the Borg (ST8), becomes younger and falls in love (ST9), opens up romulan isolation (ST10), takes care of the family wineyard and after being tired of that, he goes out again for a new kind of adventure (Star Trek Picard). All that with its fair portion of excitement and drama, because Picard wouldn't want it any other way. He lives his personal paradise inside the nexus.

This idea is highly improbable of course and would be an insult to the fans, but there are some of Trekkies, who have a very strong opinion about the show. Maybe this idea is some kind of white lie. Something they can appease their anger with.

1,"Now I haven't watched all the movies yet so don't spoil those for me please lol

Ok so I think I just have to share a bit of my thoughts and confusions

- I ended on the original series, now I liked the ending but it didn't really feel like a finale it felt more of just a normal episode which is wierd

- everyone I know that has watched a lot of star trek and I am just curious why most people don't like enterprise, like it's not my favorite or anything but I enjoyed it but most people seem to just be content with it and I can't seem to figure out why

- I think Voyager might have been my favorite but I don't know for sure I really liked them all

- the ending of Voyager was very strange as they got back to earth and that was it and the show ended right then and there with no like epilogue I guess, like what happened to everyone?

- I really liked ds9 as it felt different since it was on a station instead of a ship

- I have absolutely no complaints about TNG I really enjoyed it but it didn't seem to have a big overarching story that was shown a lot (I like big stories because they make me feel like there is something being built up to like I'm Voyager) but I did like all the episodes by themselves and it seems like a great show to just turn on anytime on any episode and pick up in the plot easily

- I doubt there is an explanation for this but why did kayless in the original series show up as a genetically altered Klingon?

Ok I have more thoughts that I can't think of as I am bad at writing my opinions well, I haven't been on this sub long so I don't know if is should make a post like this. Also I wierd thing I noticed was that all of these shows were aired before I was born except near the end of Enterprise (I'm only 15)

I'd love to hear what you all have to think about all this and I wanna know if Discovery and Picard are worth watching so I can know if I should try to get all access or not

Thanks for reading :)",Alright so I have just finished watching all of star trek except Discovery and picard
1,"Like she seems too moody to play a war veteran (since she was a refugee that joined Starfleet) or fit into the more epic scale of DS9 (hard for me to imagine how the clashes with Weyoun or Dukat would’ve gone).

But on the other hand she does seem like a better actor (Atleast for the first 1-2 seasons), but maybe that would only show on TNG bc of the circumstances (ie being on a Galaxy Class ship VS dealing with the myriad of non-federation factions from the deck of a space station).

Like she seems more convincing as an actor, but I’m not sure how that specific portrayal would’ve been done to fit DS9.",What would of it been like if Ro Laren was on DS9?

1,"Noob Trek 44 - The Trouble With Tribbles

I know this episode! At least I know it's premise. I don't know \*how\* I know this - I've certainly never seen it before as I had seen no Trek before beginning this marathon - but I knew the basic story before watching it, that the Enterprise becomes overrun with a bunch of seemingly harmless fluffballs called Tribbles that breed lightning fast. Racking my brain, I \*think\* I'm aware of this because I was a huge fan of Gremlins, and this was cited as an influence on that.

I love the misdirection at the beginning. This entire episode is a bait and switch - we're lead to expect a confrontation with the klingons, with a whole bunch of politics and protocol and posturing upfront. Kind of like I Mudd, which has a dry opening before becoming very silly indeed, this also goes for a gradual and entirely deliberate 180 in tone. The gag is of course that the silly little tribbles come closer to causing mission failure on the part of Kirk than the aggressive warlike Klingons ever have. The I Mudd comparisons are Apt - this in fact feels like a Mudd episode. I wouldn't be surprised if it was written as one and Carmel was unavailable or something, Cyrano feels like a Mudd stand in. I don't mind Stanley Adamas as Cyrano, he's fine, and does well in the bar fight scene as he amusingly enjoys his drinks while everything goes to hell around him, but I think Carmel might have done it even better.

I recognize Trelane, William Campbell from Squire Of Gothos immediately. Much as I like Campbell though, he feels miscast as a Klington, much too arch and spry. It would have been nice to bring back Kor from Errand Of Mercy and have Kor and Mudd team up and possibly have their own spin off together. In fact, to my surprise, the Klingons seem to be getting \*less\* like the klingons I know with each appearance. In Errand Of Mercy they had makeup and more of a sense of an alien culture, in Friday's Child they just looked like people and now in The Trouble With Tribbles they look like people and behave a lot like them too. I suppose the lack of makeup is actually a plot point here for Darvin to pass as a human, but still, I like my Klingons like I like my coffee - not closely resembling a human being.

This episode is absolutely packed with quotable lines, so many I don't think I can even list them all.  ""My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee"" stands out. A lot of them come from Kirk squaring off with Baris - something about Baris just rubs Kirk the wrong way - maybe because he's a bureaucrat who doesn't appreciate the military wing of Starfleet and thinks it is just there to serve him. In any event, Kirk suddenly transforms into a class clown, firing off zingers every time Baris appears on the screen. Kirk doesn't have all the laughs though, one of my favourite moments was Spock boasting of how Vulcans are immune to the charms of tribbles as he begins to stroke one. I also loved how Scotty didn't mind all the insults about Kirk, but as soon as someone has a go at his ship he's ready to fight. ""I'm sorry, the Enterprise shouldn't tow garbage, it should be towed as garbage"" was pretty good too. This also leads into the interesting sight of Kirk dressing down his men for a ""small disturbance"" and leads into this classic exchange:

Scotty: They said you were an overbearing swaggering dictator with illusions of godhood.

Kirk: Is that all?

Other favourite moments are Kirk sitting on the tribble in his command chair, and of course what I now know to the iconic scene of Kirk becoming buried in tribbles. It's not dwelt on as this is a humorous story, but it was nice to see a serious side brought in, as there are ecological undercurrents to Spock explaining to Cyrano the dangers of removing animals from their natural habitats. If Spock is correct though, that means the tribbles live on a badass planet where they get killed all the time - do we ever go there?

Gripes? No shot of Campbell on the klingon ship overrun with tribbles, boo, I really wanted that. Also it's a bit slow - things like the barfight and dressing down, while entertaining, seemed to run long and there wasn't as much tribble insanity as I wanted - this may be due to the tribbles needing to be stationary for production reasons, so when they're just lying there they can't do that much. Finally, is Baris right? Didn't Kirk actually goof up by letting grain get destroyed? That it's poisoned is beside the point, Kirk still failed to defend it despite him knowing that tribbles were about.

However, I still really liked it, plenty of laugh out loud moments, and unlike I Mudd which was just nuts, this has a decent stab at combining a regular, sober Star Trek setting/story with the wacky hi-jinks, giving it a different sort of flavour which I appreciated. I hope we see the tribbles again soon!","""The Trouble With Tribbles"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
1,"I mean they literally send the Enterprise to negotiate every dispute at the neutral zone, even though any one of them could result in a full scale war. How incompetent can Starfleet be? Yeah it's the most advanced ship but they're putting families and children in unnecessary danger. I know a lot of the plotholes with regards to this have been pointed out before and most are chalked up to Starfleet's hubris, but there's a fine line between hubris and utter idiocy and Starfleet must have discovered transwarp a couple years early to get as far past that line as they did. It also reflects really poorly on the crew.


For example in the Descent two patter Beverly acting as captain flys the Enterprise into a sun, A SUN! Without knowing if the expirimental shielding will hold, it's okay to take a risk like this if your on a ship with your own crew, but if there are children aboard with their families, it's the type of risk you shouldn't really be taking.


I just needed to get this off my chest. I know the writers have said that they regret that aspect of the Enterprise D but damn, they basically avoid the semantics of it in every episode until they decide they need it as a plot device.


Thinking about this does however add a lot of weight to some of the decisions made in the show. For example at the end of 'Best of Both Worlds', right before Data is about to free Picard from the Collective, Riker is about to warp the Enterprise into the Borg Cube to ensure the safety of humanity. It seems like this really big decision when you realise he's about to sacrifice his whole crew to save humanity. But it shows he's got some iron clad balls when you realise he's about to sacrifice every innocent civilian on the Enterprise and in the circumstances its unfortunately probably the right decision.


But yeah, Starfleet are idiots.",Just a reminder that

""Who Watches the Watchers"" is becoming one of my favorite episodes; I find the scenes between Picard and Nuria very moving. The plot bears some thematic similarity to the poignance of Galaxy Quest.

&amp;nbsp;

On my most recent watch, I noticed that there are a few strange parallels between Ray Wise's character, Liko, and his character on Twin Peaks, Leland Palmer. Beyond the minor sound-similarity of the names, both characters interact with otherworldly beings and experience inexplicable and seemingly supernatural events, which change their lives and make them stand apart in their communities. Liko's only relative is his daughter, and he mourns his late wife, obsessing over Picard's power to revive the dead, while Leland obsessively mourns his dead daughter. What's more, in TNG there's a lot of hubbub about the stranded anthropologist, ""Palmer,"" (cf. the Palmer family) whom Liko heard Picard mention in his experience in Enterprise sickbay. 

&amp;nbsp;

The episode aired on October 6th, 1989. Twin Peaks premiered on April 8th, 1990.

1,"S1E7 - Justice

I thought this episode was sort of boring. Not too much happened. But let’s get to it. 

If a world or situation seems too good to be true, it probably is. Thankfully Picard seemed aware of that right off the bat when dealing with Edo. 

There was a lot of discussion about the Edo people including their social practices but they left out the most important thing somehow in their studies because they didn’t learn about their punishment? It doesn’t really make sense that they wouldn’t know about their capital punishment policy. Also they were talking about sexual these Edo people are and yet they still send Wesley who is immediately overwhelmed and gets himself in trouble.

What are the benefits to their idea that any one who commits any crime is executed? Well it saves costs on the justice system and prisons I suppose. Edo’s entire justice system is apparently two Mediators running up to you and slipping you some night-night juice. Quick and easy. On the downside, it’s incredibly unfair. 

That had to be quite the amazing experience for the girl from Edo to be able to see her God up close. I’m surprised she was even able to speak. 

Also I had an alternative solution for the Enterprise to use. Why not dress up one of crew as their “God” in human form. Maybe Geordi in disguise could do this. Then just beam him down and demand the release of Wes?

Overall, I felt the message of the episode was summarized well by Riker at the end: “When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?”. This is why each situation is handled case-by-case and not every outcome will be the same.",Star Trek TNG S1E7 Discussion

It wasn't cool growing up and although I was/am a big nerd at the time I felt it better to keep that part of myself in the closet along with my sexuality and try to instead be a manly cool guy. Well that was dumb and I am much happier as a gay Trekkie, however my star trek endeavors have been quite lonely since my partner nor any of my friends like it as much as I do, and I never have anyone to talk to about it with or share Star trek humor with, just me contemplating the meaning of Temba, with his arms wide by myself. Then I found you all and the loneliness fell. The posts and comments make me happy and I can't wait to one day go to a convention and really be a part. Thank you everyone!",My Star Trek Journey
1,"I just finished all of Picard which was a struggle for me as I had just finished watching TOS - TNG - DS9 - and voyager in that order.  I am no a fan of the single story line stretched out in to an entire season still so that already had a down vote from the beginning for me but I wanted to watch more star trek and enterprise wasn't going to work for me.

\*possible spoilers\*

I feel the writers I had never seen star trek or didnt care for its lore as they changed everything.  There was heavy substance abuse, characters completely change and Picard kind of acted as a push over.  sevens  character specifically was drastically changed and turned into a lesbian all the sudden.  Agnes was hard to watch and always was staring off to space and I am not even sure why Raffi was there.  

I felt I would of liked this a lot more if it didnt carry the star trek name, but this universe did not feel like star trek nor did Picard feel like Picard.  There is a lot more issues I had but english not being my first language makes it difficult to pull out.",Star Trek Picard as bad as Discovery?

Oh: if you haven’t noticed Captain I out rank you.

Janeway: I thought you might say that. Consider this your leaving present.

Oh: Vice Admiral Janeway I thought you’d retired

Janeway: I got bored and thought I’d drop in on an old friend. Now get the hell out of this sector or we’ll destroy your fleet. These life forms are under federation protection. 

Oh: Starfleet doesn’t fire first

Janeway: Don’t you watch the news? We’re no longer Starfleet. Captain Riker target the commodore’s vessel and lock torpedoes. 

Today’s not the day to mess with us.",Alternate Picard finale scene
1,"Even though I’m new to the universe I’ve heard at or around 4 is when the show really kicks in to gear. But honestly what the actual f*** is going on before then? TNG had a reason for not being serialized and I suppose at least in the beginning DS9 needed to get everything set up before but by mid season 2 we know the characters and what’s going on. So WHAT THE F*** IS GOING ON?! 

Just watched episodes 14-16 of season 2 and they’re so disconnected and leave so many questions unanswered that I feel are kinda important to the story or at least to character development. 14 is when Bashir and O’Brian are supposedly killed in a planets attempt to stop civil war and they know about some bioweapon. 15 is when O’Brian is running from the station because everyone is acting weird. And 16 I’m in the middle of but just from the first few minutes I’m once again just like what the hell! 

Are the people from episode 14 coming back since Bashir and Brian were rescued by Sisko? They were adamant on killing them, even Sisko, because they know too much. Would they attack the station and start a war with the federation?

Episode 15 who are the Paradons, sorry if that’s spelled wrong, and how did Brian end up with the rebels? What happened when he was with the actual government? What are the rebels rebelling against? Were they negotiating peace with the rebels or another species? What about the rebels makes them more appropriate allies than the government? 

Episode 16 they just ignore everything that happened in the previous ones. Sure the Brian in the last episode was a “replicant” so anything that happened that we saw was not the actual perspective but still it seemed like everyone was against Brian and then boom this episode everything is just fine. 

I get it I do, none of that happened, and with the benefit of Netflix we don’t need to wait a week and that means no real disconnect that didn’t exist when the episode released. It’s still just so frustrating. We’re just supposed to accept that everything happened but also has no lasting impact on anything or anyone. 

Also one of the main criticisms I have for TNG where something happens then next episode it doesn’t matter, I.e. Lal Data’s daughter existing one episode then the next episode no one seems to care or mention her again except maybe once later in the shows seasons.",Frustrating discussion on DS9
1,"They had a perfectly written character from voyager and so many fans wanting to know what happened to her 

From the teasers of the show we all got the idea “omg finally after voyager we get to see”

None of it delivered 

Michael chabon (the show runner) is an absolute hack, the one thing he cared about was getting a Latino influence in rios, he said it himself in one of his Instagram QA sessions 

Seven could have been made into a martyr for the borg, or for voyager even! Yet she was somehow made into yet another good looking shelf piece for the new show. Talking about suicide? Wtf?

We deserve better as trekkies",They really wasted seven
1,This has always struck me as Sorta odd that janeway never chose to use warp ten to get home. It clearly was a working form of warp speed that could get them home in minutes. All that would of had to happen is the doctor instantly getting to work to keep them all from mutating. But is that really all thy hard? It seems clear in the episode that the longer you wait to treat it the more effort it takes but it’s never impossible. And once they are safe in earth orbit they can use the dozens of ship warp cores to quickly treat everyone and then there’s nothing else to worry about it.  So i see no reason why they wouldn’t use it if it works.,Why wasent warp 10 a usable way home for voyager?
1,"Picard season one was, in my opinion, pretty damn good. My only complaint with it would be just how focused it was on the concept of AI, while I agree that AI is something that people need to start talking about  the story itself wasn’t very Star Trek centric and I don’t feel that it properly explored Star Treks vast pre-existing universe. I don’t mind pre-existing lore not being the center of a Star Trek Story as I don’t think Star Trek should be an exclusionary lore circle-jerk, but I do want to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe. 


With Picard de-canonizing almost all of the lore for what’s happened after nemesis by its very nature, I’d love to get to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe, particularly what’s going on with some of the DS9 centric powers. I’d love to get to see Star Trek Picard season 2 show us a Bajor that’s either parted ways with the federation or straight out joined it, or a democratic Cardassia. What about the rest of the Romulan people, obviously some sort of government exists if the tal-shiar and Zhat-Vash still exist, what’s that like?


I guess what I’m trying to say is with season two of Picard, while we get more interesting Trek story lines I’d like to see this new era get a bit further fleshed out than what we got to see in season one.",What do you think Picard season 2 should explore

1,"The original series is my second favourite, next to TNG, but it does get a lot of flack for its overly-dramatic acting and a good deal of 'camp'.   
&amp;nbsp;  
William Shatner has been the butt of many jokes over the years, and has gained.. a.. certain reputation........ for his style, but look at the era and his background.   
&amp;nbsp;  
TOS was hot off the heals of so many classic dramatic and adventure films, and seems to have taken inspiration from a lot of the myth and epic movies before it, like *Jason and the Argonauts*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Hercules*.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Now when people ask me about Star Trek recommendations, I always tell them to imagine it is a stage play. This seems to contextualize the exaggerated acting and situations that seem a little more unorthodox, even for a Trek series (like actually meeting the Greek gods).    
&amp;nbsp;  
Not that it should matter, but this approach has really seemed to gain the series some respect, from *my* friends at least.

1,"Sometimes I get the sense that Q is always behind the scenes, kind of taking care of Picard or guiding him towards his destiny, or perhaps being the architect.

In season 6 episode 15, Picard is mortally wounded and would have most likely died, but Q intervenes and uses the moment to teach him a lesson and open his mind (by creating the time paradox), just like he tries to open his mind in the show finale. If Q had not sent Picard back in time in that moment, we already know that Picard would have lived a much less exciting life, he was only propelled into his destiny as a legendary captain because of Q's intervention. Plus Q probably made sure he didn't die from that blast as well.

I often feel like Q is disregarded as some powerful prankster, but I always had the sense that he was much more than that and had a significant impact on Picards life.",[Possible TNG spoilers] Q and Picard
1,"S1E6 Lonely Among Us

Some interesting character development in this episode. I’m looking forward to these more and more every day. 

Worf showed himself to be eager to learn when he was shadowing Geordi. Seems like he’s ambitious. He’s currently a Junior Lieutenant. We shall watch his career with great interest.  

We discovered that the Enterprise crew does not eat meat! I suppose that makes sense. Where would they keep the animals? Also on the topic of food, it was interesting to hear discussion about accommodating dietary requirements for the aliens that are visiting your ship. 

When the ship ‘malfunctioned’, Data says it’s a near impossible chance of this happening (from normal wear and tear). Good to know how good Star Fleet engineering is. Systems just do not fail on their own. 

As I side note I really liked the design of the Anticans. Haven’t seen them before. 

The discussion about private eyes and detective work was fun. Each episode of Star Trek is a mystery! That’s part of why we all tune in. Also Detective Data is my favorite Data so far. 

I can’t believe they killed off Singh in Engineering! Farewell, our plot necessary casualty. We knew you but for a minute. 

When Picard was controlled by the alien force, he said: “The search for knowledge is always our primary mission”. Based on last episode where he decided to get home rather than explore, that was definitely a clue that he wasn’t himself.",Star Trek TNG S1E6 Discussion

Worf taking away Kurn's identity and memory was an awful way for that storyline to end, imo. Not only was it not honorable, it was basically saying that there was no way for Kurn to get out of his current predicament, which I feel was a bad message. 

I mean, did Worf even get Kurn's permission to do that? I feel like its nor something that Kurn would agree to.

1," Full spoilers ahead for Picard.

They had five full movies worth of run time for Picard and I don't think they satisfyingly developed a single character in this supposedly character driven show. Narek and Soji bang within about five minutes of meeting on the cube and despite liking to have sex with each other being just about all they seem to have in common, I guess Narek loves her by episode five which couldn't be more than a couple of weeks in their time assuming the first time we see Soji at the end of episode one is when Picard sets off to find her.

How they introduced Raffi feels a lot like how Mr Poopeybutthole is shown to apparently have been a real character that participated in past events in Rick and Morty. I get that it makes sense that there would be people Picard would have met in the past couple of decades, but that level of chuminess and amount of inferred history really felt awkward to me for a character we'd never seen before. That quickly glossed over backstory coupled with how quickly they also introduce Raffi's son and move past it and then her very sudden apparent relationship with 7 makes it feel almost like parody levels of ridiculous.

The evil Soji/Dajh character at the end with the Data skin I felt must have had about ten total minutes of screen time(maybe it was more, I think my eyes glazed over and I lost all sense of reality at multiple points watching this show) and yet she ends up being one of the most important antagonists. These synthetics are apparently insanely intelligent and her most of all considering she just randomly deduced that the warning to biological organisms might actually be a message to synthetics and had the ability to mind meld, but she wasn't smart enough to avoid being recorded stabbing her sister.

Agnes is so affected by what she saw through the mind meld that she murders the person she loves most in this world and then later in the series gambles that the synthetics will do the right thing and not genocide all life in the galaxy and helps to save them instead. I guess you could say her speaking to Soji for five minutes that one time could've helped change her mind, but it still seems strange that a character would do such a distinct 180.

There's hardly a real arc for anyone and what arcs there are make little sense or I just find fairly boring. Soji, a few days after finding out she's an android, wants to bring about armageddon for organic life, but then decides not to because I guess Picard was cool to her. Agnes flip flops like I mentioned before between being horrified enough to murder and then potentially making that murder pointless a few days later. Rios is depressed about the incident with the other synthetics and his captain's suicide and then I guess gets over it? No one else really has a significant arc of any kind that I can remember. Elnor starts off as a comic relief ninja and ends that way. 7 starts off as a now nihilistically mooded fanservice Mary Sue and ends that way. Narissa starts off as the wicked witch of the cube and ends that way(well she ends up supposedly dead, but she'll probably be back in season 2 considering we don't see her die as far as I remember). I guess Picard learned to express himself more?

I understand full well why people here really want to like this show. I very much wanted to as well and really did try up until a little past halfway through and while there are technical aspects to like(minus the stock footage), I don't see how anyone can really claim that the creators of this series had a firm grasp on what people want out of Star Trek or competent storytelling in general. Now I expect very much to get flamed here because I know people here did genuinely enjoy this first season and are getting really tired of people like me, and so I just ask that you tell me what it is that you enjoyed about it if you're in that camp. It might be that in a few years I look back and think I was too harsh on the show. It happened recently with me with Enterprise and hopefully it will happen here too, but at least right now I'm really cold on this series.",Thoughts on Star Trek: Picard's character development

1,"I've always had the head canon that Picard switched to his grey jumper with the red captain's coat to (aside from make him look hella fresh) help a captain assimilate as it were with the general population of the crew within his down time, in an attempt by Starfleet to reduce the personal barriers that would exist between the crew and the authority figure of the Captain so as to make it easier for the Captain to create a more informal relationship with his crew, when the coat is off that is. But when it comes to the other changes I've always wondered why they make them. It could be something as simple as some Starfleet officer designing a new uniform that people like, but is there a reason beyond that? For example they've always maintained the use of primary colours to denote the three types of crewmen but for some reason they decided at some point that red was more befitting of command than yellow. Is there any canon reasoning for this",Are there canon reasons for the evolution of the uniform or is it just generally accepted as the evolution of 'fashion' over time?

I enjoyed this episode! It gave us more good development, an intriguing storyline and some philosophy. Let’s dig in. 

Kosinski keeps saying he’s got everything approved from star fleet commmand. Is there no way for the Enterprise to verify that? Who does the Enterprise get their orders from?

Last episode we Geordi so excited to go Warp 9, which made me think it was the fastest the ship could go. Turns out it wasn’t. They broke the all-time speed record by going “over warp 10”. It feels nice to witness some Star Trek history. 

There was some interesting philosophical discussions about time, space, and thought all being the same thing. It’s an interesting concept that I can’t say I’ve thought of before. Only issue is space is tangible. We’ve been there. It’s unlike the other two in that way. Not sure where I’m going with that, but there’s a discussion in there somewhere. 

We got shown more of Yar’s rape gang backstory. Apparently she stopped for a cat while running from one of those gangs? I mean, okay? On the flip side there was a nice moment with Picard and his mom. It seemed like they had a good relationship. 

There was certainly an urge at first to explore but I thought Picard shut it down perfectly and logically. The interaction was something along the lines of: “So many opportunities for new studies!” “But who would we report our findings to?”

I really liked how they handled Wesley’s promotion. Having the alien tell Picard he really is a savant but that he needs time to learn is a solid way to justify promoting such a young kid. So now we have Wesley, Acting Ensign, who has an opportunity to become permanent, which is cool. 

Felt like the overall theme of the episode was that when we all work together towards a common goal we can break records. We can accomplish great things as a team. Picard got everyone on the ship to focus on The Traveler and getting them home and because of that they were able to return.",Star Trek TNG S1E5 Discussion

On the other hand, Janeway has some good points about why they shouldn't assist the Cooperative in their plans. Firstly, assisting ex-Borg to form their own collective is just hinky. There is no indication that the other stranded ex-Borg on the planet even wanted to collectivize. Then again, if they don't, they all seem hellbent on destroying one another. Janeway's point about the restarted Borg cube possibly summoning other Borg cubes is a good point; one can only hope the Cooperative was able to block the Borg on it from signalling the other Borg. I mean, we have no proof they can do that, but maybe? Otherwise, all they would've accomplished was to bring the Borg right back to them, so I suppose they had thought of that and had a way to stop those Borg.

Also, exploding the Borg cube is basically murder, especially as we know those drones could be disconnected from the collective and reestablish their own identities, just like the colonists on the planet. However, it's arguably necessary to destroy them to prevent them from assimilating and/or destroying Voyager and the colonists.

It would be interesting to see what became of this Cooperative. If they make it to a second generation (and I don't see why not; there's an episode where the Doctor notes Seven is still fertile, implying the Borg don't sterilize their drones) their children won't have the implants necessary for the link. Will they still maintain their idyllic little hippie oneness colony? 

Out of the aliens in the episode, aside from Orum (Romulan) and Frazier (human), one of the Cooperative has facial ridges just like Archer's great-granddaughter in that ""E2"" episode. Is she Ikaaran? One of the attackers seems to be a Nausicaan. The others may be exotic Delta Quadrant species I'm unfamiliar with.","VOY: ""Unity"""
1,"For starters I’ll just say this might become quite a long post, and I know the new films are incredibly divisive, but that just means you get a better debate and comparing of ideas out of them so I’m looking forward to the comments on this and what thoughts people have on them.

Anyway, Picard has got me in a very Trek-y mood lately so I’ve been watching all the movies, most are re-watches but a couple for the first time. Naturally I ended up at what I’ll call the Kelvin films. I was born in 98 so these are the only Trek movies I was able to watch at the cinema, but I’m a big Trek fan and have been for as long as I can remember. 

I’m just going to say now I really like Star Trek 09 and Star Trek Beyond. Trek 09 was a really clever way to re-tell the story of the original crew of the Enterprise and the way it doesn’t obliterate the entire cannon by just starting again was a good choice on its part. (I know it does start most things over again but it’s an alternate realty so you get my point) And as for Beyond, I think I can honestly say it’s tied with First Contact for my favourite Trek movie. You can feel the love Simon Pegg has for it in his script and it just feels the most like Star Trek out of the new batch. It’s one of what I call my ‘happy films’. I just bloody love it. 

But man, Into Darkness...exists, I guess.

The 09 movie went so far out of its way to separate itself from Trek stories that had already been told just for them to come back to Khan. I guess at the very least we have something to point to as the moment JJ Abrams started remaking old movies instead of thinking up new ideas, because he did exactly the same with the Star Wars sequels. I know Khan is probably Trek’s most well known villain, but he’s by far the weakest part of this film. 

I’ll give the movie this, the morally grey stuff between Kirk, Marcus and Khan is good. I really enjoy a bit of throwing morally grey stuff into things, it just makes them a lot more interesting. But the rest of the film is average at best and it’s the only one of the new batch that I tend to agree with people who have more negative views of them. It’s such a lazy retelling and all of the tension between Khan and Kirk is lost because they don’t have that shared history they did in the original version. In this Kirk is more of a minor inconvenience to Khan than his sworn enemy, and that really takes away from the film.

Also I’d like to know how someone who was around before the timeline diverged went from hispanic to the most English guy to ever exist. I know Benedict Cumberbatch was, and still is, a huge name, but if prime timeline Klingon ships are shown in the Kobyashi Maru test in Trek 09 surely Khan can keep his race/ethnicity in this?

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the Kelvin films, nothing new but I have Reddit now some at least I can write them down. I know they’re not everyone’s cup of Earl Grey tea, but for the 2/3 majority I for one really enjoy them, especially Beyond. But yeah...Into Darkness...really not the best",Just some thoughts on the Kelvin movies
1,"Star Trek TNG S1E4 Discussion 

Geordi was so excited about hitting warp 9. What a letdown. Is that the fastest a ship can go? 

I feel like data could have figured that finger trip out. Seemed weird to me but they kept running with that gag. 

All right Worf is getting involved! I know he’s a Klingon and is a warrior but that’s about it. Loved to see him stand up for Riker. Hopefully he can have some bigger roles in upcoming episodes. 

The Enterprise crew has been coming across as so weak. Bowing to the orders or two different leaders in a row. Then Riker, Geordi, and Data all get smoked once they land on the planet. They sort of addressed it at the end when discussing with the empire leader about their philosophy. 

The Ferengi were 200 years behind us in culture but their weapons are stronger than ours? Also more sexist aliens when it comes to Yar. Again already?

Also is that Star Wars reference intentional? A thing called the force appears and immediately makes a Palpatine face and is head of an empire lol are we allowed to mention Star Wars here?

1,"So after binging through TNG, VOY and DS9 for the very first time and I just finished ""What You Leave Behind"". I know stuff like this get's posted **a lot** and no one really cares about my opinion, but I wanted to share my thoughts anyway.

Firstly I think I have to say I'm not a big Star Trek nerd. I watched the old (Kirk) movies as a kid and really liked them but that's about it. I've seen the 2009 film and thought it was okay, same with Into Darkness (haven't seen Beyond yet), but I didn't really had any interest in watching the ST series, until I started watching Discovery when the second season came out in germany (and I'm sorry but I love it). When the first trailer for Picard came out I finally deccided to give TNG on Netflix a try but it took me about half a year or so to get through the first two seasons before I started binging the rest of TNG (including movies), VOY and then DS9.
I think every series had many highs and sadly also many lows (weird sex with a ghost comes to mind) and a lot of stuff that was kinda cool but nothing special either, but in the end I really liked all three of them. I want to make clear, this is not a *hate* post and I truly enjoyed watching DS9 for the most part (in some episodes it's better then anything TNG and VOY ever put out).

But let's get to the point... I know this is a very unpoular opinion but I did not enjoy ""What You Leave Behind"" almost at all. I heard a lot about this being the best final episode of all the series, but I must admit I don't feel the same.

Firstly I hated how the dominion war just ended like that with part one and the second part just focused on the prophet and the Pah-wraith stuff... And with that I also have to admit I was not a fan of this stuff from the very beginning and I didn't really enjoy most of the episodes centering around this religious stuff (like when the prophets just made the Dominion reinforcments disappear like the biggest dues ex machina). I sometime felt like watching Supernatural in space with the prophets beeing the angels and the pah-wraiths beeing the demons (even till the point of them possessing people and the red eys). And what about Sisko? Is he dead? Is he a prophet now who lives in the wormhole? I thought that was not just a little bit weird. Imo this all felt very fantasy and not very sci-fi at all (even tho I **LOVE** fantasy even more then sci-fi). I don't mind a little weirdnes in sci-fi and Star Trek always had this (Q is the fucking best) but I never thought that that kinda stuff should be one of the main themes of a series.

And then you have the epilog with these super cheesy flashbacks... This maybe worked better back when it aired, especially if you didn't just watched all seven seasons in about a month, but I kinda just rolled my eyes at this. The simple moment, when Picard joined the rest of the crew at poker, had me in tears, but this just didn't really click with me at all. (I know the reasoning behind it and can't put blame on anyone, but with Jadzia beeing left out of the memorys this all just felt kinda wrong, especially with Worfs flashbacks) 

Don't get me wrong, I would prefer the flashbacks over the strange sudden ending of Voyager any time, but I don't really get the praise this finally gets.

Now please tell me why I'm wrong, while I start watching Picard. I'm one of those people who absolutly loved Star Wars the Last Jedi and I also love DIS, think section 31 is nice concept and don't really like some of the utopian stuff about the Federation, so maybe I just have strange taste.

tl;dr: I did not like the DS9 finale",Finally finished DS9 [SPOILERS]

This might be a weird thing to take away from Trek, and an even weirder thing to talk about here, but with my recent watch through of all of the Trek series on netflix I've found a sense of acceptance in my identity.  
 I've identified as an Asexual (and ~~probably~~ Bi-romantic) for a bit, but watching Trek has just made me feel more comfortable with that part of myself myself.  
   
All of the characters are valuable to Starfleet without considering their sexuality, Data for instance is as close to a confirmed Ace as we get, and my personal favorite because of his relate-ability to me... even though I have to ignore the whole ""fully functioning"" thing in The Naked Now.    
Then there's Spock, who debatably also expresses some asexual leanings.   
lastly Jadzia being an example of a Pan-sexual, (Confirmed by Terry Farrell herself!) female presenting, gender fluid person makes me unbelievably happy! There are moments that it comes through, but I honestly see them as funny rather than anything which pulls me out of the show like they would in others. I think of the Ferengi Oo-Mox ritual as a good example, that's just hilarious to me whenever it happens because it kinda mirrors how alienated I feel from sex stuff.   
Enterprise is a little less enjoyable for me because of the overt sexuality, but I still find joy within the platonic relationships in the show (especially Malcolm and Trip,) and I can't forget Porthos because doggo!",I'm finding comfort in my (a)sexuality through Star Trek

But I am currently watching season 5 episode 10 and I haven't seen a story that has a lasting impact on the DS9 universe. I mean in TNG, how borg transformed Picard, and it created a whole season of changed characters. But in DS9, even after Chief goes into mind prison or and Commander almost gives up his son for religious visions, in the next episode, everything is back to normal. I mean at least keep it for 2-3 episodes because the causes feel less significant.

Many people don't like the Bajoran politic episodes, and this isn't one of DS9's best but I have a soft spot for episodes like this.  Louise Fletcher as Kai Winn is so wonderful and as I was watching I was thinking about how much she brought to the show.

One loose end I was wondering about was Kubus. The episode didn't resolve whether he was able to go to Bajor after all. Winn no longer had use for him after becoming Kai so maybe she withdrew her offer of sanctuary. On the other hand, Kira learning about what Opaka did - what she felt she *had* to do - could have given her a different view on collaborators like Kubus similar to how she changed her feelings in Duet.  Still, I don't think Kubus ended up on Bajor. What do you think happened?",DS9 - The Collaborator
1,"After seeing “The Inner Light” I’ve found that many consider it one of the best episodes ever. Fortunately for me, I had no idea about that and got to enjoy the episode with no inkling what I had in store. Picard having to experience an entire, full life, and realize everyone he grew to know and love in that life had been gone for many years, and he is now the only remnants of an entire civilization really had an impact on me.

A few episodes later, I watched “Relics” right before going to bed. Again, no idea what I was about to see. When Scotty showed up, I thought it would be a nice episode for nostalgia as I absolutely love TOS, watched it repeatedly as a kid, and only recently even gave TNG a chance (I’m so glad I did).  But showing Scotty grasp with the ideas that he was no longer the expert of the Enterprise, that all he knew and cared about were gone, and at the end of the day was no longer useful and quite honestly in the way struck a different nerve with me. Without too many details I am reaching the end of my own military career, and while not nearly as outcast as Mr. Scott, technology is definitely making me feel like a dinosaur.

Those episodes were a lot to take in on one day (among the others in between those). I’m so grateful I didn’t know what was coming and still don’t for the rest of the series. Few shows actually make me emotional, but TNG sure has.  I care very much about this ship and crew and I’m so thankful for it.

1,"The two most likely games would be either a strategy game like “Birth of the Federation” or for a more modern equivalent, “Stellaris” 

Or.....

A L.A noire type game, with you going around solving problems, and having an overarching plot in the background. 

However, a lot of the old games have fallen into obscurity. Conquest was interesting but it has some major lacking and came out around the end of the lifespan of the PS2 and the Wii. Legacy, while I think it’s good, could have been better and was disappointing for the 30th anniversary(in my opinion). You had Birth of the Federation, but it only had the Next Gen era, but otherwise was good, just kinda overshadowed by other games. We recently had Bridge crew, but that fell into obscurity, and I haven’t heard anything about it in a while. Stage 9 was shut down by cbs. And then we have STO. I would say, it’s a decent game. However, I don’t feel like it is the game should be the pinnacle of Star Trek games. It is a MMO rpg, mostly focused on action and any character choices are mute. Most of the game’s content is locked behind Zen, which is just a paywall. While you can access the story and have fun, it doesn’t feel rewarding after you get to level 40, and if you don’t want to pay money, you can grind for days to get dilithium that will then convert into a negligible amount of Zen.

1,"So we know that Discovery is moving beyond anything we've seen before and that the Federation is a shadow of its former self.

Earth (obviously)
Trill - we've seen them in ads, they're very close in values to humans
Bajor - a federation officer was their religious icon

Tellarites
Vulcans (the proposed Star Trek: Federations which had a very similar premise had them having left to reunify with Romulans)

Should she watch it just as is?

Were these just not made so they could cram in another 30 secs of ads or was this just not done for the DVDs so someone could piss me off.

1,"DS9 had the best pilot of any Star Trek series except 'The Cage.'  It was intelligent, well written, had it's share of action and the acting was fantastic.

Voyager certainly did in it's pilot but not nearly as well.  TNG did it with Q but again, not as intelligently.  Q was a great character but he was a foil for Picard played mostly for comedy relief.

'The Cage' gets best episode because it's intelligence was so far ahead of it's time.  It's aliens didn't mask themselves as human, but manipulated humans with their artifice.  Showing this kind of writing (which I consider Sci-Fi at it's best) rather than simply shoot 'em up plots (Broken Bow comes to mind) puts it firmly at top of the list.

1,The situation on AR 558 annoys me.  The defiant is sent to resupply their people there.  Who apparently are on the brink of insanity because of the war.  But what really bothers me is how poorly defended their settlement was.  Their technology is superior in a lot of ways compared to the dominion.  Why didn't they set up holo emitters to create holographic soldiers to defend the area.  The dominion is smart enough to use holograms.  When the jem'hadar showed up why did they not set their phasers to wide beam.  Why didn't they use drones and artificial satellites in orbit to observe the jem'hadar.  Instead of sending people on a suicide mission.  So AR-558 is just another example of starfleet getting people killed because of incompetence.  They had the resources and the technology to hold back the jem'hadar and keep casualties to a minimum.  But they didn't use them.  I find this very annoying.

Overall, I thought this was a pretty weak episode. Lutan was so obviously a bad guy and the Star Fleet crew just came across as weak the whole time. My commentary below. 

So their first mistake was letting Yar go to the matrix room alone. Like yeah they all agreed she could go but I don’t remember them saying it had to be only her. And oh look, she got taken. Surprise. 

Weird that Wesley got a spot on the deck. Riker called it temporary, but we’ll see. Wanted him to earn it longer. 

Wow this fight to the death is straight out of Black Panther. I’m assuming the comics are older? Not sure. 

Oh and the fight is professional tag to the death. Gotta be some inspiration there. Lol

I was really intrigued by Picard’s rant about what happened to Earth! But then he cut it off in a nod to old fans saying “everyone knows that story”. Will I learn this story from the show or should I look up other source material??

Also Geordi trying to run out of the room because he’s heard 661 of Data’s jokes and can’t take another was fantastic. 😂",Star Trek TNG S1E3 Discussion
1,"Bit of a rant here (who am I kidding - it's a lot of a rant), but I just finished the show and, while it was entertaining, I would even call it good - I have to say - it just doesn't feel like Star Trek. At all. And I don't mean the constant action and brawls every episode - though of course, those contribute - but it's like Picard just forgot what Star Trek was about.

From the get go, we have a Federation that just... sucks. The Federation has been victim to sabotage by the Romulans, sure - but nonetheless, it's a broken, racist Federation, nothing like the one we know. Picard is a bitter old man living a quiet life in a shell of the Federation he once knew.

And sure, we had Deep Space 9, often considered the best Trek, making the Federation 'dark', and exposing corruption within the system, but no matter how dark DS9 got, it had a shining, very moralized crew to show the audience that there was still hope for good, no matter how broken the system was. Picard... doesn't have that. Picard has a bunch of bitter, broken people struggling within a demoralized Federation.

And besides that, Star Trek was always a very transhumanist show - from that episode back in TOS about transcended beings, to Wesley's ascension in TNG (yes, I know, we all hated it), Star Trek was always about going boldly forward - even Q was afraid of what humanity might become in the future, and that's saying something.

So the ending of Picard especially just felt... disappointing. Why does Data need to die to truly experience life? Why is Picard going to squander the opportunity of a \*new body\* on living out as a dying old man? Instead of the transhumanism that Star Trek has \*always\* purveyed, we've been given a fairy tale moral about how life wouldn't be valuable with death. It feels hollow and nonsensical. If you want to die, then die - but there's really no reason to live out your last few days in an increasingly decrepit body for that sake.

On top of that, the synthetic life versus organic life motif seemed a little bit... uninspired. First of all, is anyone getting Mass Effect vibes? And second of all, in an, again, transhumanist show, the implication that synthetic life is completely different and superior to organic life, and that there's no way for the two to work together (or, god forbid, exist as one) seems to lack vision to me. We've seen the 'AI will evolve and destroy all life' plot a hundred times before and it's not quite as compelling in a show about going forward - Picard himself says that fear is no way to live.",[Picard Spoilers] Does anyone else feel like Picard just... forgot to be Star Trek?
1,I've been binge watching enterprise.  They really were unprepared for the dangers of deep space.  They launched without all of their defenses.  They don't have a tractor beam or shields.  If it doesn't have shields they could at least use ablative armor but they didn't even do that.  And I'm not sure about the reliability of their transporter.  Especially since it caused hallucinations in one episode.  This is not the kind of ship a sane person would want to take into deep space.  Let alone go looking for hostile aliens.  This is the starship equivalent of those old world war two fighters that were made out of wood.  You would almost have to have a death wish to want to serve on this ship.  So they obviously had no idea what was out there.  If it wasn't for plot armor this ship would probably have been in tiny pieces long before the end of the first season.  Oh and it's really slow.  Twenty fourth century ships are almost twenty times faster.  So it would have taken them months to travel more then a few dozen light years.  Which means that outrunning hostile aliens wouldn't be an option.  Especially since many of them had ships capable of warp seven.  So the NX class is a death trap.  Anyone serving on one might want to put their affairs in order before hand.  It's probably the most rickety ship in star trek.  So let me know what you think.,Enterprise was unprepared for deep space

1,"I don’t know how many people have paid attention or who are common on the subreddit so who would know I make semi constant posts every so often the last few months and that I’m pretty brand new to the universe. I don’t want to keep pointing that out but I know it’s necessary to give context for what I’m feeling and trying to say or get others feelings on. I’ve only completed TNG and maybe midway through season 2 of DS9 in the main timeline series.

Now with that context out of the way I’ve watched both Picard and Discovery on CBS and honestly I haven’t had much problems with them. Starfleet is sad and depressed in Picard but that made more or less sense in the context of the show and I didn’t mind. The characters in it are also still really well done. So I’m more positive on Picard as additional context. Then I just finished up Discovery and I honestly don’t see any problems with it. It’s going back to true space exploration and space stuff that I’m not getting in DS9 and Picard took awhile to get to and even then wasn’t interesting, in space. 

One of my former coworkers is a Trek fan and hates Discovery because of the politics of the show and that it’s not true Star Trek. With previous context I can’t say one way or another if it is or isn’t but I never got the feeling it was dishonest. I haven’t yet seen a Starfleet during real wartime so the section 31 stuff made sense, even though I do agree that maybe they went too far or shouldn’t have had as much power after the war. And the season 2 baddie being an AI that all of Starfleet uses for strategic analyses is literally the worst idea ever. 

The Discovery itself is such a badass looking ship with a really intriguing special thing about it, the spore drive. It looks so sleek and dare I say sexy AF. Enterprise D ain’t got nothing on it. E is close though. Sorry TOS Enterprise but a little to simple for me lol. The spore drive in and of itself is something so brand new and amazing that I can see why Starfleet would want to look into it. Being able to just drop in and out of anywhere whenever is such a huge strategic advantage it makes sense. And that scene where it’s just jumping all over the damn place around a Klingon ship, I think the ship of the dead(?), was so outstanding and something I had wanted to see I loved it so much. 

Just saw the season 3 trailer and honestly it didn’t grab me at all. But I just want to know what the general opinion is of Discovery, not Picard that was just for added context, and why it seems to be mostly negative. I will say I’m more excited to get back into TOS, barely in season 1 so hardly worth mentioning, because the sound and ship designs, while obviously futuristic, still sounded the same and from the times we saw the Enterprise could see the similarities between this generation and back in the 60s. 

Total side note not at all connected to the main points of this but my god is DS9 honestly really boring and slow. Again only season 2 so I know it gets better later but god is it taking forever I just want to skip ahead but I can’t because that’s not appropriate and I’m a completionist.",Just general feelings on Discovery from anyone else
1,"This is something that always bugs me. Isn't there any culture on the Star Trek universe that is against beaming technology? I know that I wouldn't want to be beamed up anywhere, because the way I see it, teleport is just a fancy way of saying that someone was killed and a copy of them was made in another place.

I'm fine with many cultures accepting being beamed all the time, but even IRL I don't think there's any technology that everyone agrees it is ok. Some people are against blood transfusion, some people were against having their picture taken. And I imagine the First Directive would forbid the Starfleet beaming someone who opposed it on a cultural level.

So, did this subject ever came up on any Star Trek episode? I still haven't watched everything, so I wouldn't know.",Are there any culture against beaming technology?
1,"When I first watched the original series, I did so because I wanted view the franchise from the very beginning and while I enjoyed it immensely (It still has my all time favourite episode), I was always waiting to get to TNG.

It being the sixties I could understand why the characters never seemed to be that emotional and their attachment to each other always seemed so formal. (Except for Bones and Spock, of course).
I figured it was because back then, “men didn’t show emotion” and while there is definitely hints of that, I found myself disappointed that TNG seemed to be even more militaristic then in TOS. Everything seemed so formal and even the friendships took a back seat to politics and formalities. 

Now I’m not saying I hated TNG, in fact I’m going to do a rewatch after TOS, but I was disappointed in the direction they took StarFleet and the Federation as a whole. In TOS StarFleet was obviously based on the military, but they allowed for rule breaking and were more concerned about the “spirit of good”, rather then the fine print. 
 
Anyway back to my original point, as I’m rewatching the Original Series I’m becoming more and more aware of the personalities of all the characters, and though it focuses on the big three, as opposed to the more ensemble crew, the characters all seem so personable and deep. I could literally write an entire post about each of them.
 Kirk the StarFleet man through and through, who has to juggle his responsibilities and his ethics to save the crew, and occasionally save the universe.
 Spock constantly struggling to reconcile is two halves and it’s only until he dies, (and gets into the mind of McCoy) he manages to become more balanced. 
 Speaking of McCoy, what a fantastic character! Choosing ethics over orders and shows his true colours as the confidante and guide to Kirk.

As I’m going through I’m seeing a new side to each character and though there are elements that are dated, and certainly wouldn’t fly today, the show makes an incredible character study of three completely different people, who work so well together. Spock the brain, McCoy the heart and Kirk the body. Each different yet working together.

I hope that I get to see more depth when I rewatch TNG. Is there any character traits that aren’t obvious, that I should look out for?",Surprised By The Depth of TOS
1,"Did it have anything to do with visits from Lwaxana Troi?

Maybe not so much directed at her, but mostly for all the sh*t that follows her around, everywhere she goes. Every other time, Riker, Picard, Sisko and Odo, all had shields and defensive capabilities every time she showed up, and every time she did, something always happens.

1,"Most of the time at least in the TNG-VOY era the crew seemed somewhat informal with each other following only basic formalities as the situation called for it. Gene Roddenberry didn't even like to think of Starfleet as a military. 

They were especially informal much of the time on DS9. Yet when Cadet Nog started his training they were super formal with him. Everything was ""yes sir"" ""no sir"" snap to attention, be a rigid soldier. 

That sort of thing makes sense for a modern military where the priority is training men and women to be capable of going into dangerous situations and killing on command. You want to break them down into a rigidly obedient individual. 

But Starfleet's mission is primarily a peaceful one, they're interested in exploration, scientific discovery, charting new planets, that suggests something different than a soldier's mindset. I wouldn't think a soldier would make a terribly good scientist.

Now I'm not saying they shouldn't have combat training. Obviously its part of their function to be able to fight. But it doesn't make sense to give them the full traditional military conditioning. That's just my opinion.",I don't quite understand the militaristic attitude sometimes. Inconsistencies.

1,"Since the fourth reboot film is apparently still in development, I thought I'd suggest something:

**ALL the main characters, from original series to Discovery, should make an appearance!** Yes, the main characters from Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, etc. I feel like a criticism of the reboot is that it feels too much like a action flick series for teens. And I see that, the second film had so many teenage novel fanservice tropes. Like the whole blood transfusion gimmick. If you're going to make a fanservice-y series, make it totally fanservice-y and cheesy! This would not only appeal to new viewers, it'd give a way for the ""purist"" fans to distance the reboot from the actual timeline.

DISCLAIMER: I've only seen Next Generation and the original movies in full. I've seen a bit of the series after that, I've never seen the Original series and maybe that's why I don't hate the reboot like some other people do. But feel free to tell me what you think!",A way to salvage the reboot films.

I think a lot of it is the acting and dialog.

1,"I saw a few Redditors who wanted to prepare before watching Star Trek Picard so I made a (short) list. 

If you want to watch Picard you need background information for the story. This is a very short list but I think it covers most of the series. Its important that you watch these episodes and the movie. If you dont watch them you wont understand everything. (Especially if you are new to Star Trek) 

The Next Generation:

- Measure of a man (About Data and Bruce Maddox) 
- Unification 1 &amp; 2 (About Romulus, not very important but it gives some context) 
- Face of the enemy (About the Tal'Shiar) 
- I, borg (About Hugh) 
- Best of Both Worlds 1 &amp; 2 (About Picards history with the Borg) 
- The Offspring (About Data) 

Movies:

- Star Trek Nemesis (Very important for the story around Data) 

Voyager episodes:

- Scorpion 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg and Seven of Nine) 
- The Raven (About Seven of Nine) 
- Dark Frontier 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg) 
- Imperfection (Icheb) 

This is a very short list. There are probably more episodes which would help. But I think the episodes above are the most important to understand events prior to the Picard series.

1,"Watching this show has given me so much information! I'm watching TNG for the first time on Amazon Prime and regularly pause the episodes to Google search random facts and tidbits of information discussed on the show. Today, in this particular episode, Fermat's Last Theorem was discussed by Picard.  He stated that it was a mathematical equation that had been unsolved for nearly 800 years, and one that he regularly tinkered with because he found it to be ""stimulating"".

Cue the Google searching. I quickly found the link to the Wikipedia article on the equation, and was astonished that the equation had actually been proven in 1995, roughly 6 years after the aformentioned episode originally aired in 1989. I absolutely love finding stuff like this. Not only is this franchise entertaining, but somewhat educational and completely intriguing as well.","Fermat's Last Theorem, discussed in TNG S2E12, ""The Royale"""
1,"I'm about two thirds of the way through my rewatch of Deep Space Nine, and it strikes me how perfectly analogous the show is for today's culture of lockdowns and social distancing. Something that has struck me over the last month is, despite how rapidly our way of living has changed, we have all adjusted and adapted just as quickly to existing in the shadow of this new threat. 

Compare this to Deep Space Nine. Yes, the the threat of the Dominion perpetually hovers on the other side of the wormhole, but Quark still must carry on doing business, dealing with the usual Ferengi politics. Life on the station changes drastically, from Bajoran political upheaval, to hosting a permanent Klingon garrison, but Dax still continues the customs of her people by assessing a potential Trill host. While it can definitely be argued that this quality of the show is partly due to its episodic nature, the writers are not afraid to maintain the consequences of the changes and the upheaval of the status quo. Things don't just 'go back to normal'. Our characters must adapt and, importantly, continue with their daily lives, facing the Marquis or Jem'Hadar when they must, and coping with the fallout. 

On my daily walks it now feels perfectly natural to encounter face masks in, what always felt like, my safe corner of Britain. So do the empty shops and restaurants I pass. So does walking into the road to give others a two metre berth. And, like the characters of DS9 who experience a massive change over the course of 7 seasons, I can return back home and continue with my work and other aspects of my life without experiencing too much dissonance.

It's not that much of a stretch have the Doc just reaching or having only recently gotten back to the Alpha quadrant around the time Disco jumped to, which is about 950 years in the future.

1,"I had been waiting until I had a chunk of time before getting the CBS free trial so I could watch Picard.  I was off this week from work because of COVID-19 stuff, so I thought I should watch it.  I was honesty nervous and not excited to watch it.  I hadn't read too many posts about it because I was afraid of spoilers, but I had read enough negative things to make me not sure I wanted to watch it.

I bit the bullet and watched it last week.  It was honestly a little sad, Patrick Stuart is getting old ad it was almost hard to watch because of that.  I am a HUGE Star Trek fan Jean-Luc has always been my favorite captain.  It's hard to watch actors you love get older, it really is.  It was also the least ""Star Trek"", Star Trek series I've ever seen.  It had the same species, same Federation, same bad guys, and some of the same people but it was very different.  

The plot was confusing and jumped around, the dialog was stiff and hard to understand at times.  I didn't find the plot engaging enough to fully pay attention too, I found myself easily distracted and didn't care enough about the show to rewind.  

What I did like was the reunion of the familiar characters.  It was fun to see Picard catch up with old crew members.  It was nice to see the familiar species Borg, Romulans, and androids.  

The season was only 10 episodes long and it all came together rather conveniently.  I am disappointed because they could have done so much more!  They had the time, money, and resources to make a really wonderful show and the kind of blew it.  They were never going to do justice to TNG but they could have done more than what they did.  

If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's still Star Trek and it's still Jean-Luc.  If there is a season 2 I hope they do a better job.  I may go back and watch season 1 again in a few months, maybe now that I know the plot and where it's going I'll like it better.",Picard---Spoiler Free

1,"There was a post here about how Spock (and Vulcans in general) can be seen as autistic, or at least based upon an autistic person, that I can’t seem to find now.
Anyway, there I discussed how there was another race that to me, always seemed to be an analogy of autism, and I thought I’d make a full post about it here.
 To start I should say that I am on the spectrum myself so that this discussion will be more from that perspective than that of, say a psychologist. 

Anyway, it seems to me that the Liberated Borg are the most autistic people in the universe. I realise that they are not a species, rather a group of races freed from a terrible hive-mind but that rather helps my case I believe.

So to start, unlike the Vulcans whose society is dedicated to the concept of hiding ones emotions, the Liberated Borg are from many different cultures that view things completely differently. Similar to how someone on the spectrum can be born anywhere and to any culture. They don’t fit in with what their culture asks of them. 

•They have emotions but don’t know how to deal with them. 
•They struggle with many of the concepts of socialisation and have to be taught how to interact with people. 
 •They seem like outsiders to everyone else because they don’t know how to fit in.
•They don’t always know the right way to go about getting something they want and can come across as rude without meaning to.
•They find it difficult to make friends, not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t know how to, as such they tend to come together in solidarity.
•They like to be punctual and efficient and dislike when things go wrong, (like being late)
•They can become obsessed by things that make them forget about other aspects of their lives.
•They like things done their way, without considering how others might feel. 
•They struggle with sensory overload, but it’s inverted. Instead of being too loud (just an example) its being too quiet.
•They can have incredible knowledge in one field they find interesting, while not knowing a thing about something seemingly obvious.
•Most importantly of all though. They are all unique and these features don’t define them. They struggle but they learn. What might seem like a disadvantage, can lead to advantages elsewhere. They all have their talents, and eventually form very close bonds built with understanding and loyalty. 

Obviously these traits are down to the story and their past traumas, but like most species in Trek, they represent an aspect of humanity. I believe it to be autism.",Autism in Star Trek

1,"Hello,

I’m just wondering if anyone can tell me about a model that was released. I’ve looked online and can’t find any information.

When I was a kid, I used to go to a sci-fi/comic shop, where they had a very large model of the Enterprise-D, this was when the show was still on the air, or maybe it had just finished a year or two prior.

I’d estimate it was 4ft, maybe 6ft but probably not. It certaintly took up an entire display window. What I mean is, it may have been moulded from the original filming models.

I saw the same model years later (around 2015) in a forbidden planet in Bristol, so it wasn’t custom made. However the staff had no idea about the history.

I’d just love to know more about it.",Large Enterprise Model?
1,"It seems to me that in every thread about Picard, comments originate from one of two camps: people who really appreciate the ride the show is taking us on, and people who have trouble enjoying the show because of its inconsistencies with both itself and with Star Trek past. And much like America's two political parties at the moment, debates between the two seem to be filled with resentment of one another. My solution to bridging this gap within this subreddit? Everyone should listen/watch BOTH the Greatest Discovery podcast and the re:Views posted on YouTube by RedLetterMedia.


If you're of the type wondering whether other fans must be watching with their brains turned off because of the show's seeming ignorance of canon or history (or sometimes logic), I think what you'd gain from listening to Adam and Ben is an understanding of how two people who have just as much fondness for Star Trek could enjoy Picard. I think you'd see that Adam and Ben are bright guys who are as big a Star Trek nerds as anyone else, they clearly do not watch with their brains turned off, and just engage with the show differently. Plus they're really funny.


If you're of the type wondering why other fans seem so nitpicky and frustrated with the show, I think what'd you gain from watching Mike and Rich is seeing how: 1) the issues they have with the show are very reasonable and often undeniable and 2) their criticism is borne out of a desire for high quality and a concern for how much care is given to a franchise they have deep affection for. They're far from sticks in the mud who sit around pining for old Trek and who hate anything new.


The two shows obviously aren't in dialogue and they won't reconcile the issues or viewpoints that the other one brings up, but I think digesting both of them helps produce a balanced view of the show and of modern Trek. Listening/watching them humanizes different perspectives and I think will lead to richer, more nuanced discussions among fans. I think you'll find them both worthwhile if you haven't already checked them out.",Greatest Discovery vs. Red Letter Media on ST: Picard
1,"I just finished Unification in my TNG watch through and at the end of Part 2 Data beems down to Romulus as his normal android self. He then talked to the common people supporting reunification, the senitor who is Spock's friend. In the same scene Several Romulan guards and Sela surround Data and Picard and Sela sais something along the lines of ""So this is the android I've grown to respect in combat"", addressing Data as an android in front of everybody. There is then few lines exchanged fairly calmly and they are taken prisoner. Durring that time only Spock and Picard are questioned and Data is unnecessary to the Romulans. 

Given what we now know about the Zhat Vash, and more importantly the general Romulan fear of synthetics, this seems rather strange. I get that a this point Data is one of 2 sentient androids and nobody knows how to make more, so he isn't an immanent threat. And might end up being useful as a Starfleet Officer so they don't kill him immediately. But it doesn't seem possible he could stand in front of Romulans from all walks of life as an android and nobody really seems to care. There isn't any unease or tension of any kind between the people in that scene. In the last episode of Picard Narak tells the Romulan myth of the original twins and he seems to expect the random Federation citizens he's talking to be at least a little familiar with it, which suggests every Romulan knows the story.

Obviously this is a ""The Zhat Vash and synth fear didn't exsist in the 80's so they writers didn't know"" situation. But does anybody have an in-universe explanation for why all the Romulans are chill with the destroyer of worlds secretly hanging out on Romulus?",Unification and the Zhat Vash
1,"Why do we want to make synthetic people out of organic material?  I let it go with the BSG reboot but now that more shows are trying to do it I must ask...how is this an advancement?  

Data was a great android.  He had human form and all the speed and agility and utility of a humanoid.  But he was stronger than an organic and much more durable.  Like if a disruptor rifle blew up in his face he would just fly to pieces and then could be put back together.  

second question...why would these fleshy androids be stronger than normal people with fleshy muscles?  It doesn't seem like they should have super strength.

third question...how is a synthetic organic person different from a tailor made genetically engineered person like say Khan?",fleshy androids...why?
1,"We know in the Kelvin timeline, Starfleet is more advanced than the main universe's equivalent century. In fact, I read somewhere that in many aspects the Kelvin timeline was closer to 25th century technology in the main universe. We also saw how large and impressive a Constitution class ship was in this timeline. It is visibly larger than the Enterprise-D, possibly even E, and quite a bit more advanced than Kirk's main timeline ship. 

So if a 23rd century ship looked like that, how big would the Kevin equivalent of a Galaxy class ship be? I imagine a Kelvin Enterprise D would probably wipe the floor with a main timeline Borg cube.",Something I always wondered about the Kelvin universe.
1,"I came across a personal mini epiphany just now. While I liked the first season of Picard, the entire synth story should have been completely scrapped.

The main thread should have been the Borg Reclamation Project. There could have been diplomatic controversies surrounding it, allowing some old school Picard diplomat content.

There could have still been the Zhat Vash, but they could have been targeting the Project for the same reasons they had about the synthetics.

With those two concepts being the thrust of the show, that would allow so much more time to cover the relationships of the characters.

With the pacing of the show and the need to piss off to do the synth stuff, everything was rushed. I can go more into detail with this, but the more I think of the season, the more I cannot understand the creative decisions that were made for this show.",How Picard should have gone

1,"I have always felt like the original Enterprise design (wellll, not so much the original, but the refit/1701-A design) was very elegant and non-threatening and perfectly fit the aesthetic of Starfleet's ethos. But every major cruiser ship design that has come since (except one) has elongated and flattened the design in ways that feel either cumbersome or more aggressive, and I haven't much cared for them. I was only, like, 8 or 9 when TNG debuted, but I remember feeling disappointed with the design of the Enterprise D's Galaxy Class and thinking that it looked rather like a lumbering whale. I was excited when I saw that the Enterprise C's Ambassador Class had a much more Classic Trek design, but then bummed because I knew we were never going to see it again except in brief guest appearances. I was bummed again when I saw that the Enterprise B was an Excelsior Class ship (another design I feel unnecessarily elongated and flattened the classic design) and then lost interest in Starfleet ship design entirely when the Sovereign Class made its appearance. 

I don't understand the desire to keep flattening and elongating the classic design. I know that certain in-universe justifications have been provided, but I'm curious what the behind the scenes rationale and design philosophy behind this trend has been, and how other people in the fandom feel about it.",I am not a fan of the 'flattening' of Starfleet ships over time.
1,"I'm looking for an open discussion after watching Picard. I loved the series, don't get me wrong - but I was pretty disappointed for a season that revolved around Data and Hugh, there was no appearance of Geordi.

I've always been under the impression since TNG that Data and Geordi were best friends. Geordi always seemed to be the main go to guy for Data, encouraging him to explore dreams and emotions and Data even said to Lore that Geordi was his friend and that he would hurt Geordi for emotions when he was under Lore's influence. 

That's not to say that Picard didn't have a real profound influence on Data's development towards understanding humanity but they didn't seem to go and casually 'hang out' like Data and Geordi did on a normal friends basis - like Geordi and Data talk about their holodeck adventures.

1,"What shows or movies do you think feel like Star Trek but are not part of Star Trek at all? TBH I'm looking for good things to watch. 

I'll give the two that come to mind (feel free to take these as recommendations)

1. Interstellar: I know, I know, many people hate the ending, I love it but what ya gonna do. But conceptually this feels like Star Trek in a pre-Enterprise sort of way. You have an Earth that's dying from climate change as people are embracing anti-intellectualism and anti-science because they have simply lost hope in humanity's resilience. There's no immediate reason to hope so they just don't.   All changes when a group of human explorers goes into the unknown with a slim hope of saving humanity and expanding to the Stars. It's ultimately a story about how human ingenuity can accomplish anything. That's a very Star Trek message. 
2. Defiance: I recently rewatched this series, I was so pissed off when Syfy canceled it that I haven't given a Syfy show a chance ever since. This series is about a town where different alien species live in peace with each other, or they try at least. The backdrop of the series is a very vicious war between humanity and the aliens that left many cultural wounds between them. It ended when both sides in a battle defied orders, dropped their weapons,  work together to save the human and alien civilians that were caught in the crossfire.  It's very DS9 but set on Earth. The main character is the human sheriff, his alien adoptive daughter. (It also has beautiful cinematography for a Syfy TV show) 
3. BONUS: This is a completely different genre and medium, but if you haven't check out the Sherlock Holmes stories. 8/9 books are on the public domain so you can read them online, they're also short reads, like 100 pages each. There's a reason why there's such a crossover between Sherlock Holmes fans and Star Trek fans, they have similar themes and values but in completely different contexts. 

Anyway, those are my two suggestions. Do you have anything for me?",Star Trek shows/movies not named Star Trek
1,"Hey so I’ve watched TNG and Deep Space Nine and loved them but my friends said that I probably wouldn’t like Voyager based off of the other shows I watch on Netflix and they type of things I like from the other Star Treks.

1,"So I decided to finally take the plunge today and dive into the Star Trek universe. I've not seen anything in the past besides the 3 most recent movies. 

I was curious what people think the best watching order is with the various shows. Obviously I'm starting with the Original Series and will then move onto The Animated Series followed by The Next Generation but should I finish TNG completely before moving onto Deep Space Nine and do the same with that before moving onto Voyager?

Or should I watch the episodes in a certain order and alternate between the shows? Is there any crossover that I may miss if I don't watch them in a certain specific order.

Finally, what about the movies? Should I watch all the Original Series movies before even starting TNG or, again, watch them in between TNG episodes based on when they released?",Star Trek watching order?
1,"Most Americans and global citizens dont want socialism, and want capitalism to stay. But in a time like this, capitalism needs to recognize it needs to check itself and FREEZE itself for several months if it wants to bounce back faster from this. For instance, I owe money for rent, and if I dont pay, landlord MAYBE cant pay the mortgage he owns. As Fox news was thankfully pointing out last night, most of this all goes back to he banks. If we could all just freeze everything, and keep providing services for free, we could bounce back faster. If you had loans and mortgages and utilities, even cable/internet, all that should continue to be supplied at NO cost. We allow the utilities to be corporate owned, and they all fleece us on prices. They could literally afford to go without for a few months. The banks could take a fucking chill pill and go without, but actually, theres an easy fix for them to not lose money. Just freeze all payment requirements for 6 months, and just extended the terms of the loans by 6 months with no extra interest accrued. If the USA and the world could just live like Star Trek (even though we know that fantasy isnt sustainable long term) for a few months, most everyone would come out of this financially as good as they were when we shut the world down, and will all go back to regular spending much faster.

1,"So, as the title indicates, I would like to discuss the drop of article ""the"" when naming starships.

In TOS, the Enterprise was THE Enterprise. Same in TNG. And even now in DIS, it's still ""the Enterprise"". And also in PIC.

But in VOY, except for a couple of times in the beginning, it was always ""Voyager"" and not ""the Voyager"". In ENT it was also ""Enterprise"" and not ""the Enterprise"". And in DIS, it's ""Discovery"" and not ""the Discovery"".

And well, this bothers me a little. I can understand they said Deep Space Nice, and not THE Deep Space Nice, because of the sound of it. But the others? Specially in ENT? And why in DIS they say ""Discovery"" but ""the Enterprise""? I don't get it, I don't see the logic. It's not a big deal, of course, but I have to admit I've never liked it.

What do you think guys? Has this issue ever been addressed before?","Drop of article ""the"" when naming starships"
1,"Spoilers ahead for Picard!

I just binged watched the season and wanted to write down some of my thoughts. I'm new to the Star Trek universe (except the JJ movies), and this was my first Star Trek show. 

And I will say I'm kinda in love with Star Trek now. The show was intriguing and exciting and was a fun ride. The whole universe was so cool (I really want a replicator please) and the overall story kept me on the edge of my seat. 

I really enjoyed all the characters, except for and I will probably get a lot of hate for this, Picard. He did have his moments for sure but I obviously have no prior knowledge or any nostalgic feelings for this guy, so I felt he was too much of a one dimensional, can only do good, character. He seems too black and white. Like he didn't have ANY misgivings about synth life that can literally destroy all organic life as we know it? Like he was a little too hyper optimistic. I know I definitely understood the viewpoint of the Tal Shiar given the vision/past they saw. 

But the moral greyness in a lot of the other characters, the sacrifice and motivations of some characters had to take especially in regards to taking a life to save another, is what really made this show great. Loved Narek (and his pain about loving Soji but needed to destroy her and her kind), Narissa (badass but anyone else get a little incest-y vibes from them early in the season tho?), Agnes (didn't care for her at first), 7 of 9 (also badass and gay. loved that she got revenge on that one chick on Free Cloud), Rios (love the multiple personality ship program thing, really cute) and pretty much the rest. 

However, I did think the ending was a little flat and unbelievable? I didn't have to suspend my disbelief THAT much prior to the finale. I know there was quite a bit of fan service in the show, and it kinda felt like the whole star fleet getting there in the nick of time by his old buddy was shoehorned in. Like this guy who hasn't been in Star Fleet for years just suddenly leads a giant fleet to stop an intergalactic event from happening? Not to mention they had banned synths and all of a sudden they're ok potentially starting a war with the Romulans just to save a handful of life they didn't deem worthy of existing in the first place? 

Plus the Romulans just backing out after they didn't activate the beacon was kinda too clean. The Tal Shiar's main objective their whole organization is dedicated to kill all synthetic life forms and they just back out? Would they not sacrifice themselves to see their main objective complete? And then synth ban is lifted and Picard comes back to life, which obviously they can't make a show with his name without him but it makes his sacrifice almost meaningless.

I think maybe if they hadn't rushed it so much and made the season a bit longer it might have felt more satisfying. However... saying all that, I do prefer a wrapped up season as opposed to cliff hangers. I'm glad the story was all concluded and I do love a happy feel good ending (that crew shot in the end tho!). Even tho the ending was pretty disappointing and a dip in the overall series I still loved the journey getting there and the season overall. And happy that this series exists, might make a trekkie outta me.

Looking forward to exploring more of the Star Trek universe! Gonna hit up Discovery while I still have my CBS subscription.",Star Trek noob. Some thoughts on Picard!
1,"In the opening of Hollow Pursuits, we see Dwight Schultz in ten forward acting like a loose canon in a starfleet uniform. Guinan says where he goes danger follows, and he pushes around Geordi and Riker. The illusion only really starts to break down when Troi is obviously into him after seeing him beat up her friends. 

Now to us, it might be more obvious that this is a guy living out a fantasy (either a dream or holodeck). 

But to audiences at the time, what was Dwight Schultz known for? He'd just finished his run on the A-Team as Howling Mad Murdock. So that makes him more credible as this tough guy that can bully the Enterprise crew. That makes it more believable that the writers might have actually cast him as this reckless violent officer. 

And then we have the reveal, Dwight Schultz is playing completely against type. Barclay is very different from his previous role, it really shows off his range.",Dwight Schultz in Hollow Pursuits was actually a nice bit of stunt casting.

His body is very disgusting. He is like a worm, and while his lips are black, they are not the worms. Like a silkworm, they come out of the hole and spend their time chewing.

1,"Thought/theory is for the Kelvin timeline and why the Enterprise seems huge compared to TOS and main timeline Constitution class ships. Could it be that since a future Romulan “mining” vessel attacked the Kelvin that Starfleet thought about it and were like “hmm. We need a bigger badder flagship than the one we have planned” and in so doing skipped the Constitution class and went straight into Constellation(?) or whichever is the next iteration or the one after that with size and power? 
Idk if it would be Galaxy class but probably by the time the Enterprise D comes to pass in the Kelvin timeline that would be further advanced as well. 
Pure speculation of course, and I think the real world explanation is it needed room for added shuttles and shuttle bays but I like thinking in world better. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of Picard. Now I’m pretty new to the universe of Trek, only finished TNG and in the second season of DS9, so I don’t have nearly the experience or knowledge to really say how it was as a Trek show and I get that. Having said that I’m kinda in the middle. 
On the one hand I loved Picard the character and his utter no nonsense on how Starfleet has disappointed him deeply. I’m on the fence about the world as it is since TNG explicitly stated, and I’m sure DS9 or Voyager also hinted at, that Earth is no longer about monetary gain or individual power and only wants to expand our knowledge and understanding of the universe or just do nothing. But they did I think a fair job in showing that maybe since the attack on Mars and Starfleet backing off that’s why things have gone back to our normal. 
On the other hand I also hate how characters we know and love aren’t around, for long at least, and the ones we do get are either boring or don’t get enough to do. Also starting to get annoyed with prophecies or warnings or in this case both at the same time. 
I do wish that for Picard they had made it more of the exploration of space with a subplot of the Romulan ploy or something like that and especially with the slow opening of the first few episodes that would have been better. 

Now for the season finale and Godamn idk how to feel about it. Gonna be honest I kinda wanted the Romulans and Starfleet to get into a massive battle as that could have been awesome but that’s not Star Trek and I get it. What Picard did was 100% the only way to go about it. 
His mind being transferred was absolutely predicted and foreshadowed and even though I knew they were going there I was hoping they wouldn’t and I would get pissed if they did it. So hoping they would just let him die after saving an entire race of androids and preventing a massive war. I know the show is called Picard but still they could have continued the show in his memory if they wanted. 
I still lost it when he died though. I don’t care if we all knew he was going to live so it shouldn’t matter or whatever but we still literally watched him die. The Picard we knew is dead. This Picard, while maintaining his DNA and memories, isn’t the Picard that died. He even had to make sure they didn’t make him immortal so that alone still confirms it isn’t our Picard. Having said that he’s also gonna be the Picard we still look up to and believe in. 
I’m intrigued to see where season 2 goes, hopefully the return of other beloved characters and some real space exploration stuff, and I’ll see if I care to resubscribe at that point",A random thought/potential theory and feelings on Picard *SPOILERS* sorta
1,"Out of all of the ST shows, Voyager is perhaps the one with the most potential, that was the least developed.

It goes beyond just photontorpedoes and shuttlecraft. After each episode, everything is back to normal and the crew goes back to being just regular Starfleet folks doing their thing.

There’s no sense of these people actually believing or acting like they’re going to be stuck in the Delta Quadrant for decades.


So how would you change the show and makes it live up to its premise?

Here are some of my ideas:

* Janeway starts turning the Voyager into a generational ship. They start growing their own food, plants start lining the corridors to take some of the pressure of the oxygen system.

* As the season begins, we see Starfleet members wearing their usual uniforms, while the Maquis crewmembers wear their clothes, just with combadges. As the season progresses, we see the two styles mix more. Starfleet uniforms appearing more out of regulation and Maquis members wearing parts of Starfleet uniforms.

* Janeway and the senior officers also come to the realization that in worst case scenario they need to start having children. Naturally encouraging people will only go so far, so what to do? Should the computer just pair people up? Artificial insemination? What about people who for some reason don’t want children?

* They decide to introduce holodeck and replicator ration priority to people who sign up for having children, which naturally leads to some grumbling. Will this ultimately lead to Voyager becoming a ship with a privileged class and an underclass? What about polygamous marriages? They’re against Starfleet regulations, but some crewmembers want to try that arrangement. Janeway decides to allow it and go against Starfleet regulations. One of many violations of official regulations to come.

* Janeway uses some Starfleet emergency regulation to declare existing marriages null and void. Janeway and the senior officers decide that they must lead by example, so she expects each of her senior officers to pair up with another. Much to her anguish she also chooses to set a good example, but with who? She knows Tuvac better, but marrying Chakotay might lessen the Maquis-Starfleet tensions that have been brewing.

* The Voyager gets an opportunity to take some years off their journey, but it means they must violate Starfleet directives. Janeway does this, and starts to realize that she might have to break more in the future to ensure the ships safety. Ultimately she decides not to commit an even more egregious violation of their principles. Which leads to...

* Janeways trial. The crew put Janeway on trial. For breaking Starfleet protocol? Or is it because she didn’t do enough to bring them home? The Voyager is in full mutiny, the senior officers are divided. Should they use force? Ultimately Janeway notices something encouraging. The fracture lines aren’t between Maquis and Starfleet crewmembers. Instead some of the Maquis join Starfleet crewmen in wanting to restore order, while some Starfleet crewmen have joined in with former Maquis and demand that they no longer strictly adhere to Starfleet protocol. As a result...

* The Voyager holds elections for the post of Captain and First officer. Janeway, much to her chagrin realizes that the ship that some day will return to the Alpha quadrant may not be a Starfleet vessel but something very different.

Aaaand, that would be my short treatment for the first season or two of Voyager.

What do you think? How would you make the show live up to its full potential?",How would you make Voyager more interesting?
1,"Let's be honest. We say TOS, but the title of the show is not ""Star Trek: the original series"", it is just ""Star Trek"" .

1,"The Star Trek franchise has always had some references to martial arts since the original, but most fighting was still old-fashioned stage combat or Western cowboy stuff. I think Discovery and Picard have way too much martial arts and it seems silly.

I'm a martial arts fan but I think there's too much of that genre crossing into the sci-fi of Trek, which is supposedly based on the possibilities of real science and astrophysics. Elaborate kung fu fighting is a fantasy. Burnham and Georgiou have been at it since the beginning of Discovery, and now in Picard we see Jason Bourne androids, a Romulan anime samurai, and Romulan spies doing spinning jump kicks.

 ended.

 I'd keep almost everything the same - the crew on the planet convince  the androids to close the portal (stupid though the mystery box was)  Riker shows up and convinces the Romulans to leave (lame though the deus  ex machina was), and then Picard's aneurism triggers and he collapses  to the floor. 

The crew beam down to the planet and begin trying  to upload Picard's consciousness to the android-body. Picard's ""soul""  goes to the databank and speaks to Data's ghost and they say their  tearful farewells, Picard agrees to pull the plug and let Data die. 

 Meanwhile, in the real world, disaster - Dr Soong has selfishly  sabotaged the process, transmitting his own consciousness to the  android. ""Picard died a natural death,"" he argues, ""There's no reason he  should get what was meant to be mine!""

7 of 9 shows up and saves  the day; she injects Picard with Borg nanites that can regulate his  neural activity and keep him alive; the crew re-download his  consciousness back to his original body, and everybody is happy (though  obviously Dr Soong is now a pariah). Picard makes it clear he's happier  in his own skin, even if he has a small bit of borg tech back in the  mix, so everyone's relieved. 

They hold a small memorial for Data and pull the plug, just like in the original show. 

 The crew beams up to the ship and warps away, feeling like big damn  heroes. The credits roll. Then we get an after-credits scene...

 Picard wanders the halls of the ship. There's something... different,  something cold about his posture, about his face. He finds 7 of 9,  alone. She smiles. Her eyes flash green-and-back. When she speaks, it is  with the thousand voices of a Collective...

1,"If he were running the country, would we be sending our medical supplies like PPEs and our medical personnel over to, say, Iran to help them to cope with the crisis? Or open our border to Mexico so that their people can seek better medical treatments?

He would make a really inspiring speech to the country and then everything would happily ever after.",What would Picard do - COVID-19?
1,"I'm a huge Star Trek fan. And I've posted an idea similar to this on a different reddit, but I've had the idea to make a game trailer for a Star Trek FPS game that'll never get made. I guess you would classify this as fan content, so we'll be sure to follow star trek fan content guidelines when making this. This is meant to just be a prank, a late april fools joke of sorts. We make a trailer for the game, and at the end say it was all a prank. I think this would just be a creative, cool, funny idea to pass the time. If you want to help, DM me to let me know!

1,"I am an older Star Trek fan. I have loved Star Trek since the mid-seventies when I'd race home from the second grade to watch re-runs after school. I'm an old guy, so sure, that colors my thoughts. 

I refuse to pay for CBS All Access (I wish every consumer would do the same), but been binging Picard on free trial...

OMG! This show is soo fucking stupid. Such a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay for it. 

Let me start off by saying that I appreciate a lot with you Millenials. You are great with I.T., you have a wonderful sense of confidence, but your storytelling... is... just stupid. And that is what Picard seems to me to be, a Millenial version of Star Trek. You got the cliche badasses with vape pens, tattoos, the computer voice that sounds just like Siri, the impossibly badass fight scenes, the Lord of the Rings reject character, the convoluted storyline (because if it's complicated it makes it good right), the Game Of Thrones gore, that ""quirky"" sense of humor, the drinking whiskey out of the bottle, The F-bombs, and on and on. 

The ""badass"" captain guy who is smoking cigars in a spaceship listening to Billie Holiday on... VINYL; just so sickeningly hipster.  Come on. I know Billie Holiday is eternally cool, but can we lay off the cliche a little bit? 

Downvote away. It's fine, but come on people can't we just have a smart Star Trek? I love Star Trek. I just want another good Star Trek show.",My thoughts on Picard: Downvote Fest
1,"Now that I've finished Picard, I am struggling to find a solid Sci-Fi show to watch. 

I've seen all the usual suspects (Babylon 5, Expanse, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, Farscape, SG-1, Dark Matter, Orville, Andromeda, X-Files, Dr. Who, etc...).  

Looking at Netflix or really any other streaming services, very few of the new shows are Sci-Fi.  And the ones that are (Lost in Space season 2) are kind of lackluster and predictable.   

So what gem have I missed?  Doesn't have to be in English as long as there are subtitles.","After Picard, what other Sci-Fi do you folks watch?"
1,"I've seen bits and pieces of Star Trek over the years, but I'd never been a huge Trekkie or anything like that. However, I eventually realized that a good deal of the sci-fi I've read/watched over the years is..kind of bleak and depressing. I love Blade Runner as much as the next person, but you can only read/watch so many cyberpunk/post apocalyptic stories about humanity failing to make any sort of progress in the future without getting kinda depressed. I realized I was craving some optimistic, humanistic sci fi where the future isn't a total shithole, so last December I decided to start watching Star Trek from the beginning. 

On the whole, I liked TOS a lot, especially the first two seasons. Despite the dated special effects and the surprising amount of casual sexism, a lot of it held up really well! My top ten episodes: 

1. **Balance of Terror** - A genuinely thrilling story. The fear and uncertainty surrounding the Romulans' sudden attacks on the Federation's outposts, the mutual respect between Kirk and the Romulan commander, it was all so well done. 

2. **The Enterprise Incident** - One of the few truly great episodes in season 3. I love the Cold War-style conflict between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire, and the budding forbidden romance between Spock and the Romulan commander makes me think of this episode as basically a Spock-centered Balance of Terror. 

3. **Journey to Babel** - The episode that really made me love Spock as a character. 

4. **The Doomsday Machine** - Like Balance of Terror, an episode that's aged very well. 

5. **The Immunity Syndrome** -The Enterprise vs. a giant space amoeba, some self-sacrifice from Spock, and Kirk refusing to allow it. What's not to love? 

6. **The Changeling** - Classic ""talking a computer to death"" stuff. 

7. **Obsession** - An underrated episode with some great character moments for Kirk and Bones. 

8. **The Trouble With Tribbles** - The scene where Kirk is chewing out his crewmen for getting into a bar fight with the Klingons never fails to crack me up. 

9. **The Devil in the Dark** - Another underrated episode. 

10 **The Ultimate Computer** - Fascinating episode about the dangers of AI. 

If you're wondering why I don't have **The City on the Edge of Forever** or **Mirror, Mirror** on my top ten list like everyone else does, it's because I think that those two, while good, are both a little overrated and don't deserve to be counted among the absolute best episodes. 

Now that the positive stuff has been said, I'll give some criticisms. Season 3 was a struggle to get through. The only episodes from this season that I really loved and can see myself rewatching we're The Enterprise Incident, The Tholian Web, and Day of the Dove. The rest of it ranges from mediocre to straight-up-awful (Spock's Brain, Turnabout Intruder). 

I'm also surprised at how underdeveloped Sulu and Uhura are as characters. After three seasons, I couldn't tell you a thing about their personalities, despite them being regulars. That said, I love Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty, and the post-episode banter between the three main characters was some of my favorite parts of the show. 

Anyway, this weekend I'm gonna watch the TOS films from The Motion Picture all the way to The Undiscovered Country, then I'm gonna start on The Next Generation!",Yesterday I finished watching The Original Series for the first time...
1,"Greetings everyone on this fine quarentined day. Over the past couple weeks I have recently found myself exposed to the new trek as well as the criticisms behind them and wanted to share my experiences as well as hear from others on theirs.

To point out though, I am only 18 years old. I have been watching Star Trek since I was two and have watched every series and movie. I do not know everything about Star Trek but I do know I am a major fan. I had initially avoided the New Treks, such as Discovery and the movies, since many negative opinions were floated around online. However, I have finally watched them and come to love them.

To start off, the movies. I had no quarrel with them at all. It was an attempt at starting over. Letting a new universe be built. I loved the fact that a seperate timeline was created just for that. I found it ingenious. However, I have never been the biggest fan of TOS. This new take on the movies gave me a new interest in Captain Kirk as a character and his growth in this new timeline. However, I was more intrigued by the relationship between him and Spock. The strongest bond between a captain and first officer ever seen in Star Trek. (I know many will say Picard and Riker were strong as well, but I saw that more as a Mentor/Ward relationship than a relationship between equals). Overall, I enjoyed the idea of the movies more than the movies themselves. I honestly was wondering if we would ever get a Kelvin Picard.

Next, Picard. Now, when I heard Picard was coming out, I started giggling like a child. My favorite species has always been the Borg. They were the species that caught the most of my attention throughout all of Star Trek. So, when I heard Picard was being made, I knew the Borg would return. In the past, over psychoanalysis of trauma indured by Star Trek characters seemed a bit... brushed by? I think this was because the world of Star Trek was originally assumed to be a sort of Utopia besides the happenings in space. I have heard several comments about how Gene Roddenberry would have never let certain things happen like they have been with New Trek. For instance, The Seven/Picard heart to heart of their trauma as Borg. Anyways, I digress. I watched Picard as each episode came out. I was seeing a lot of hate for it though. Some was understandable I would admit, but I noticed, the less I tried to compare it to continuity, the more I would enjoy it. Picard was the perfect love letter to the character of Data. I loved every second of it. The ending was slightly predictable though, however, thats how it is when you want to make more than one season. Picards characterization seemed a bit scattered at first but seemed to piece itself together near the end. I loved seeing the aftermath of the Romulan Supernova and seeing what the federation has become. Its flaws being unveiled. A common theme in New Trek. I always have enjoyed politics in movies and understanding motives. I guess that is why I liked the Star Wars Prequel triology. I will admit though, it does not take the cake as my favorite Star Trek series.

Finally, Discovery. Oh boy. The awful comments I have heard of this show over the years. I never stepped near it until recently and I must admit, I was surprised and impressed. After watching Picard, I knew Discovery's biggest problem will be keeping to continuity. I knew if I watched it while keeping that in mind, I would find myself miserable. So, I watched it without it in mind and frankly, I loved it. The character depth in the 15 episode first episode made me feel so connected to the characters faster than even my favorite Star Trek: DS9. I loved the politics behind it all. The lore expansion of Sarek and consequently Spock. I loved the fact that the Mirror Universe became a maine plot point. I loved how despite Starfleets imperfections, its morals and values was the main driving force. The action sequences were incredible. The idea of the spore drive, although a bit out of the wrong time frame, is freaking cool. At the time of this post, I am on Season 2 Episode 2. I must say, I have fell in love with Captain Pike so quickly. The wisdom he holds is prominent. The actor who portrays him is excellent. I am so excited for the second season plus whenever the third comes out

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please share your thoughts and opinions! I love having civil discussion.",An Opinion and Discussion on New Trek
1,"I just watched the Voyage Home because the Guardian did an article on it. 

I mean, the writing is a masterclass, no line is wasted, whether it’s an (earned) character moment, a set up to a later scene (or a payoff) or just a nice general piece of witty business.  

The performances, particularly the leads, are note perfect, underplayed, and warmly conveyed with just the right amount of tongue in cheek. Most of it actually plays more seriously than I actually remembered. There’s only one bit of *The Shat*, when he spots George and Gracie on the side of the bus. 

Other than that, it’s a perfect piece of storytelling, with the emphasis on story. 

All too often we see things that are either all plot and no character or all character and no plot. This was a fine example of ST doing both.  It deserves its place as the best performing (as I understand it, when adjusted) and is probably the best recognised (after Khan) with the general public, even if that’s just as “the one with the whales”.  

Bravo Mr Nimoy, bravo Mr Meyer for your script polish.",The Voyage Home is a Masterclass
1,"coming from someone who likes star trek. a lot. 'juvenile' is the best way to put it. this comes through most in the dialogue. clumsily written and inarticulate, like a child trying to express a very deep thought but lacking the language to express it. you read between the lines and say 'i'll give you a pass because i understand what you were *trying* to say.'

i have complicated feelings toward most of the social allegories in star trek. people who criticize these usually say something along the lines of 'old trek had subtlety, new trek beats you over the head with a moral stance'. ok, fine point to make, we could debate the trueness of that statement all day. personally i think old trek was just as hamfisted; we put up with it because everything else was campy in equal measure. but i think it misses the actual issue, that being that almost every allegory it attempts lacks depth. hate in real life is this complicated web of emotion and bias and circumstance. when trek does a direct allegory it usually goes something like 'x aliens don't like y aliens, because they're y'. childish. you know?

i think this is why my least favourite episodes are ones dealing with large-scale interplanetary conflicts. war is a tricky subject. star trek... tends to swing in the direction of unintentional propaganda. 

to clarify, this isn't about realism. it's a melodrama. i don't seek literal realism in a genre that sets out to be a dim echo of reality at best. i do want it to *feel* real. good fiction will convince you of the most unbelievable things. this particular aspect leaves me unconvinced.",does anyone feel the entire franchise is consistently written in a really juvenile way?
1,"I would have rewritten the series so that the synthetics end up summoning the Q.

Imagine how fucking amazing it would have been a this build up, the portal gets activated and Q just show's up, turns to the Android's and says


 ""Ok where would you like to go live?""

Everyone is standing there stunned, Q turns to then an says

""Oh please you organics and your prophecies, I always told the Continuum that the warning was far too apocalyptic""

Picard calls down from his ship 

""What is going on down there?""

Q responds

""Jean Luc  you didn't really believe that we would destroy all organic life how banal and uncreative, we simply wanted to ensure synthetics had a chance to properly flourish and live up to their potential""

The Romulan fleet move to attack

Q waves his hand and their ships disappear

""Well enough of that"" he turns to the Android's ""and you my distant distant cousins where can I take you on what planet would you like to make your home, if you're comfortable here I can simply rearrange some things""



Kinda a shit post and yes the entire show would need to be rewritten around this ending but God damn the entire time I'm watching and going where the hell is the Q? aren't they supposed to be pretty much involved in any galaxy-wide Extinction? Does anyone really believe the Q would sit around and let humanity be wiped out by some other seemingly omnipotent being? To Q it would be like watching someone kill your puppy and doing nothing

Just my 2 cents",The biggest missed opportunity in Picard
1,"Now I've been alive almost as long as trek has been on the air,  so yes I'm an old trekkie,  but I do have a question, While I like the visual styling,  I wonder we do have evidence from ds9/voyager that the uniforms are one way, but then they are another way in picard,   the 3d interface, we know it's a thing,  which is cool.  

But why has everything ship wise taken on a huge discovery feel and look?  the ships themselves also look like they went backwards to 23rd century designs.    was this because of the wars? and the lack of the ability for the federation to rebuild quickly?  I'm so confused on this, I remember tos era, tos movie era and then bam tng era and I had the same questions back then basically.",Visual changes why?
1,"So I recently watched Chain of Command and I won't gush too much but suffice to say the episode earns its status and reputation. Strangely despite initially disliking Gul Madred I actually ended up liking him in some sense. I know that sounds weird, but I wasn't expecting him to get the character development that he did, which coupled with the fine acting of David Warner gave a full picture of his character that I appreciated rather than some one dimensional monster. I also like how he actually seems to have a good deal of respect for Picard despite being his torturer and I think some of the best moments in the episode are when he accidentally let's his guard down around Picard. There's almost a strange Stockholm Syndrome dynamic in a way.


However my question lies at the end of the episode in the infamous 'four lights' scene. After being told he is too be released just after one last torturous move by Madred Picard defiantly shouts that there are four lights, despite believing there are three. As Picard is dragged away we see his torturer give a little smile. Initially I assumed he was smiling out of an admiration for Picard, knowing that the respect he had come to have for him was earned, but when the episode ended I reflected on the smile again wondering if Madred knew that he had cracked Picard and was pleased with himself, if he understood that in the end his captive truly believed there were five lights. I'm wondering if anyone else has given this much thought and if so what conclusions you've come to, would love to hear some discussion about this and anything else about the two part episode really. I'm not sure what the general consensus is but I feel like they also gave a good deal of character development to Captain Jellico and I'm glad he wasn't just a straight up asshole if you'll excuse the term. Despite not liking him overall (not disliking either) I actually felt like Riker was being unreasonable at times and maybe a little arrogant, while also seeing both men's side. Very good episode.",I have a character question about Gul Madred in TNG's 'Chain of Command'. Looking for some discussion.
1,"Ok, so I know this is probably a foolish question to ask on a subreddit called ""Star Trek"" but I'm doing it anyway. Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek in order? The reason I'm asking this is because I know many of the big moments that happen in the franchise. I know about Spock's death, Kirk's death, ""Kahn!!!!!!!"", Picard's transformation into a Borg, the Voyager making it back to Earth, Data's death, and some other small things. I really want to watch the show because I have a desire to explore and see the unknown, but I'm afraid the series has been ruined for me since I know most of the major plot points. What do you guys think? Should I do it?",Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek from beginning to end?
1,"So there’s been a lot of debate about the different captains: Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Sisko.

But what about the second in command, their “Number Ones”?


I’ve taken the liberty of ranking them from worse to worst, and starting off the list we have... 

Riker: Picard’s faithful right hand, who was a little too happy with his lot. Instead of moving up in the ranks, like you’re supposed to, Riker was seemingly obsessed with his captain and stayed on year after year. He passed on multiple opportunities to become captain, despite the problems this created. (Namely: Holding back other officers who wanted to be promoted to Riker’s position.)


Kira: Who somehow managed to become Sisko’s second in command despite having a background as a... Terrorist. Kira constantly second guessed Sisko, and never missed a chance to become involved in some conflict of interest when it came to Bajor. Rather than being a neutral party, Kira would either make enemies of Bajorian political and religious leaders, or become involved with them romantically.


And the worst of the worst?


Chakotay: Who not only joins Kira in having “terrorist” on the resume, but also was so immersed in his ancestral, new age mumbo jumbo, that his spirit animal probably would have made a more competent Commander. 

We’re talking about a man so utterly irresponsible, that he (on at least one occasion) risked the ship and entire crew **because of a peyote fueled vision quest!**",Who was the worst number 1?
1,"the Set up of voyager was so unique and had such promise. 2 crews, 1 from a new starship with mostly Junior officers left,  the other a rag tag team of terrorists/ freedom fighters who hate the federation almost as much as the Cardassians. Both crews commanded by captains who couldn't be more different.  Janeyway was a veteran of star fleet but she didn't have a lot of real world command experience. Chakotay rejected an already brilliant career starfleet and embraced being a cold and calculating rebel leader. But with Voyager so far from any allies or supplies they had not choice but to work together to find a way home.  The 2 crews would have amazing conflicts and problems we'e never seen in star trek before. 

Well pretty much all of that was dropped during the first season.  The 2 crew conflicts were entirely dropped and rarely even mentioned again, Voyager's isolation and inability to properly resupplyor repair became more like a continuity error running gag.  Janeway was rewritten to be completely schizophrenic and Chakotay, who was set up and acted so well at the beginning of the show  just turned into stat trek's biggest nothing burger. Voyager isn't star trek's worst series, but it's complete waste of it's immense potential will always be it's only achievement for me.",The wasted potential of Voyager always pissed me off
1,"Not sure if this could ""technically"" be considered a spoiler, but better safe-than-sorry I guess.

I'm watching BBCAmerica, and they're airing the famed Bruce Maddox episode about Data's sentience. (""*The Measure of a Man*"") This is the first time I've watched the episode since I started watching Picard.

Now having watched the entire first season of Picard, I find myself watching this episode with new eyes. 

The episode seems to have more weight... seems to be more *special*. 

What do you think? Have you gone back and watched this episode yet? What are your thoughts now, as opposed to pre-Picard?",Does Picard change your view of TNG?
1,"1) Where did Maddox get the image for Dahj and Soji

It's established in the first episode that those twins were modled after Data's painting ""Daughter"". This is latter confirmed when they crewe find Maddox at Freecould. However it's also confirmed nobody except Picard had access to that painting. Given his reaction isn't ""Well someone probably space-googled it"", it feels safe to say that was a private painting. Maybe Maddox asked the Data simulation, but then why didn't Data ask someone to be terminated before? When Picard asks if he's immortal Alton states ""we were all listening"". This seems to be a reference to what Data said but it could easily be what Picard said when telling everybody what happened when he talked to Data again after being put into the Golem. We don't see any monitors or ways to look into the Data simulation so the latter seems more likely.

2) Where did Maddox get a neuron from Data's brain?

In the first episode Jurati doesn't believe Maddox could have created any androids becouse he would have needed ""a single neuron from Data's positronic net"" to completely re-create it. While it can be argued this is more symbolic, in the opening credits we see a single ""atom-thing"" split into to and start forming artificial DNA and an eye, which suggests the new android parts are ""grown"" (in pairs) from the one neuron. But it's never explained HOW he got that neuron when Data's body was completely destroyed. Did he venture to the several year old site of the battle from Nemesis and painstakingly look for a single neuron? Did he use B4, and if so why arn't the new androids less developed as that would be re-growing B4's positronic net, not Data's.

3) Why is Data a formless consciousnesses (in universe, it makes sense thematically and for the plot)

I'm perfectly fine accepting Maddox re-built Data's positronic net, then studied and improved upon it to make the superior new androids (contractions, complex emotions, etc). However, when we meet Data again, he's consciousness was restored and put into a ""highly complex quantum simulation"" without any real form. My question is why? If the process of re-creating Data's positronic net (seemingly a physical thing) is actually just restoring code then how did Maddox get any useful information to create the new androids? Not to mention where did he put Data's consciousness if he didn't have a positronic brain for it, as he had yet to study Data. If Maddox did completely restore Data's brain but not his body, why didn't he just build Data a new body when he was able to? Or for that matter build him a ""fully human"" one like Dahj and Soji? Or why not steel B4 when he left and just replace the brains? Or steel Lore for that matter (who was stored somewhere at Starfleet after TNG). They mentioned Data's memories caused B4's net to fail so it wouldn't me murder of any kind.

4) Brain and brain, what is brain?

On a final note Data's new brain doesn't appear to be his old one at all. When Picard pulls the plug, he literally pulls out 3 isolinear-like chips, each one ""ages"" his consciousness. However if the whole point of restoring Data was to study his brain, why is he now stored on 3 chips? You could argue these chips store the simulation while Data is hooked up inside the machine, but then what Picard did isn't death, it's just pulling his off switch which can be turned on at any point. If Data was moved from his brain so Maddox could story it by destroying it then what was he moved to if nobody could build a positronic net that sophisticated?

1,"I realize it's not officially a separate timeline, but it kind of feels like it. 

In Discovery you have Section 31 operating basically openly, doing shady shit to make the Federation more powerful,  and also the Admirals pardoning a xenocidal tyrannt to get her help in destroying an entire planet to win a war.

1,"Recently, the moderation staff was talking over the uncharted possibilities of April Fools gags we could feature on the subreddit today. Most of us agreed that, given the global situation, it may not be the right time for tomfoolery. In lieu of a prank or biting satire, we're instead interested in sharing with the community one of the things that Star Trek does best: hope. 

We discussed it and came up with a few episodes that always leave us feeling optimistic and uplifted, and we would love to hear from the community about what in Star Trek can always bring the light, even in dark times. 

##Star Trek: Discovery
* S02E02 ""New Eden"": Pike, Burnham, and Owosekun beam down to a planet of WWIII-era humans who have created an aggregate religion and have left behind science, and only Discovery can save them from an impending natural disaster. In the end, there is an everlasting ember of hope left with the people of the planet, even if they don't all know its true nature. 

##Star Trek: Enterprise
* S02E02 ""Carbon Creek"": In this episode, T'Pol tells an ostensibly apocryphal story about the real first landing of Vulcans on Earth, of her 'great-grandmother' experiencing humans in rural America in the 1950s. The episode is lighter in tone than many of the series, and explores acceptance, learning about new cultures, and discovering things to be cherished in the most unexpected places. 
* S02E24 ""First Flight"": Basically, this episode is what was originally conceived to be the first season, a Star Trek adaptation of  the early NASA missions a la *The Right Stuff*. It's pure Star Trek: optimistic and hard working people who solve a seemingly insurmountable obstacle because they're fueled by the motivation of exploration. 

##Star Trek: the Original Series
* S01E19 ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"": After the Enterprise is thrown back to the 1960s, the crew has to rescue a fighter pilot without damaging the timeline at such an important moment in human history. Somewhat like ""First Flight"", this episode is centered around the 1960s optimism-fuel that was the space race, and predicted eventual missions to Saturn. 
* S02E15 ""The Trouble with Tribbles"": Adorable, funny, sweet, with a kitschy whodunit, it's impossible to finish this episode without a big smile on your face. Particularly for those sheltering with beloved pets, this is a must-watch. 

##Star Trek: the Next Generation
* S05E25 ""The Inner Light"": largely considered one of the best episodes of any series, ""The Inner Light"" is a meditation on life, even the most humble life, and all of its complexity and pain and beauty. The episode is unmissable. 
* S06E15 ""Tapestry"": a personal favorite, Jean-Luc Picard is critically injured on an away mission, and Q shows up to play the role of Clarence in allowing Picard to see what his life would have been like had he made a decision differently. This is a perfect episode to help one process regret and the very ending is one of the most beautiful character moments for Picard. 

##Star Trek: Deep Space Nine 
* S03E22 ""Explorers"": a classic episode of exploration, honoring the explorers of the past, and overcoming adversity, with some beautiful father-son character moments along the way. And having Gul Dukan eat crow at the end is the icing on the cake. 
* S06E14 ""One Little Ship"": hey, remember that time the Rubicon was smaller than a hotwheel and they beat a bunch of Jem'Hadar? It's impossible not to have a great time with this episode. 

##Star Trek: Voyager
* S04E36 ""Hope and Fear"": This episode is about hope, then not hope, then hope again. In this hope sandwich, Voyager is made aware of the USS Dauntless, a Federation ship with an experimental propulsion system that could mean getting home. While all is not what it seems, both seeing the crew given hope by this possibility and the wonderful discovery in the end something wonderful does happen. 
* S06E09 ""Blink of an Eye"": This one's got it all: timefoolery, space-race-era alien astronaut, ancient astronauts, Daniel Dae Kim, and most of all seeing a planet go from pre-Industrial to post-Voyager, and seeing them take responsibility for saving themselves and saving Voyager. And that last shot.

What the ever loving fuck?

This episode features a friendly and advanced alien race that clearly keeps its third gender as chattel slaves. Yet the episode seems to harp on cultural acceptance, and after the Cogenitor’s request for asylum is denied and she kills herslef, it’s framed as some kind of important lesson for Tuck? The only person in this persons life of ever treated her like a person?

What the hell am I missing here? Captain Archer ranting about how it’s not our right to judge their culture, feeling like an entirely different character than the one who broke imprisoned Suliban from that concentration camp. Tuck seems to accept that he is mainly at fault, as opposed to his Captain who forced a slave to return to their master?

Before 2 days ago, I had never seen a full ST episode or movie. I knew about Klingons and Spock's ""live long and prosper"" haha signal. I also knew Professor X was the captain. Aaand that's pretty much it.

Corona yadda yadda, time on my hands. Let's dive in proper. I googled where to start. Everyone says the old school show. Ok. I was shocked to learn ""The Original Series"" was only on the air for 3 years.

5 episodes in, I'm starting to get a feel for the gist of the concept, but I'm absolutely dying. I've already seen the same set used twice. This hurts. I'm spoiled. I know. I keep going. By episode 7, I need something else. I skip ahead to season 3. To episodes in, I can't take anymore. I jump to the first move from the late 70's.

Ok. Now this is where I start to get pissed.

I am sure, back in the day, this was a magnitudinous event. Ten years of no Star Trek, and now a high budget movie. I get it. People were stoked. This, of course, was before my time. I wouldn't know. But I can guess.

Kirk meets Scotty. Oh the joy. Kirk sees The Enterprise... And FOR TEN MINUTES boards it. The epic music. Dragging. Dragging. Oh my God, it's dragging. Then Kirk meets ""Bones"" McCoy. I still don't know why he calls him that. Holy shit, another epic meetup. Then The Enterprise takes off into space in another dull sequence. Oh my God, it's so slow. Then Spock shows up. Great, he's awesome. But he sucks in this movie. WTF - I'm an HOUR into this shit and NOTHING has happened.

Seriously, guys, I'm pissed. I've invested like 9 or 10 hours of my life into this and all I want is Chewbacca.

1,"SPOILERS FOR PICARD/DISCOVERY(maybe)

**Don’t just downvote as nutrek hate, I don’t hate any of it,** I’m just looking for people’s perspective. 

I mean the whole plot of Picard doesn’t really count as world building in my mind. It’s just story telling. They aren’t writing any new LORE (not data’s brother, I mean worldbuilding) 

For instance, today I saw an episode of voyager, the one where belanna visits the barge of the dead. A whole hour dedicated to exposition on Klingon death beliefs and there was another voyager episode where fake kaless shows up, another whole hour dedicated to exposition on the deep inner workings of Klingon society. Not to mention worfs multiple sagas and that’s like I dunno at least 10 more hours revealing the inner workings of Klingon politics, expectations, roles in their society, etc. not to mention ds9 and what we learn about cardassians. Remember that whole episode dedicated to a cardassian lawyer and his daily life in court and we learn about cardassian justice system. We learn so much about these societies and it’s fascinating. 

Then discovery comes along, what do we learn? Klingons bad, unite for battle. That’s.... shallow. A traitor captain in the mix didn’t add anything of interest either... again just story telling. No world building. 

Same in Picard, all we really learn about the romulans is there happens to be a bunch who hate androids and try to kill em. Ok but.... what else? So simplistic and shallow. Nothing built... just a story in the framework of existing lore. 

The universe (of lore) is no longer being built and this deeply disappoints me. 

Anyone else feel similarly?","I feel like 90s/classic trek constantly did “world building”, but modern Trek “only tells stories” in what was previously established. They stopped fleshing out the universe. This is why I feel disappointed in new Trek."
1,"Seriously I have enjoyed Enterprise from season 2 onwards, I don't see how it could be so hated while so much stuff is agreed to be worse. While I hated Discovery I disliked a lot of TNG, DS9 and VOY episodes that seem equally terrible so I find it hard to see why a series that seems like a really good entry point to a new viewer or a place for old viewers to find so much hate would be able to take up so much conversation. Some of these episodes are well good and I feel like a lot of them deserve proper consideration

This is not an edit, but for the purpose of your criticism the only series I really genuinely dislike is Discovery. I do dislike individual episodes of the others quite a bit though. Criticise and advise as you see fit","Why is Enterprise so good, and why is it so often left as the worst trek in people's opinions"
1,"I have never seen Star Trek before, that was, until tonight when I came across 'Deep Space Nine' on NetFlix.  Just finished episode five where Tosk, whom of which I guess is considered to be an 'alien' that crashed into their region of the galaxy, needed their help woth repairing his ship.

I like the storyline and occasional humor.  The brown dude with huge ears plays a very cool character as well.

Before getting to much further into 'Deep Space Nine, are there episodes I should be watching first?",Just started watching Star Trek (Deep Space Nine) for the first time. I'm in love already.
1,"Or is it just because we are all cooped up in isolation because of this pandemic? I feel like the negativity towards the new Trek has been more apparent lately. In general, I can't agree with all the hostility being thrown at PIC or DISCO. My Parents are Trekkies and I grew up watching TNG and VOY. And even though PIC has some imperfections, I really enjoyed the story as a whole. Hell, I'm one of the few who loved DISCO season 2 and cannot wait for Season 3.

But come on people. Can we stop with all this hate towards the new Trek? Yeah I get that times are tough, but don't take it out on Kurtzman and Chabon. They are just as much Trekkies as the rest of us. They might not give you the perfect story, but neither would any of us.

I think the problem that New Trek faces, is it can't just be good, it has to live up and outdo the expectations of any Star Trek fan. An episode of PIC or DISCO isn’t compared to the actual quality of your average episode of TNG or TOS, it’s competing with the concept of ‘STAR TREK’ in the collective memories of Star trek fans.

So PIC, which is basically your average peak-tv era show with some fun ideas and details thrown in, gets seen by so many people through this extreme framing that makes it impossible, for a contingent of people to enjoy it for what it is. This is just my take on why the negativity is so bad. 

And I can't emphasize this enough. This is not an attack on the people who have very strong opinions about DISCO and PIC. I just want to help you guys see that perhaps, you are judging the newest Trek, much too hard. I think there was a lot of good that came form PIC season one. And I think the DISCO has a lot to offer too. I hope we can all try see the positives, among these trying times.",Does this community really have so much distaste for new Trek?

(There's a nice hole in the bulkhead, and Kira has minor burns which are being treated.)

RIKER: You crossed the replicator power converter with the plasma manifold, I take it?

KIRA: That's right.

RIKER: Nice work. You know I'll have that thing bypassed in thirty minutes.

KIRA: At least that'll be thirty minutes that we're visible.

RIKER: Fortunately, I was able to take us into a nebula. No one's going to see us.

(Tamal finishes tending to Kira.)

KIRA: Thanks.

(Tamal leaves)

RIKER: You're lucky you only got singed. You know the whole plasma relay could've exploded.

KIRA: Yeah, that was the idea.

RIKER: You've been fighting Cardassians most of your life. I know that you sympathise with what we're doing here.

KIRA: I fought the Cardassians because they invaded my home. You don't live in the Demilitarised zone, you don't have family there. Why are you in this fight?

RIKER: *Because people are dying in the Demilitarised zone and Starfleet isn't doing anything about it.*

KIRA: Taking the Defiant only raises the stakes. The Cardassians are going to send a fleet after you. They are going to kill more people hunting you down than 
they ever did during those border raids.

RIKER: You're assuming the Defiant is going to stay in the Demilitarised zone. Let's go to the bridge. I think we'd all feel better having you someplace we can keep an eye on you.",This sounds familiar.
1,"Ok so here is my question, Data was basically redownloaded from B-4 into a computer matrix after nemesis which is why he could appear in picard, but does anyone else feel locking data in a single room without any interaction or stimuli In the room itself is wrong, or was it like a holo suite and he could explore things, or am I just wrong and didn’t quite understand what happened, can someone clear up for me if this is true and he was or wasn’t in a holo suite style program and do you feel it was right if it wasn’t to lock him in there for 20 years.",SPOILERS for ST Picard don’t read on if u haven’t finished the season finale
1,"I am a huge Spock fan and this episode is one of my favorite. However, watching it given the current context the beginning make me cringe. The Enterprise is supposed to deliver an important medicine to a planet with an epidemic. It could be there in 3 days instead of 5. Kirk choose to look after a space phenomenon. Of course, it wasn't suppose to go bad as it was, but even if all went well, it is at least 2-3 hours lost, during which many thing could go wrong, making them lose more time.

Even of the idea was probably from Spock in the beginning, Kirk shouldn't have accepted. It put many lives in danger for basically nothing. There wasn't even coffee in that quasar ;)",Watching TOS: The Galileo Seven
1,"I've noticed tensions seem high regarding the series. As someone who didn't like it very much, I thought I'd say some nice things about it.

\-I really liked Elnor. I thought I'd get some cheap shots at the series with a sword-wielding Romulan teenage ninja with a Badass Catchphrase (TM), but they balanced him by showing him as a vulnerable teen who is good at the one thing, but still very young. I liked him quite a bit by the end.

\-Romulan culture. It's weird--well, in character, I guess--that we know so little about the Romulans despite political tension between the Federation and the Romulan Empire lowkey running throughout all of TNG. The notion of rear doors and secret names and ancient demon queens and secret organizations are all aspects of a believable society that bucks the franchise's trend towards being a monoculture.

\-I love Elim Garak, but Narek is the franchise's best spy in my book. He's interested in intelligence, he works assets, he's clever, he solves problems, and he puts aside his personal feelings to do his job. He's an asshole and a Bad Person, but that's the nature of spying. He's miles above Obsidian Order thugs and the omni-competent-because-the-plot-says-so Section 31.

\-Narek's position was an interesting paradigm. He was the one competent person within his organization and also the only one not initiated via deep emotional trauma. It's an analogy for institutional mores and their ability to ostracize rather than learn from deviance. A sharp contrast to what the Federation should be.

\-I liked Seven of Nine. I eventually stopped watching Voyager because of Seven of Nine. I've only picked up a few episodes since and my impression is that as she expressed herself as a person whose personality is determined in no small part by her Borg upbringing that expression is squelched by her captain because it's not ""human enough."" Seeing Seven making her own decisions (for better or worse) and deciding to do something(s) noble seemed real, consequential, and very welcome to me.

\-The interlaced climaxes. Several episodes featured two climactic events happening at the same time with cuts between them. I've seen a few other shows do this (I think Castlevania Season 3 closes out that way), but I haven't seen Star Trek do it before. It was visually interesting and I enjoyed it.

\-Frakes was great. I didn't go in to this feeling as though I needed any particular callback to previous shows, so each one was a treat. Even more than that though, when Frakes said ""shields up!"" my brain thought for a moment that I had Netflix open to a TNG episode in another tab. Dude sent me back in time about 26 years. I enjoyed that they followed up on All Good Things by showing Picard, Riker, and Troi as friends.

\-Troi's is used better than she probably ever was on TNG. Her empathic powers are used to move our story forward and let us express Picard's feelings despite his recalcitrance. Her non-empathic abilities as a counselor are used well to try and help Soji and Picard work together. 

\-Kestra was a welcome character. They had a lot of presence. Also, I watched the episode twice and didn't notice where Kestra was referred to as a 'she' or 'daughter.' I'm positive they were, but until someone corrects me I'm believing they are--despite their affiliation with Thad's warrior women--Trek's first non-binary character.

\-Even putting that aside, Kestra hunts and kills a dangerous creature, which I think is a great touch for kids in Star Trek. They should be as familiar with the elements of their world--the where-does-my-food-come-from and how-does-my-car-go--as we might expect of adults today. Whether that's the woods of Nepenthe or the city of San Francisco, kids who are healthy, fed, and educated since birth should surprise a modern viewer with their knowledge, discipline, and maturity. Kestra demonstrates that and I'm a fan.

\-Those post-Nemesis, pre-Picard uniforms were really nice. I have strong opinions on Star Trek uniforms and they were top tier.

\-Raffi and Rios had a friendship that seemed to grow from a casual association over the series. The moment when she goes to his replicator to get coffee for him instead of booze for herself crystallizes those two being close and it feels like an earned payoff.",I'd like to say some nice things about Star Trek: Picard
1,"In this somewhat divisive time in the fandom, can’t we all agree to appreciate Leonard “Bones” McCoy?

He’s the heart of the Enterprise and a gentlemen to boot. He is the most compassionate character in the Original Series, and I would argue, the entire franchise as a whole.

The idea of making him a “simple country Doctor” is actually a genius one. He, through his role as an advisory character, manages to humanise the crew and the show, that at the time ran the risk of alienating the audience. 

When others mention the wonderfully in depth portrayal by Leonard Nimoy, and the charming performance by the Shatner himself, people tend to forget the man who brought such a dynamic character to life.
Deforest Kelley managed to play a grumpy old lovable and kind man we all know and should love.
He set the standard on how the Doctors are written in later shows, and managed to play a hilarious yet important man who always managed to do or say the right thing.

While later Doctors would probably beat him in term of amazing feats, McCoy was always the heart and soul of the Enterprise and became the confidante of one of the popular Captains of all time. 

His speech in Balance of Terror is one of the greatest in tv history. Seriously it’s so good. Go and watch it. It needs to be talked about more. It’s beautiful. 

For these reasons and more, he is my favourite character in the entire Trek universe.",Can We All Just Appreciate McCoy for a Second?
1,"35 year Trek fan here. Last year I undertook a complete rewatch of TNG in preparation for the new show, finishing up with Nemesis in January a few days before the premiere. I grew up on TNG and my excitement was through the roof. 

I found Picard to be a solid season of television with some faults throughout, but ultimately satisfying in the end. Despite other people's comments to the contrary, Jean Luc felt very much like Picard to me from the beginning (although changed of course) and it was great to see him become a leader again as the season went on.

Picard season 1 wasn't perfect and I have issues with many aspects of it, from set design to writing decisions, but I always looked forward to each episode and would rate each episode 6 or higher out of 10 (most were probably in the 7 range). Something about the show also felt disjointed from episode to episode at times and I feel like the new characters didn't get enough time to shine/develop. I also think that interesting character aspects, such as Raffi's addiction or most anything about Elnor were completely cut unfortunately. Of course, it has only been 10 episodes so some of these complaints are definitely not fair. I mean look at where the other Trek shows were after 10 episodes!

Prior to the premiere, my expectations were unrealistically very very high. Despite this, I feel like the show mostly met them and I think that says a lot about the great work the writers/directors/cast did.  I also think it is easily Star Trek's best first season.

Bring on season 2!",My Short Picard Review
1,"A few months ago I decided to further my Trek education by watching Enterprise. From this subreddit I know it’s not the most popular Trek, but given Voyager is my current favourite, I thought it was worth a watch. I’ll be honest it took me longer to get into, but by the end I’ll admit I liked it. The premise was interesting, and the character development was good. Also Phlox is a delight in every scene he’s in, and as a Brit seeing Reed in Star Trek was very pleasing. 

Anyway, I watched the final episode tonight, and possibly isolation is taking its toll, but I was devastated. Here are my main 3 issues:

1. Simulation
The whole premise of the episode’s story being a holodeck simulation run by Riker really irritated me. The characters I’d grown so attached to being computer programs in their last appearance just felt wrong. His decision to disobey orders was also a league away from Trip’s decision. The whole idea of Riker using a simulation in which he mostly impersonates a chef to make a critical decision just seemed weird.

2. Timing
The timing for the episode was really off. Why did it need to be the day of Enterprise’s decommissioning? Why did it need to be the day of the coalition signing? Six years of adventures just swept over and ignored and it felt very forced. I would have been on board if they fast-forwarded  to the actual forming of the federation, but they didn’t.

3. Trip’s Death 
I know its Trek tradition to kill a major character in a show (Yarr, Kes etc.) but killing them in the last episode is just daft. Especially when its one of the main 3 - the gut punch being entirely negated by it happening a mere 20 minutes before the show ending. What makes character deaths so powerful is watching the characters react and emphasising with them. We got hardly any of that in Trip’s death. It felt so weird and forced I genuinely expected him to emerge from  the shadows and take T’Pol’a hand as Archer gave his speech. 

I understand a lot of my issues stem from it being cancelled before its time. Believe me, I’m no stranger to a rushed ending (I’ve watched BBC’s Merlin) but Enterprise could have ended so perfectly either by just going off into their new adventure (these ARE the voyages) or simply with Archer’s speech in the previous episode.

So there you have it, ramblings about an ending that took place over 10 years ago from someone who barely qualifies as a trekkie. I just wanted to know if the trek community as a whole agreed or disagreed with my view.",Thoughts on Enterprise’s Ending
1,"For all people claim that we just want a repeat of TNG, I've never actually seen anyone seriously express this opinion in my 20+ years involvement in this fandom. If anything people criticize ENT and VOY as trying too hard to recreate TNG, and the most popular episodes of those respective shows are the ones that do their own thing.

My issue with Discovery, Picard, and the Bad Robot Films is that they ARE rehashes of the old shows.

Oh boy, another actor to play Spock, another super secret Spock sibling, another super secret Soong family member, tribbles, another evil robot trying to kill the universe, oh boy it's the borg again, oh boy it's klingons again, oh boy it's the mirror universe again, oh boy it's Khan again only he's white this time, oh boy Spock says the Khan line instead of Kirk this time, oh boy it's Sarek again, remember Sarek? I could keep going for days.

Sure, people love to point out episodes like Relics or Unification or Trials and Tribble-ations, but these episodes were exception rather than the rule. By and large Star Trek is not a franchise that references itself often, and even when it does was usually in a way that most people would miss it.

It's notable to me that outside of a couple flashbacks, the Borg never appear in DS9. The Dominon don't show up in VOY or ENT. Outside of a blink and you'll miss it diagram, tribbles never show up in TNG or VOY. These are shows celebrated for their differences rather than their similarities, and the commonalities they do share only serve to enhance the believably of the fictional universe they inhabit. 

I, and I'd wager most Star Trek fans, would have been perfectly happy with a new crew on a new ship boldly going where no man has gone before, commenting on modern political topics like Star Trek has always done. 

Which makes it all the more disappointing that for the last 11 years (and arguably even before that) this franchise has been driving in circles while stuck in first gear, revisiting the same tired characters, same tired tropes, same tired plotlines, and same tired locales. If you took away all the old characters and ""member this"" moments, what would this house of cards have to stand on?

At this point I would be perfectly happy if we never saw Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Tribbles, Klingons, the Borg, Picard, Data, or even the Enterprise itself ever again. I welcome the opportunity for new characters to fall in love with, new ship designs to become my favorite, new iconic aliens to enjoy, and new ideas and political concepts to think about and debate. 

It's a shame I haven't been given the opportunity in a very long time.

If seeing all the old stuff again but with new actors or updated graphics is what does it for you I guess I can't really begrudge you for that. I wish I shared your position, I do like enjoying things believe it or not. But I personally have all my DVD's and BluRays for whenever I wish to relive the past, and more than anything I wish this franchise would give me the opportunity to have new favorites again.",Star Trek is stuck in the past.
1,"I'm planning on watching TNG with my gf sometime soon; it will be my second time watching the show and her first. As much as I'd love to watch all 178 episodes (over 130 hours), we both have full time jobs in addition to all the other things we want to get to together. As such, I've gone through to try and find the episodes we should definitely watch, skipping some of the bad or just 'meh' ones based on what I can remember from almost 10 years ago and what I can find online.

1,"Early on in the season, I felt that I liked Dahj a lot more than Soji. I thought the feeling was unfounded, they're (almost) the same character, and we barely knew Dahj to begin with. But reflecting on the season as a whole, I feel that the show would have worked a lot better if we'd had Dahj instead of Soji.

Dahj was the everyday character - someone just going about their daily lives, who suddenly has their life upended. She's lost and scared and suddenly apart of something much bigger than she ever imagined. ...A standard sci-fi cliche, sure, but it's standard because it works. Dahj was a bit more relatable and likable for it, whereas Soji had no idea what was going on until 6 episodes in, and then within 1 she had to both come to terms with who she was, and learn to trust Picard. 

Imagine Dahj survives the attempt on her life in the first episode. She now becomes worried for her sister, who she believed worked at a Federation shipyard, but this also turned out to be a lie. Picard promises to help her find and save her sister. 

Dahj is around as the crew is assembled and as they go about looking for Soji. She slowly forms friendships with them in her own way, as she starts to rediscover who she is. At one point she asks Picard about Data, pointing out that with his abilities, he was close to being a perfect human. Picard tells her that Data only used his android abilities when necessary, preferring to do things as humanly as possible. That Data acknowledged that being flawed and imperfect was a significant part of the human experience, as was learning to overcome those flaws.

The Soji/Narek stuff plays out the same, except this time, he successfully kills her. Picard and Dahj get there too late, as the Romulan fleet is off to the Synth homeworld. Dahj is upset over her sister's death, and can't help but to blame Picard. She knows it's unfair, but she can't help but to be disappointed - he promised her, and he let her down.

So when they're on the Synth homeworld, and the other Synths offer her this vision of utopia, she buys into it. She's grieving her sister, disappointed in Picard...what's so great about humans, anyway? They fail and make mistakes and people get hurt because of it.

Picard's appeal to Dahj would then remind her of Data's way of life - accepting failure and flaws, and learning to overcome them. How learning to grow from past mistakes is a part of being human. This would inspire her to believe in Picard and shut down the beacon. And give more weight to the sacrifice Picard was willing to make for her.",Picard: The other sister was better...

We know Raffi has a son, so although of course there are other ways to have kids, let's assume she was with a man.  At the end of Voyager, Seven seemed to have fallen in love with Chakotay. 

What happened to Chakotay? Is he the one that turned her all vigilante with his Maquis mindset? Even the mention of him next season would make me happy.

1,"I get that there are a lot of people that like Enterprise or think it's over-hated/underrated. I just don't know if I can watch it right now during quarantine though, the pilot alone made me and my wife quit at the gel-rubbing scene and pick up CBS streaming for Discovery and Picard. 

I have stomached a lot of *hilariously* awful ST plots throughout all the series so far, and nothing in them could have prepared me for how genuinely intolerable and unlikable every character in ENT has been so far. Does it get *any* better for people who are similarly rolling their eyes at the portrayal of the women on the show (not just sexualization tbh) and generally annoyed by the combative nature of everyone on the crew? DS9 and Voyager didn't always have crews be agreeable, cooperative, or even likeable, but it usually was the sum of a compelling plot point, theme, or a character flaw rather than the characters *being the flaw*.

I know the show is already polarizing but ST to me is about philosophy and intellectually stimulating plots, which remain pertinent in the writing even during long war arcs in DS9 or in interpersonal soapy drama episodes of every series. It just doesn't seem like that's in ENT at all. It's like they wanted to make the most boring Michael Bay aspiring sci-fi possible. Is there any hope or should I just skip it? I might go back to it during a less stressful time when I can make ""Space George W. Bush"" into more of a case study but these days I need to actually watch good TV if I watch any at all. I am still laughing at the idea that people actually made this show and that seemingly every single decision about it so far has been completely wrong in the context of Star Trek writing and worldbuilding and characterization.

1,"Hey all, I was just realizing this after watching them back-to-back. Here's what I noticed:


* We have both Picard and The Doctor traveling from and among their three different times periods.

* In both shows, there is a being causing their time shifting who is also standing judgment on them: Q/Rose Tyler (Bad Wolf)(The Moment)


* In both, the oldest looking version causes the cataclysm (Grandpa/Old Picard)

* At some point, multiple copies of the Enterprise and TARDIS have to team up to achieve their mission


Can't think of more than that. Just thought it was notable.

Thanks!",TNG's 'All Good Things' and Doctor Who's 'Day of the Doctor' are eerily similar (Spoilers)
1,"So my friend and I were recently discussing movies and Star Trek. I posed the question to him: What are some of the best Star Trek movies that aren't actually Star Trek movies? That is, movies that could totally be great Star Trek movies if they had originally been written into the universe.

Two we came up with immediately were:

* Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)
* Galaxy Quest (1999)

Obviously Galaxy Quest is a bit on the nose but I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas. A quick internet search didn't help much so I figured I'd pose the question here.",Best non-Trek Trek Movies
1,"I just looked on my Youtube feed and saw a video titled ""Why Star Trek Picard FAILED"" with some 200k views. Instead of linking to it, I'm going to go on a moderately tilted rant.

The people who make these videos are not fans of Star Trek. They exist to farm your views for their own benefit (money).

There is no evidence to support that Picard did bad. Make your own judgments on whether or not you liked it. Every single influencer out there seems to bee unrealistically critical of a show that I enjoyed heavily, and it's creating a toxic (for the lack of a better word, sorry) environment where if TNG came out today, it would be seen as a bad show.

I don't know what these people are expecting, and honestly I don't care.","Star Trek Picard did not ""Fail"", it was in fact a magnificent success (sorry, rant)."
1,"1. Filled with incredibly empty 'reluctant hero' gestures: Seven of Nine, Raffi, Rios, and Elnor all had instant ""100% I will not... Okay, I'll go"" moments. This is a problem of writing. Raffi did this shit 3 times.

2. Romulans don't behave like Romulans. It is obvious this is a problem of direction. They behave like humans with some prosthetic ears. The actors appear to be given no guidance as to how a Romulan carries themselves in all other trek.

3. Modern Stylistic/Content choices like: more camera movement, lens flair, hot characters having sexy time, everything looks Green Screen... are okay to have, if it suits the narrative. Instead the camera seems to listlessly move to capture a cool angle when the moment doesn't call for it. This is the problem with Michael Bay. ""Every shot is given equal weight visually."" If everything is of max importance, nothing is important. (Why is it So Hard to Remember What Happens in Transfomers? by Lindsay Ellis provides a perfect example why this is a bad use of film language)

4. Lack of philosophy with an overabundance of attempts to seem profound. This has gotten better in later episodes.

5. At this point it doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. This is a different show. I understand that. Enterprise didn't really feel like Star Trek some of the time to me. But this has very fleeting moments of being Star Trek. Like it is just using the Trek mythology and world very little at that.

6. Picard is not inspiring. This is very jarring to a Star Trek fan and to me diminishes the whole point of the show. This has gotten better in later episodes and perhaps this is a part of the narrative growth for Picard.

7. It ignores the history of the galaxy. Voyagers return and the Dominion War have had no mention or seemingly no impact on geopolitical nature of the Galaxy. 

8. Not talking to the computer and hearing the computer respond is such an atmospheric Star Trek thing that is absent here.

9. Elnor should not have been convinced to leave but rather trying to convince Picard to go with him. This was backwards.

10. Soji &amp; Narek sleep on a way too small bed.

&amp;#x200B;

What Picard is doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Transformation of the Borg to a defeated resource that scavengers are exploiting is really amazing.

2. Agnes is perfect. Her character has been told perfectly so far. The reveal of her romantic connection with Maddox was handled, beautifully and provided my first moment of real emotional devistation. 

3. The EMH's have a similar dynamic that made the Voyager EMH doctor such a good character.

4. The Innari bodyguard (Vop) is a great Star Trek type species. Distinctly NOT Human. Maybe there should be more of this?

5. The Federation fucking itself up so badly by devolving into racism and shitty self-important leaders, would seem impractical... if it wasn't happening so vividly in real life. This is a big plus.

6. The conspiracy unraveling itself is an example of good writing. The ban, the federation, the Romulans hatred of Synthetics. All interesting questions.

7. Stardust City Rag was the first very good episode because of the swerve involving Sevens past with the Freecloud Boss (a very good villain btw). The costuming, the atmosphere, even the pacing was star trek and more importantly good storytelling. When Agnes did the thing at the end (another perfect and justified swerve) I was flabberghasted and all-in.

&amp;#x200B;

All together its seems like it will be a weak first season. But this is on par with ALL the other treks. They seem to need time to get their footing. I tried to watch the last episode, but the CBS all access player won't let me online. So, i have to watch it tomorrow on my actual television, when other people are awake in my house. Let me know what you think. Stay safe and stay home, everyone.",My Humble Critique of Picard.
1,"Ever since I watched First Contact as a kid, I've always wondered why using 21st century weapons against the Borg were never fully explored. JL seemed to take them out with a holographic Tommy gun with the safeties off, but it was never talked about again. I'd think  of you ship is boarded guns might work for a bit longer before the Borg adapt, I bet they wouldn't be used to metal projectiles being thrown at them when they've been dealing with energy weapons for a long time. So does 21st century weaponry stand a chance longer than phasers or Photon Torpedoes?",Do you think the Borg could adapt to projectile weapons given some time?
1,"Why is it that they figured out how to give holograms human/bio experiences to characters like The Doctor from Voyager (e.g., emotions, humor) but couldn't program those into synths like Data and the others responsible for the Mars attacks until this far into the series? To me, it's all just computer code and the only difference is to whether or not they have a physical body vs a photon body.  


It seems like a convenient story-driven distinction that makes no sense, but if anybody has some info as to why not, please let me know.",PICARD SPOILERS: Newbie-ish question about synths vs holograms
1,"Picard aired and people were excited. Ive liked science fiction for a long while, but really only in movies. I got bored on the 3rd episode of Picard or so. I just thought it felt bland, self congratulatory, and uninspired (ahem, mass effect). 

THE GOOD: This got me thinking. Why do people even like star trek? So I decided I would give it a chance. I went with DS9 because ive always heard it was darker...... WOW WOW WOW WOW. Two weeks later I feel like ive learned so much about myself, I've questioned morality in a macro or micro way (sisko with the poison gas/pale moonlight), and I have witnessed some of the finest performances on tv or cinema. 

People like game of thrones??? The emissary, dukat, the great link, and all the rest of the amazing puzzle pieces were on the verge of perfection to me. Sisko and Dukat are a tour de force imo almost always. 

Next up TNG: Again, incredible in different ways. Its safe to say now I want to watch the OS and Voyager, and anything else good. 

I consider myself lucky. I got a chance to see some of the best media ever produced. Soley because today's attempt at emulating it is so beyond poor. Picard is not Star Trek. I dont know what it is, but man.... i get it now. I feel like people need to do something lol. How can something with decades of greatness be ruined like this? There are talented people that can write good trek. Maybe?",Watched Trek for the first time due to Trek being so bad.
1,"I feel like star trek has gotten so much attention from hollywood lately with the movies and the discovery reboot but now i see st:picard to the end and i cant help to think all of these writers are a cynical and pessimistic bunch of people. Apart from the format in which it presents itself, a serialized story rather than each episode being a standalone adventure, i find that the writers of the movies and the new series cant seem to do justice to universe that gene rodenberry imagined. He seemed to think the future for the human race held great advancements morally and intellectually that just seems to be lost in the new shows. The new shows seem to be just walking dead in space. A bunch of asshole people being assholes all over space. I remember watching star trek TNG and picard in those key moments where his humanity beat the odds an the temptation of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons and i incorporated those moments as part of my moral compass. They were so comoelling and so inspiring but i hate to say i dont feel inspired anymore. I feel like the shows entertain my apetite for great cgi and fantastic acting by patrick stewart. I had such high hopes to get more of those jaw dropping goosebump generating moments and in the end it was entertaining but it gave me nothing near the feeling of a revolutionary way of thinking or behaving such as captain picard used to.

Being a lover of history, politics and social issues, I’ve always found it hopeful to think that humanity will one day reach a mature statue. I’ve only gotten around to watching DS9 recently on Netflix and was completely blown away by the episode “Duet” in season 1. It involves a Cardassian who comes to the station. Kira and Sisko are at odds over whether he is a war criminal. Without spoiling this, I have to say it was a very engaging episode with so many twists and an extremely emotional, thought provoking payoff.

1,"I know its pretty divisive on this subreddit but I have honestly enjoyed Discovery.

Im about 6 episodes into the 2nd season and so far I like it, and the 2nd season in my opinion, is loads better than the first season. Thanks to Captain Pike, easily my favorite character of the series. He reminds me of the standard Starfleet Captain that we have come to expect, a quirky but noble leader. 

Is it perfect? No but I dont think its as bad as people make it out to be. I like Burnham, Pike, Tilly and Soru. I feel like their another fine crew much like previous Trek shows. The production quality is very good, the sets look amazing in my opinion. Its really nice seeing a Trek show with modern quality production between the sets, CGI, costumes, and action choreography. 

I love all the easter eggs and references to past Trek and there are a lot of them despite people claiming the new showrunners dont know Star Trek. I guess my biggest gripe is that I do wish there was more of that classic heartfelt ""diplomacy"" and overall wholesome vibe that the past Trek shows had in my opinion.",Getting caught up on Discovery

This could could be a story about a Federation grappling with trans-humanism. They could tackle stuff like the Ship of Theseus problem and how it applies to humanity.

Huh? Hugh never really turned to violence. I mean he was talking about revolting against the Romulans control over the cube but he didn’t go all medieval on anyone. Also his cause was completely justified and Picard is speaking about him as though he became corrupted at the end. As though he went out less of a human than he was before. It just seems like an odd thing to say. Yeah poor Hugh but not because he turned violence. Poor Hugh because he died trying to do the right thing.",What’s up with this Picard line?
1,"Question for the shared brains trust.

My wife and I are watching DS-9 - we are both Star Trek fans and have watched pretty much every other series.  We have tried DS-9 in the past and just faded away and started watching something else.  Having said that, it is regularly billed as one of the best Star Trek series around, so we thought we'd give it another go.

We are up to Season 1 Episode 16 and we have been struggling.   The episode where Jake and Nod buy  Cardassian yamok sauce?   We skipped it entirely.  Boring and cringey.

Some of the acting is excruiciating.  Watching Avery Brookes as he ""Enunciates.  Every.  Word.  In.  A.  Sentence"".  Some of the character motivations are hard to understand (Hey, Bashir, we get that you like Dax, but can't you take a hint).  Some of the plot lines end up feeling a bit cringeworthy.

Every Star Trek series took a season or so to get going - TNG wasn't brilliant in its first season, it always felt like an 80s TOS to me but once it got its legs, it was great.  Voyager was stronger in its first season, but also improved over time.  

We aren't quite ready to give up yet, but when does it get good?",Watching DS-9 and struggling
1,"In the years after Enterprise, I had two good ideas for Star Trek. One was just a *NEXT* Next Generation. Go on more adventures, with well written stories. I fully reject the concept of Franchise Fatigue. The problem with Trek back then was that the shows simply got bad. But that's not what this is about....

The second idea I had was to have a show that was about the origins of the Borg. But my idea was that it wouldn't be labeled as that. Or even called a Star Trek show. It would be a ""general"" sci fi show about the future that at the end would surprise you by the people in the show ending up becoming the borg.

Today, we are all stuck at home for months. Luckily we have enough technology that we can connect with each other virtually which is good. We are all adjusting our lives so that we can do our jobs and do what we need to do, while minimizing direct contact.

What a great seed for a borg origin story. A virus forces everyone to stay apart and connect electronically. In a civilization with much more advanced technology, and with a quarantine that lasts hopefully a lot longer than our is going to, our every deepening personal connections to the internet could evolve into a collective.",This would make a great borg origin story
1,"I'm watching ""What We Left Behind"" and the response of DS9 at the time and it's very similar to the reaction that Picard just received. Here's the thing, though, cussing aside, DS9 was waaaay darker in tone than Picard. 

 One of the heroes was a former terrorist who showed no regret for her actions, in fact she's proud of them ffs. They even mention in the documentary that they wouldn't be able to get away with some of that stuff today. Not to mention that some of the decisions Sisko made during the Dominion War. Hell, the Dominion War itself. If Nostalgic fanboys are shitting themselves over a Starfleet admiral swearing, imagine their reaction at how Sisko handled the Maquis!

  I smirked when one of the hate letters they read called DS9 ""too politically correct."" The more shit changes the more it stays the same.",How do you think DS9 would've been received today?
1,"It happened to coincide that I watched during the same week the finale of both Picard ans DS9. The interesting thing was how similar both endings were in terms of messed-up events with bad editing. 

I found Picard more ambitious since it inherits 33-year long Data's storyline, extending Soongs, too. The clash between the fleets felt like a true Star Trek (that classic tension on-screen between the adversaries), but it lasted only seconds. And the death of Picard might have been explored far deeper providing he had died several times during TNG (we DO KNOW how and who could ""restore"" Jean-Luc in his genuine human sleeve). I could only imagine how the series would have looked like if not under Kurtzman production...

In DS9, the ending was mostly anticipated, but implemented a bit better. It managed to wrap up multiple arcs, although in a bit unnatural and puzzling way (and one in just appaling). Sometimes it felt like 4- or-5-episode long story was chopped off awkwardly missing many emotional scenes. Fortunately, far less that in Picard.

In both series, we didn't see the ultimate battle of/with supernatural beings - the major flaw IMO. But unlike the Prophets from DS9, we weren't explained convincingly what was the danger/nature of ""the makers of the Admonition"" in Picard.

I mentioned bad endings for some characters in DS9, but it was dictated by the fact of 7-season long build-up. In Picard, such flaw was of much larger scale: why the hell noone noticed the disappearance of Narek? Why Agnes suddenly dodged the justice of murdering Bruce Maddox? The logic of Soji was just random, she behaves in final episode like drunken teenager who also have bipolar disorder.

The coherence of the events were flawed sometimes in horrendous way.  Picard and Agnes escaped the synthetic guards, walked towards the cube, had a talk, repaired the ship, launched up in front of the Romulan fleet that all the time was doing what?... Meanwhile Soong just busy with routine data extraction and Seven probably meditating over her killing Narissa. 

In this aspect DS9 is even worth: we saw two characters chatting around in a cave - like a 15-minute scene, when a long Galactic-scale battle is raged far away, then ended, the whole fleet went back to docks, war-ending formalities had been made and even a nice party held at Fontain's holosuite... not to mention Sisko suddenly becoming a Jedi who knows how to find exact spot on Bajor to face the enemy who's expects him doing just that!

To sum up, Picard was a bad series which ended up in awckwardly good, ""acceptable"" way. What You Leave Behind, instead, is a tight kaleidoscope, not bad yet still not enough for a brilliant saga.

I enjoyed Et in Arcadia Ego a bit more, mostly emotionally. Despite hating Discovery and all this dung associated with Kurtzman.

What would you say?",Picard's vs DS9 endings?
1,"After seeing the trailer for season 3 of Discovery, i was pretty excited, but some memory in the back of my head was bugging me. It took me a while to retrieve it, but then I remembered Kevin Sorbo doing a slow kick around a black hole and it all came back to me. Andromeda: a sci fi series about a crew from a United ""commonwealth"" of planets, flung into the future where their peace loving system of intragalactic government had failed, trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild a better future. All based on unused story ideas by, what was his name? Ah here it is...Gene Roddenberry. Sound familiar? 

I was surprised to find out the show had 5 seasons! I watched it a lot and liked it as a kid, but I really remember almost nothing from it now. I was wondering in general if anyone else remembered it and if they felt there were any lessons Discovery season 3 should take from a show with a nearly identical story concept.

1,"So I've had some thoughts after the end of Picard S1, Discovery, the history of Star Trek, the vociferous fanbase, and some issues regarding modern ST creation. I'm going to keep this short so hopefully discussion can happen.

• Modern Star Trek is being made in season-long story arcs because the production company never knows if the plug will be pulled. This to me is sad.  Picard S1 was good, I liked it, but man that whole season could be the entire series. Seven becoming interim queen should have had much more drama around it. Now we're going to get another season of rushed storytelling simply because the writers are likely barred from planning that far out. Can you imagine if in DS9 the Dominion War was only allowed to be one season? It causes rushed story telling, and the overall thing suffers.  
  \- Discovery does this too. Its becoming a theme with ST.

• I really DO love what they're doing though. They are truly creating some proper fan service by going deep in the lore. I love that, there's an entire universe to utilize, no reason to keep making new enemies, things, and what not.

• All in all I'm happy with modern ST. Even with rushed story telling, I'm happy we're seeing modern trek. I do worry the fanbase will serve to destabilize this all though. We need to collectively regulate ourselves.","Many problems, many strengths. Contains general spoilers."
1,"SPOILERS

I don't buy the Romulans backing down in the finale of *Picard*. Like, if they seriously believe that the synths are going to bring about a galactic apocalypse, than no way are they going to back down just because of a Picard speech about their rights as sapients and a comparably-sized Federation fleet. If they really believe that the galaxy will be destroyed if they don't act, they absolutely would have opened fire on the fleet and attempted to break through to destroy the planet.

Plus, the synths DID IN FACT ACTIVATE the beacon summoning the genocidal extra-galactic AIs, which would absolutely convince the Romulans that they were right all along in their fear of them. And Narek spent that time narrating the Romulan myth of streets being flooded with the blood and entrails of the innocent because these machines.

1,"I just rewatched Nemisis again and as I was watching it I thought that the story really isn't that bad but the fact that Tom Hardy looks absolutely nothing like Patrick Stewart really makes the movie hard to believe.  
  
Despite the fact that Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor it's just too hard to accept that he is a younger version of Patrick Stewart. They have nothing in common. Their voices sound nothing alike, they have totally different accents, different lips, and their facial structure is completely different. They tried to explain this away by saying that Shinzon was disfigured but last time I checked no amount of fighting will give you fuller lips. In fact they only thing that they even had in common at all is that they were both bald although that didn't even make any sense seeing as every time we have seen young Picard had hair.  
  
I think that if they had casted a different actor to play Shinzon people's opinions of the film would be completely different.",Nemesis would have been so much better if the actor they got for Shinzon looked more like Patrick Stewart.
1,"First of all, I really like Voyager so far, but hear me out.

The most obvious offender is Chakotay. It seems all he does is talk about his Native American heritage, which would be weird enough in any show, but seems especially odd in Star Trek when we are supposed to be in a post-nations post-racial future. There is a TOS episode where Abraham Lincolm remarks about Uhuru being integrated into the crew, but Kirk and all the others are so advanced in their thinking they can't even understand what Lincoln is talking about.

This would be less of an issue if Chakotay has a more defined character, but after watching a season and a half all I can tell you about him is basically a series of Native American cliches, with none of the characterization you would expect from a leader of rebels.

He's a pretty common complaint, and I get that the writers were scammed but a fake consultant, but I think theres a few other odd issues in Voyager.

The character of Tuvak seems vaguely racist to me in that the show runners seemed to think that simply making a vulcan black was a character trait. I mean its great to have a diverse cast, but so far there is nothing to differentiate him from Spock, or any other generic Vulcan, except for his skin color. It almost seems to me, the showrunners said, hey lets have a black vulcan, and then stopped writing there. Contract this to the great characterization of Geordi, whose skin color is literally irrelevant to his character. I can tell you that he is a good friend, probably the nicest TNG character, and bad with the ladies. I cant tell you a whole lot about Tuvak.

Please note im not really complaining or calling Voyager racist really. Most of this I think is just mediocre writing. I just find it interesting that it was clearly well intentioned but went wrong, and wrong in ways previous crews from earlier eras didn't go as wrong. Also things you should be aware of if you are writing anything...",Is Voyager accidentally racist?

Visually it looks awesome and realistic if it were possible to do such a thing but I still prefer the older style of a ""Get up to Speed"" way and slowing down gradually like in the TNG/DS9/VGR era of Star Trek. It would have been a little bit more cooler to see Rikers new ship to come swooping in to save the day like how the Enterprise E did in First Contact when the Borg invasion on Earth was happening. The way they do it now is the ships instantaneously pop into a exact place and disappear instantly. Anyone else feel the same way?",How starships go into and drop out of Warp Speed
1,"We start with the stand off between the Romulans and Riker, only this time Cmdr Oh says ""Hell no, I am not backing down! These synths have a switch to end all life in the galaxy! This is unacceptable to us!""

Cmder Oh then claims she has a small fleet on standby near earth ready to seed earth's atmosphere with poisonous radiation if they do so. Riker accuses her of bluffing. She reminds him she infiltrated the deepest reaches of Star Fleet and no one was the wiser, it would be foolish to assume she is bluffing. 

Stand off. 

Picard chimes in and proposes that the communication tower to call Cthulhu is destroyed, all tech and info related to it is destroyed, and that the knowledge of the ability to call the interdimensional destroyers is completely erased from the memory banks of all synths. 

The Synths have a conference and accept this under once condition - The Federation remove the synth ban and give synths full citizenship. 

Picard talks to Federation big wigs, they agree. 

AI Soong oversees the procedure as one after another of the synths has the knowledge permanently removed and all the tech is destroyed. ONce that happens, Cmdr Oh is satisfied, she backs down and returns. 

This way everyone (mostly) gets what they want and the Romulans are not portrayed as 2 dimensional bad guys which bothered me. And the synths gets restored without the Federation simply saying ""oh you almost very nearly destroyed all life in the galaxy? Great, then we lift the ban!"" which wan an absurd plot point.

Say there’s a Betazoid in StarFleet whose job was to make contact with new life. If they could read their minds, wouldn’t it just be gibberish to them?
 The universal translator wouldn’t affect their thoughts presumably.
So how then can they seemingly read the minds of nearly anyone without the issue of a language barrier?

Also what’s the law regarding telepaths? Surely on their planet most crime wouldn’t exist considering they don’t really lie all that much. (At least to each other.) Could a Telepath be used in a court of law? We know this happened during the Klingon War, but that was in desperate times.

Side note considering it takes them until adolescence to develop their abilities, do you think the children try to lie? At least to each other? Or is it just so completely alien to them that they wouldn’t consider it?

I was going to watch Voyager after DS9, but every time I go to watch the first episode, I hesitate, think about how I'm not gonna hear the DS9 theme anymore, then I exit the tab. DS9 was so good! I wish there was more of it. A lot of shows these days have like 20 seasons. I wish DS9 was one of those shows, bringing new characters in over the seasons. 

It would've been so cool to see Kira as the commander of DS9 for a few seasons, then maybe the return of Sisko and finally seeing the Bajoran integration into the Federation, as well as the Federation occupied Cardassia.

1,"TL;DR - The way she saves the day is by using her abilities to effectively steer Picard away from bad decision making (especially within his specialty of negotiations), to make him aware of things he would otherwise not be able to perceive, and to essentially save the crew from disaster by avoiding it in the first place rather than solving the crisis after it's a problem.

Many people in this fandom seem to view Troi less than favourably. I won't speak to any reasons other than frequent mentions of her generally not being very useful.

I know a lot of you will be prompted to disagree that this is the case, but we can only speak from personal experience and this is the point of view I'm coming from so if all you're going to say is ""what? everyone I know loves her"", I hear you, save your effort.

I'm rewatching TNG and it's occurred to me why this might be, even though in my opinion it is wrong. It seems like there's a key difference in how Troi is useful as opposed to the other characters around her.

For example, Data, Geordi and Crusher tend to chew on a problem and propose or create actionable solutions to solve the main crisis.

Picard likes to have a last-minute revelation and think or talk his way out of a problem, while Riker and Worf tend to be more action-oriented and reactive in their heroics. All these characters often get their moments in a very memorabel, climactic way.

I don't think it can be overstated how useful Troi is, just in a way more subtle and totally different way. Her moments aren't as easy to remember, but they are way more frequent than most other characters.

Sure, sometimes she doesn't have very much to offer when asked her opinion (I won't get into how that is also useful sometimes) but it's worth noting that she is indeed repeatedly asked.

Often she has helpful insight, which may seem obvious points to us based on storytelling clues but are at least helpful in confirming what Picard may be guessing at.

But more frequently, she is actively useful in bringing forth new information the crew wouldn't have otherwise, including sensing certain things on an entirely imperceptible level to the rest of them. They'd be screwed without her in many cases.

Her abilities can't be overlooked. I don't need to walk anyone through why her abilities are useful in theory, any level of mind reading is obviously an asset. But I've never seen anyone go out of their way to point out how finely tuned her senses are, sometimes she is very specific in her descriptions (even though the meme is that she is always vague, or else just stating the obvious).

Not only are they specific, they're also broad and powerful. She can feel and sense things thousands of kilometers away, from thousands of individual complex entities at a time. On top of everyone in the ship around her. That would take incredible strength to handle and would make her an incredibly useful asset especially in her job which, by the way, is also a very necessary thing to have on a ship out in space that long even if it were a position filled by a human.

This won't be news to most of you but I know some people need to hear it.",In defense of Troi
1,"As is well known at this point, the premise of Breaking Bad was simple: turn Mr. Chips into Scarface. But how it would be done or what would happen along the way wasn't predetermined. Instead, the writers wrote organically. As described in countless behind-the-scenes podcasts and interviews, in determining how to create the story, the writers simply asked themselves episode to episode, ""Where's a character's head at?"" and ""What happens next?"" The television equivalent of one-step-at-a-time. This way, character choices and plot moves seem plausible, and the characters gain depth.
Contrast this with Star Trek: Picard, which seems to have been created with a checkbox approach. We need to get them from here to here, so what can we come up with to make that happen? Or we want to establish this about this character, so what can we come up with to show that? Check, check, check. This approach is what leads to moments not feeling earned. This is how you end up with plot holes. This is how you end up with thinly-written characters, poor pacing, and coincidences that are too hard to believe. I am certain that 80% of the problems that people have with this show are the casualties of this writing approach. The most blatant example to me is Elnor. He's fine as a character, but there's no reason he needs to be on the crew other than the writers decided it would be cool to have someone like him round out the team. And what you end up with is this huge detour to pick him up, some maudlin backstory to establish their relationship, and some forced drama about whether Elnor will go with him or not. Another example is the writers wanting to establish that Raffi has some past demons to contend with. Insert dramatic scene with son. Check.
If you're going to revolve a whole television series around a character, and declare upfront that it's meant to be a slower, character-driven show, then the writing approach should match. As it is right now, it's like the show is constructed by patchwork, and I can feel and see every seam. ",Recommendation to Picard's showrunners: adopt Breaking Bad's approach to writing.
1,"I'm currently rewatching DS9 and have just had the finale to the Marquis saga.


I realized that the way the Federation handle the Marquis is very familiar, because it's exactly how the Fedration handle the Synth ban. 

In my opinion, the Federation has been on this path for a long time. The cracks were there even in DS9. And all this makes me appreciate Picard that much more.
Some might think it's a cash grab but I disagree. It actually takes the story forward in the same way it was already going, and I can't wait to see where they go with it.

1,"I have been a life long Trekker, but I also have a very VERY low tolerance for graphic violence. I stopped watching Discovery after an episode in S1 when some Klingons slit open some throats right there on screen. I understand some people enjoy this type of content, so please respect that I don't, and please understand when I say low tolerance I mean LOW tolerance. Bloody gun violence is about as much as I can tolerate, and I'm talking like mild aftermath stuff, not close range bullet to the head stuff.  


So when in Episode 4 of Picard there was a SUPER GRAPHIC decapitation, I nearly puked, and I said well, that's it. Despite my life long love for this character I'm going to have to stop watching.  


And now I'm, you know, trapped in my house on quarantine and I really want to go back and try to watch.  


Can anyone tell me - how graphic does the violence get in episodes after that one? I didn't even finish that one to be perfectly frank. Please remember my low tolerance. Do you think I could take it?

1,"Longtime ST fan and reddit/startrek lurker, created this acct just to post this. Loved Picard from beginning to end. Watched every ep multiple times:

\-Picard and Data scenes bookending the season were amazing

\-Picard and Data heartfelt goodbye -  so grateful as a fan to have this scene

\-Nepenthe was a brilliant updating of ""Family"" and is already one of my all time fav Star Trek eps. The Rikers are now the safe place Picard comes home to. The warmth and love between the TNG characters was everything I could have wanted, an anti-All Good Things future.  Writing/acting of Riker/Troi was perfect.

\-Seven! Hugh! Hugh and Picard's reunion was such an unexpected moment in this series and so satisfying

\-Rios, Raffi, Zhaban, and Laris are great new characters

\-Patrick Stewart is one of the great actors of our time and was suburb. His interpretation of Picard at this stage of his life is genius. Bitter about how Starfleet ended for him, yet relaxed after years of being away from the pressures of command.

\-Picard learned to love kids over time - wonderful! Elnor episode and relationship were great, cant wait to see more

\-Old Picard mad at himself and busting into the Romulan bar and starting shit

\-CAPTAIN PICARD DAY BANNER

1,"This was like 15 years ago or so, back on early youtube. A couple of friends made this home movie looking series (maybe like three or four vids in total) with a Star Trek playset and some action figures. All I remember is the crew was a bunch of fuckups who'd get people killed due to negligence and Picard was a deranged psychopath -think Captain Murphy from Sealab- and would do shit like ride around in a wheelchair because he was lazy hypochondriac, and installed an absurd number of railings and ramps all over the bridge that got in everyone's way and caused people to actually get hurt.

It wasn't stop-motion or anything fancy. These guys would just grab the toys and wave them around as if they were playing, but you never saw anything more than their hands, and the situations they came up with were like something out of It's Always Sunny, except way more fucked up.

Voyager missed the boat largely on being too safe trek with not too many fresh ideas despite being across the galaxy with all new species. I feel like if Star Trek creators ever ""respected"" the old material the way the fanbase wants them to, everything would still be TOS, most of the stuff the modern fanbase adores wouldn't exist, and the franchise would be deader than doornails.

1,"Let me start off by saying that I am very grateful that we are getting new Star Trek shows for the first time in over a decade, however, I can’t help but feel that the producers are prioritizing the amount of new series they put out rather than the quality of those shows. I just finished Picard and it’s pretty obvious at many times throughout the show (probably one of the most anticipated Trek series ever) that it was quite rushed and not given NEARLY the budget it deserved. (Did they prioritize the budget for Discovery?? If so, that was a mistake…) And now with all the other series announced (that nobody asked for or really cares about.) I can’t help but think that the producers/CBS are intentionally or unintentionally diluting the quality of Star Trek so they can pump out all these extra series.

I think that Star Trek should be run by producers who truly care and understand the show and are fans themselves. They should choose one or two stories that audiences would love best and invest their budget and time there. I grew up with Trek and it’s my favorite show(s), and I’m worried that I’m not gonna like where this is going.

1,"Just in case you don't know: Mass Effect is a series of computer/console games. The Storyline is, that every 50k years an outergalactic species arrives and kills all species with a certain level of technology. These aliens are called ""The Reaper"".

During the first three games we, as gamer, found out about the threat, about the background of the reason why the reaper do what they do and even meet someone who witnessed the last ""purge"" (stasis is a hell of a tech). Long story short: Organics built tech, tech became consious, both fight, organics loose, tech hibernates for 50k to kill everything that could be a threat... repeat.

At the end of the third game  we face 3 different endings:

1. Destroy the reapers and ALL (!) synthetic life, even the friendly one
2. the hero(ess) takes control over the reapers, in exchange for sacrificing his/her body. The hero becomes an AI himself/herself and the reapers become ""slaves""
3. Synthesis of organic and synthetic life forms. All lifeforms (organic and synth) merge and form new lifeforms (but they keep the apperiance). In fact, Humans e.g. end up as creatures like Picard is at the end of Season 1.

1,"I just wanted to say that, as a UK viewer, i've had to go to some lengths to avoid spoilers for ST:Picard. Every Thursday I had to remind myself to unsbscribe from r/startrek and r/DaystromInstitute, and I had a long list of muted words on Twitter: ""#STPicard"", ""Romulan"", ""Soji"", etc etc. Unbelievably I was 100% successful, and barring the trailers and the next time segment on the Ready Room I came to each episode entirely fresh and unspoiled.

Then, this week, Jonathan Frakes posted to Twitter a photo of himself in a captain's chair, in the sweet new Starfleet uniform, with the caption ""Social distancing"" - neither of which were, obviously, among my muted words. I don't even follow Frakes but there he was in my timeline.

And you know what? It's fine. Not because it was a fairly predictable plot development (although it was), but because somehow Jonathan ""no fucks given"" Frakes carelessly dropping plot spoilers has become such a tradition that it would almost be disappointing to me if he didn't.

1,"I think I've got a different take on Picard... and it relates back to Discovery and the Kelvin timeline.

I went in to Picard with HIGH hopes, and was fully let down, but I couldn't identify why. I think all new generation of ST content has become ""Star Wars"" more than ""Star Trek"". Many people argue, ""Hey old man, the new ST is great! It makes it more accessible to new fans! Just be happy to grow the base!""

I'm actually **happy** there are people who enjoy the new content. That's nice! But old ST was in a totally different genre than Star Wars. To grossly oversimplify, Star Wars is an underdog story. (Bear with me... please forget what you've heard about ""the hero's journey"" which I argue is just an epic version of the underdog story). When you look at Star Wars... or Fast-and-Furious... or Avengers... it's all about being the underdog. The protagonist(s) fight against an impossible foe and then rise above all obstacles overcome the big-evil. It's a great conceit. It's why the new ST is so accessible for new fans. Who doesn't love a good underdog story?

But that's not classic ST. TOS crew were explorers... and they had confidence. They were part of the noble Federation. They may be isolated, and get into trouble because they were on the frontier, but BEHIND THEM was the full weight (and moral fortitude) of the Federation. The story basically set itself up as... ""okay, we've solved all those other basic conflicts in life. There's no push for basic survival, or wealth, or power, or resources. Now we focus on exploring what's-out-there, and at the same time we explore what-it-means-to-be-human, what-we-can-aspire-to-be."" (Exploring both inner and outer space).

So why the new ST iterations are disappointing *for me* is that I went in with different expectations. It'd be like walking into the next Fast And The Furious and getting a light-hearted rom-com. Or going to see the next Avengers movie and getting a teen coming-of-age-story. Even if the rom-com F&amp;F was faaaaantastic, I'd wager the folks that walked in there expecting high-octane action would be let down.

So in conclusion, I'm **happy** that new fans can get a story line they find exciting and engaging while watching Disco, Picard, or Kelvin. I'm happy there's people that can get to know Kirk, Picard and Burnham^(\*ahem\*), and see them as heroes. I wouldn't want to take that away from anyone. I personally don't find Star Wars all that engaging, but look at the fan base! I'm stoked all those folks can find so much joy in the SW saga. I just hope at some point there will be more content (Star Trek or otherwise) that focuses on the human element of exploration, and doesn't feel the need to make another underdog story.",Picard is not my Star Trek (and that's okay)

I remember watching one of the Kelvin Timeline films (I honestly can't remember which) and there was a throw away line about some little adventure that they went on where they didn't blow up the Enterprise and I realized how much I wanted to see that. That cast also had great potential, but for me the fun of trek is seeing the dynamics of these great people being people and working together to do the thing because it was right, not necessarily because the fate of the universe hung in the balance.

1,"Am I the only one who finds that the ships on 'Picard' and 'Discovery' look really different from the Trek designs in the TNG/DS9/VOY era?

The ship designs in TNG era by Andrew Probert, Greg Jein, Rick Sternbach were in my opinion elegant, weighty and memorable. Think of the designs for the Enterprise-D Galaxy-class, Romulan D'deridex, Klingon Vor'cha. They were instantly memorable, beautiful to look at from every angle.

And you could trace each ships' design language back to the classic era Star Trek ships - the Vor'cha class was an evolution of the iconic K't'inga class from The Motion Picture and TOS tv show. The Galaxy class and (its contemporary Starfleet ships) were an evolution from the TOS Constitution class, adopting the graceful curves of the movie-era Excelsior, Miranda and Oberth classes. Even the D'deridex took the TOS 'bird' motif and made it into a literal 'Bird-of-Prey' personified.

Throughout the TNG-DS9-VOY-ENT history, Star Trek has always followed and honored a consistent design language. You can see this rule followed in the rest of the lesser seen ships - the Nebula-class science ships, Akira-class battleships, the Olympic-class (Pasteur) medical ships, the Klingon Negh'var ships and even the runabouts and various shuttlecrafts that launched from the Ent-D and Voyager shuttlebays.

For a show that is happy to build on / make money off of us fans' (enormous) goodwill from the Star Trek canon, the new VFX / Starship design team seems perfectly content to piss on Star Trek's rich design history, and come up uglier and more forgettable designs. I got my first taste of this with Discovery, when the Federation and Klingon ships were a bunch of clashing colors, all-too-busy design details that belonged more in a Michael Bay Transformer robot travesty, than on any recognizable Star Trek.

I had hoped that Picard would turn the tide, and bring us a long-awaited return to the TNG-design language, but the ship designs for the La Sirena, Riker's 200 copy-pasted fleet, and to a lesser extent the Zhat Vash's Romulan fleet all had forgettable designs that made me think they were made quickly, digitally, in a mercenary fashion. They did not seem crafted lovingly by their sculptors from hand, as I'm sure Probert, Sternbach and Jein had to, in the 80s and 90s. Many in our subreddit pointed out that Riker's fleet looked like a poor digital kitbash of Star Trek Online ships, and I have to agree.

Every time I see ships in 'Discovery' or 'Picard', I have to wince a little at the poor, bland, or messy designs and try to paint over it with better designs in my head. Surely the shuttlecraft in 2399 flying over the Golden Gate Bridge cannot look worse than the ones in TNG S2-S7? And surely they don't have to sport bright red spots of paint that make them look like off-brand imitations of the real thing? This reminds me of how the J.J. Abrams TIE Fighters added unnecessary spots streaks of paint, making them worse than the iconic TIE Fighters of the original SW trilogy.

Without an explanation for the regressions in design, I'm forced to conclude that either Star Trek's new batch of VFX people are incompetent ship designers, or they have little to no respect for the Star Trek history and ships that became before, and are determined to force in their own, original lesser stamps on the franchise.

And speaking of VFX, how is it that hand phasers in 'Picard' have reverted to bullet-style pulses? Is it because assault rifles are in vogue in today's world, so 2399 uses pulse weapons too?

And in the few moments we see traditional 'sustained' phaser beams used in starship battles on 'Picard', they sound tinnier/wimpier than the phaser sounds from the TNG-VOY era. In addition to losing VFX language, did the 'Picard' team lose the sound .wav files from the TNG era too, or did they think their new sound effects were superior?

It's all very baffling, and these poor design choices gnaw at me during my watches of 'Picard' and 'Discovery'. When Wil Wheaton interviews the VFX designer for 'Picard' and presumably 'Discovery', who seems rather proud of his messy VFX work, I find myself actively hating on that person, and wishing I could punch them in the face and give them a wake up call.

I don't believe that CBS skimped on their budget to make the ships beautiful. The production values on both 'Discovery' and 'Picard' seem movie-quality. It seems like no expense was spared. And the big piles of cash Netflix and Amazon Prime forked over for exclusive global streaming rights surely would have paid for a good VFX team.

I don't want to dump on the VFX team too much. I do think the holographic controls used in 2399 Starfleet are a good update to the starship consoles we saw on TNG-DS9-VOY. And Rios/Cristobal manages to make those controls look cool while piloting the La Sirena.",Starship designs and VFX on 'Picard' and 'Discovery'
1,"I’m a huge Ned Gen fan and I think I would really enjoy watching either/both VOY and DS9. However I find it really hard to get into new shows. The way my partner got me into watching TNG was by showing me a few of the coolest episodes. This way I knew I was in for a great adventure and I was willing to go through season 1-2 to get to the stuff. 

Im hoping you all can do the same thing for me with these other series. 

Tell me an awesome episode or 2 from these two series that will get me excited to get into it.",Suggest me an episode to get me excited about watching either VOY or DS9
1,"because Patrick Stewart sees something great in the show's potential. He believed in it enough to bring back his character after twenty years. I would say I see that potential in a lot of the cast. Like others have said, I would totally watch a show starring Rios. I also know the show has a finite end, so that gives me some hope.

What's frustrating is the writing, which I know is a big deterrent for a lot of folks. It's obvious to me that the writers are trying to find their footing in the vast Star Trek universe and had bumps along the road. I also think the show would have been much better if it wasn't 10 episodes, and was the traditional 20-22 per season because the pacing would have made more sense. However, given the budget of the show it doesn't seem like that was realistic. 

And at the end of the day, how many of us sat through the first seasons of TNG? Voyager? DS9? All the first seasons of those series were hard to watch for me. I genuinely believe season 2 will be better and hopefully they'll look over the scripts. It would be great if they brought in some of the writers from DS9 too. Just my two cents.",The reason I keep watching Picard is...
1,"Data’s life

I’m not sure if all would agree but the way data chose to die seemed a bit premature. I’m not sure but by the time of nemesis we don’t know how much and how long data was able to experience humanity with his emotion chip. So whatever Maddox put together to keep data alive doesn’t necessarily mean he was experiencing humanity. Am I missing something? 
I feel like he had so much more to experience, especially in such a big galaxy and rich universe with so much to learn. Data character had so many experiences waiting for him I feel....",Data’s lifespan
1,"To be blunt I didn't like Picard very much. I went in with high hopes that were killed off after the first episode. Remembrance was like a new spin on a favorite comfort food. There was enough nostolgia to scratch that itch and enough newness that made it feel different to TNG. Episodes 1-3 were mostly pleasant and then for me it fell off a cliff, with each coming episode a rock hitting me on the way down. 

If it wasnt for for the old cast and crew of TNG and VOY I wouldn't even have watched the rest of the season. None of the new characters had time to breath and develop. Agnes was forgettable. Rios was just another hot headed Latino stereotype ala Po in the Star Wars sequels. Raffi downright creeped me the hell out for some reason. I found her switching from drunken junkie to mother figure (while well acted and would totally work in something like Moonlight) out of place and jarring in this show. Seven I felt was reduced down into kick-ass token LGBT character who for some reason without any development or explanation is hooking up with Raffi? 

And finally there is the man himself Picard who is a broken down husk of himself. The man who was assimilated by the Borg, lived a lifetime in 20 seconds, and saved the Galaxy from certain doom numerous times now is told to fuck off at every chance and is berated in front of the entire galaxy on the evening news. Most of the time Picard in this new series took a backseat turning into a secondary character on his own damn show. The only times when I began to become slightly engaged with his character was when there were TNG call backs and in the finale when he took command of La Sirena (which made me smile).

I get it that all of the characters are suffering through some sort of trauma and the message of how we as individuals and as a society can become cold and distant after trauma is utterly brilliant. It's far better than TNG's Troi rape of the week and move on. But the format of ten episodes completely kills any chances of meaningful character interaction. It's structure is go go go and two minutes of heavy crying. The show didn't feel contemplative like it was advertised, it was a two hour blockbuster movie with eight hours tacked on to blow the special effects budget. Not once did I feel that the main cast was a crew, everyone felt like asshole grifters coming together for a paycheck from the old man. When Picard was dying all I could keep thinking was ""please no, not here with these people!"".

Compare that to Discovery which I didn't like that much either for reasons already well known but had it's moments even in the first episode of season 1.  It was apparent that the crew of the Shenzhou were a family and Michael betrayed that trust to her crew and the federation as a whole. Throughout season 1 she works to regain the trust of her family in both Saru and the federation.  Season 1 also had a great bottle episode ""Magic to make the sanest man go mad"" and the other away mission episode with the sentient resonance plants. Season two worked on that Bond between the crew with scenes like the auto antonym game between Lionel and Reno. Or even the humble brag Michael messaged to Tilly regarding her command test scores. Hopefully season three continues building on that good foundation.

Call me stuck in the past but Star Trek really works when the crew is a family. What made TOS so unique to other Scifi is that the Enterprise was not only a spaceship but it was a home and the crew was a family. Without that Trinity or ensemble of characters it isn't Trek it's just Scifi with trek looking ships.",[Spoilers] St:Pic is making me like Discovery more
1,"* Raffi/Stephen Franklin: The trusted coworker that pushes themselves too hard and ends up falling into drug use. Has a troubled past with family.

* Elnor/Marcus Cole: A fantasy character out of place in a scifi world.
* Dahj/Talia Winters: Exits their series in an event that demonstrates how evil the bad guys are. Both have hidden personalities awoken.

* Data/Delenn: Mcguffin. Comes from a group that all looks alike. Undergoes changes to become more human. Main protagonist is in love them.

Both series' plot involves the government acting xenophobic and selfish. Both series have a minority group trying to save themselves. Both series have an unstoppable evil that can wipe out the galaxy on the verge of being awoken. Both series have a large artificial structure that starts off as a neutral place for evil and good characters to interact. This structure is attacked multiple times and is eventually destroyed.

1,"This is not a ""Picard sucked!"" post. The writers had some really good fundamental ideas, and excellent plot points. Truly. 

But the way they handled the Romulans was an atrocity. 

Throughout the entire show they basically painted them as the bad guys. The Romulan assassin chick, Narissa, became a 2 dimensional psychopath who just wanted to fuck her brother and kill people. Cmdr Oh was an evil interloper who penetrated Star Fleet command. Etc. 

Here is the thing....***they were fucking right!!*** 

The Synths really did have an ancient hook up that would allow them to ***destroy all life in the galaxy***! Shouldn't they maybe get a little credit for that? Like isn't that a threat you would like to be aware of and maybe take guard against? Possibly? 

But instead in the end Riker bullied Oh into leaving, Oh just sort of shrugs her shoulders and retreats, and Riker says he will escort them back as if they were naughty children who can't be trusted or something. What the hell? 

In the very least the Romulans should have stood their ground and gotten some kind of guarantee that the call button for Cthulhu would be permanently and irreversibly destroyed forever. But no, not even that. 

And the Star Fleet just says ""Oh you came a hairs breadth away form destroying all life in the Galaxy? Cool, we will then rescind our ban on synths"" 

I'm sorry....WHAT??? 

Geez, give the Romulans credit where credit is due. The writers really fucked that part up.","The more I think about it, the more annoyed I get at how PIC treated the Romulans. They absolutely did them dirty!"
1,"Star Trek Picard questions.
One of my first questions was why the hackable budget androids at Utopia Planitia, but that was sort of answered. They were planted there on purpose by Commodore Oh.  
  
In episode 4, Absolute Candor, they go to Vashti. How the F does this poor planet afford plantary shield and defense platform? I don't recall any other planet in Star Trek with a plantary shield. Is this now standard at the dawn of the 25th century?  

Agnes Jurati murdered Bruce Maddox and everyone knows it. By the end of the season every act like all's forgiven or something.  

Near the end of the last episode we see Picard's death scene witnessed by most of the crew. They all weep, but when he comes back onto the ship no one reacts. It's as if nothing happened.  

With Picard's ressurection it's now cannow that in the Star Trek universe there exists technology to ressurect people. They also made synth body expiration optional. What implications does this have on the future of Star Trek?  

It was never explained why the Zhat Vash syths are the harbigers of doom. Why is that vision they get so convincing? Agnes, a scientist, was so convinced by the vision that Oh gave her that she lost all moral judgement? WTF?!?!",Unanswered questions about Star Trek Picard

Heck a show featuring a re-instated Captain Rios would be just fine by me.",I REEALLY Want a starfleet-centric show in the era of Star Trek: Picard.
1,"This is a complaint I have had for quite a long time and in different shows. Just some examples from Discovery:  the total disregard towards the established Klingon design, culture and technology. The infamous 18AU distance starbase. The impact of the spore drive. The fact that the spore drive is not even hinted at in existing canon. 

More recently from Picard's last episode: The needless inflation in ships (four romulan ships would have sufficed for the same story). The fact that certain technologies found on that planet are seemingly limitless (the repair Gizmo, the golem, the transmitter). Leaving the Borg cube completely unused and irrelevant for the story. 

I think the worst is that apparently no one is interested in sustainable story telling. How could the ship ever be damaged in season 2? Just pull out the Gizmo. How many synthetic lifeforms will there be after one more year? Where is their limit? Who will try to open such a portal next?

And all that would have been easy to reconcile. The transmitter could have been dependent on some exotic Borg tech. The synths could have been built using some ancient but limited artifacts from that planet. New stories and drama would arise quasi automatically.

1,"I strangely wanted to record this and I'm not sure why, but I thought if anybody you people might appreciate this because like the UFP you guys are generally warm and inviting types.

I dream often about the Enterprise crew, did as a teen as well and like many things in my dreams star trek and its various characters have been symbols. I don't often understand the symbolism nor why various people, places, and things are inserted into those dreams but I've come to learn that the high school/college setting that pops up often is about releasing my anxiety. I often have to complete some task that is nonsensical and inevitably dream confusion sets in making the task impossible.

Tonight was one of those times and I spent my dream attempting to construct some sort of home made Pog set from construction paper, scissors, and string, and as usual my ""Assignment"" was very late and needed rushing along before some ominous due date. Now cue Picard, Troi, and I believe Crusher who sit in and chat, joke around and generally make my anxiety ridden task a little easier. As I said before I know the purpose of the dream is to release the anxiety of the day, but I have to admit it was fun that the Enterprise crew was there to help me along a bit if only in my dreams.

Its a stressful time for a lot of us, COVID19 has put me out of work and as I'm part of the supply chain for the hotel industry I am likely out for a long time if not for good. We prepared fortunately enough,  but we are defiantly up in the air like so many others right now. Fortunately our dreams are there to help us process our anxiety and stress.

1,"As part of my quarantine Star Trek-mega binge, I finally got around to watching ENT. I remember being a teen way back in 2001 when the ads for the show came on TV, and I was totally turned off by the Vulcan Barbie sexualization (which I remember they pushed \*hard\*) and also that it was set in the distant past of the Star Trek universe. I just wasn't into that. I felt like Star Trek should always be going forward, into the future, not back into the past.

If I had known that so much of the show would be Vulcan politicking, Andorians, human supremacists, etc., I might have given it a chance. So far those arcs are definitely the best stuff on the show, and I enjoy the chance to see more of those cultures and their history. My boyfriend, who was watching the show with me, made a comment about how ""dour"" everyone was. I don't think the crew is actually dour, but they are generally pretty serious and straightforward -- none of them display any signs of having irascible, stubborn, hotheaded, or confrontational personalities. There's no Dr. McCoy, Miles O'Brien, Kira, or Seven of Nine on this show. Not even a Lon Suder. Trip kind of comes the closest, but he'd be the most neutral character on any other Star Trek show. I think that's why the episodes with Shran stand out -- he seems so firey in comparison with Archer.

I will say this, I teared up at the end of the episode when Trip and T'Pol's baby died. When we see T'Pol holding her mother's IDIC with grief in her eyes, and Trip approaches her talking about the funeral in his voice that just says he's devastated... that was some good acting and genuinely sad.",Finally watching ENT for the first time

It would have tied back to them apparently having some vague aspect of his memories already, and allow Data to save the day one final time from beyond the grave.",The ending I expected... (spoilers)
1,"Spoilers ahead! 

I absolutely LOVED everything about Picard with only a few issues. I really liked in Episode 1 we almost immediately got answers to some major questions. Mostly about the Romulan Sun going supernova, the attempted rescue operation of the Romulans, and the Synth attack on Mars. 

And as the show progresses, we still get little bits of information about things but nothing to in-depth. All of which is understandable so not to stray from the story line to far. 

That being said, I desperately want to know the overall status of so many more things! What’s up with the entire Borg collective? Obviously they are still out and about but are they significantly weaker after the blow Voyager gave to them. 

Also? What is the status of the Klingon Empire? They were weakened pretty significantly after the Dominion War, but what was their reaction to the Federation wanting to save the Romulan society? 

And on the note of the Dominion War, what’s the status of the Cardassians? Did Starfleet occupy them and help rebuild them so they could join the Federation? Is Bajor part of the Federation? Are ships allowed into the Gamma Quadrant? And what about the Dominion itself? Have they changed at all after Odo joined the Great Link? 


Again! I absolutely LOVED Picard and can not wait for Season 2 but So many questions hopefully get Answered!

1,"I have been watching TNG for the first time and just finished the season 5 episode, I Borg. 

I was completely shocked when Picard proposed a plan to completely destroy the borg. I understand that he is traumatized by them, but it just seems so out of character for him to order genocide. I am glad he changed his mind, but I am still disturbed by his plan anyway.

I can understand arguments that totally destroying the borg could be the right thing to do, I'm not totally convinced one way or the other myself honestly, but Picard doesn't seem like a person who could even consider it to me. By not following through with his plan I guess he has the blood of all of the borgs victims afterward on his hands, but that is different.",Was Picard out of character in I Borg?
1,"I keep seeing people criticise Picard in particular, but also often Discovery for being ""Dark &amp; Gritty"" but DS9 went waaay darker than either have ever done - in ""In the pale moonlight"", the Federation kills a foreign dignitary in order to trick another power into a war &amp; in ""For the Uniform"" a Sisko renders a planet uninhabitable. These are often considered both some of the best Trek ever made. There's an actual attempted coup on Earth. Sisko literally loses his entire station to the bad guys during a full blown invasion of the Federation in a war that killed Billions, with the crew of the station regularly checking lusts to see if thieir friends &amp; family are still alive. What have Discovery or Picard done that's gone approached anywhere near those levels of dispair &amp; darkness? And bonus question for people who gave up on either series during their first seasons - how on earth did you make it through season 1 of any other Trek?!",Have people forgotten how dark DS9 was?
1,"Now I love Star Trek, I grew up on it. But it’s time to discuss the absolute absurdity of the plot of Star Trek Picard.

First of all, the Zhat Vash are boring and absurd, and the whole synth thing was boring and absurd and didn't make any bit of sense for the Romulans (or for any race, but least of all the Romulans who have shown no hint of such proclivities before and are known in previous serious to be an intensely curious race with cybernetics researchers of their own). It’s nonsensical. At least the Tal Shiar make sense. They're an intelligence agency and they have their propoganda machine and silence dissent and ostensibly do some actual protection from outside threats now and again.

But the Zhat Vash are... a secret society of clumsy Keystone Cops dedicated to making sure nobody researches Synths. Because they found some message in the desert. And of course as a super discreet top-flight secret society they have 218 warships and millions of members and a limitless budget to dump into making sure nobody researches Synths. Right, that all makes complete sense for the Romulans. Not like they have anything better to do with these limitless resources, like oh I don’t know, rebuild the homeworld they were stranded on, I guess.

And don't get me started on the Romulan that was so sad when she was assimilated, that it shut the Borg down. Because she was sad. I fell out. 

PLUS the rest of the plot could be solved with a simple tricorder scan. You're telling me that all the times Soji went through a transporter buffer or was scanned entering or leaving secure locations in the Artifact that they never deduced she was not quite human? Similar thing with Commodore Oh - are there not a ton of full Betazoids in Starfleet? Could they not sense her treachery? Vulcans and Romulans are very readable to Betazoids. Also, as she was Starfleet’s HEAD OF SECURITY, why didn’t Riker drag Oh’s ass back to Starfleet to face treason charges? You’d think they wouldn’t let that go right away. 

I also disagree with the really dark tone of Starfleet in this series. It's like in the 20 years between Nemesis and Picard, the Federation somehow did a 180 and became cynical and distrustful like the Romulans. The tone doesn't work for this show, and it doesn't work for Discovery, either. They're trying too hard to make them bland, dismal sci-fi like everything else, and Star Trek has NEVER been about that.

End rant. Lol",Picard’s Plot (SPOILERS)
1,"Cause really. I mean don't get me wrong. Will Riker in charge and in a center seat was nice. Though a minor nitpick, I think Will should of been atleast a Rear Admiral commanding that taskforce. But minor nitpick. 

But really. All that taskforce felt like was the same ship copy and pasted 200 times. Just a lazy way out. I mean the design was nice, a different take on the Odyssey class in STO. But really no other designs?

I mean you're telling me there are now no other designs in commission in Starfleet anymore. Guess the battle of Procyon 5 is out the window for canon.

I mean I'll give DSC it's due. Battle of the Binary Stars was rather meh, but atleast there they took the time to have multiple Starship designs.

I mean a bit more of moving the goalpost(yes I realize this) but imagine the battle in Sacrifice of Angel's if the Federation Fleet was the Defiant, then a Miranda class ship copy and pasted 500 times and no other ships. Would of been dull, and most of us Trek fans would of been like ""Really? That's it?!"" Or I'd like to think so.

I think Mr Chabon and crew could of and should of given us better than that in that regard.

1,"Things I liked.

1: *The dinner table scene with Picard and Soji.*

It’s diamond. Between given dialogue and Stewart’s performance *specifically in this scene* - that was the first time I really saw Picard - he ate sparingly and gave considered, crisp, deeply human responses. I thought that guy could get up from that table and handle things, even at seventy odd. Stewart gave me a stronger sense of Picard in reserve in that single scene than I felt in 90% of the run.

2: The dynamic between him and his Romulan house staff, and the fifty seven weapons they had secreted around the house. That was a lovely kick off scene.

3: The opening dream scene. God that got me so excited.

4: **Riker**. The moment Frakes appeared was about the first point I believed this was real. 
Turns out he’s an outstanding natural actor and he brought it like a hammer. Ditto Sirtis, but Frakes landing felt like an anchor.

5: The final fireside scene with Data. 

--------------------

Things I didn't like:

1: Most of the rest of the series.

2: The weird sudden truncated digressions into crew (are they the crew?) people’s children/ other concerns. Here and gone again. Also the plastic handling of the new ship crew, the directed tenor of the performances (I’m super drunk for this call!), 
the total, total rejection of “if it doesn’t further the plot, confront or aid the protagonist why are you doing it” rule. 
It’s a real rule ffs. It's almost unfair what was done to the supporting actors. They were left swinging in the wind.

3: Chabon literally parked this series for long minutes at a time in every given episode for reasons I’ll never understand. To be clear I love Chabon as a writer. The Yiddish Policeman's Union I adore... **But what in the Christ**.  

5: Almost all that final conceit Picard manoeuvre and all after. Please let me forget that entire actor ego trip. It nearly wrecked the careful place Picard has in the mythos. He dies three times with eight close ups saving everyone and had to be literally dragged offstage. The invested parties need to have a conversation with Stewart. He needs to be Picard. He'll be happier.","Things I liked about Picard, and things I didn't like. Wow on either end."

1,"Seven was never an action-girl. She was an astrophysicist with advanced intelligence. We haven't seen her use that at all this season.

Seven was also never a hard-drinking hardass. She physiologically couldn't tolerate alcohol (or synthahol) and, by the end of the show, spent her spare time playing music and games, singing, and cooking. She put on a hard front partially due to social anxiety, but in her holodeck fantasies, she was warm and feminine. It's not that she wasn't tough, but that's far from all she was.

Now, it's understandable that what happened to Icheb would make her cynical and increase her 'edge'. But why was she out there 'on the frontier' in the first place? Why wasn't she at the Daystrom Institute or somewhere similar?

The suddenly bi thing also bothers me a bit. I am a bi woman, and I don't like the trope that the cool/hardass girl is bi, cos being bi is 'cool'. It would be more okay if she always had been, but Seven always liked men and never showed any signs of liking women. Except in fanfiction, of course, which was dominated by slash fic about her. I feel like pairing her with women suddenly is caving to the fetishization of her character and of bisexuality in general.

Idk; I feel like Seven went from an insecure (in some ways) intellectual to an action girl, and this change hasn't really been acknowledged or sufficiently explained. I'm hoping they'll be exploring her backstory more next season and we'll get to see more of what actually made her special.",Seven has always been my favourite Trek character. But I kind of don't feel like Picard has been a very faithful interpretation [spoilers]
1,"I have several issues with the series overall, but one detail really saddened me. And that is the fact that Federation fleet consisted of just one class of ship. Whether it is because of the producer's laziness or for whatever other reason it just looked dull, and it was a missed opportunity to introduce something new and pay tribute to previous designs. A soverign or Defiant could still easily have been in service at that point and in my opinion it would have improved on the whole confronation. (a d'deridex or two on the romulan side wouldn't hurt either ;) )",What bums me out about Picard finale

I only recently discovered it due to the quarantine lockdown. I've been looking for new shows to check out.

I knew Seth MacFarlane was a Star trek fan. I remember catching his cameo on Enterprise.

This show feels more like trek than Picard does. The sets, the characters, the writing. It all just feels like classic trek. They even got the actress that played Cassidy Yates on DS9. 

It's almost like I found out there was new episodes of TNG that I never knew about.

Part of doing that well is the feel of the machine, the bond created when a user has felt the changes so many times he is working in synch with it. In this way even as device in a story it robs that awesome connection we feel when we say a pilot commune with his craft in a professional manner. That old knight and his steed, ship and his captain motif seems to fall a bit flatter. Is that just me? I know it’s a nitpick and I honestly liked Picard, not my favorite but I liked it.

1,"At first it felt promising, especially after Discovery, but the two are more alike than I think either of them would like to admit. I think the fundamental problem is; they spend so much time developing the plot that they leave no time to develop the characters. We’re supposed to care about Soji, but I feel like we barely know her.

Bring back the episodic format that makes Star Trek so iconic. This new format isn’t Star Trek, it’s just a drama set in the Star Trek universe with Star Trek themes dribbled throughout.

The beauty of the old format was that you got to know each of the characters slowly, over multiple episodes, where each episode developed a specific aspect of a single characters arc. It felt more immersive, like you were there and experiencing the journey with them, rather than just watching it unfold in front of you. The new format feels forced, laboured, and lacks any real energy.

Picard is in a duplicate synth body, does that mean that humans can now essentially live forever? Before your body expires just upload (or download?) your brain engrams into a new host.

Like a Data body that doesn't age and has mega-strength.

1,"*Picard has died several times in ST and come back. What are your plans for Season 2?*


Well I've always thought that bringing someone back to life once is cool but I really want to push the envelope and try to kill all the major characters at least six or seven times this season to really get that full effect. We've got elaborate yet pointless deaths written in for everyone but the resurrection is always going to be the same: Tuvix.



*What do you say to people who say there's discontinuity and illogical leaps in the series?*


You know, ever since Season 7 when Worf becomes a dancing tree, it's been my philosophy to completely ignore what happened in previous episodes and just write whatever sounds the craziest. Those leaps are called ""artistic license"" and I hope I don't sound too modest when I say that I am this generation's Leonardo da Vinci played by John Rhys Davies.




*When the Romulans have their battles with the flowers and the illusion fleet, what were you thinking as a writer?*



I know that people don't like danger and change. So I've tried to craft the show to avoid anything that might create real consequences or suspense. I think it's worked really well. No one gets hurt or stays dead. And no big ship battles. Those are dumb. Space flowers and fake ships all the way.



*What will you do next?*


Well first we need to give Raffi a jetpack and a gremlin sidekick. Then we're going to finally explore Jurati's obsession with murder. She's going to kill a lot of people but we'll forget about that for the finale in which she'll kill all the same people she murdered during the season all over again, cry, and then slaughter them once more. Then she marries Wesley Crusher. Again.


*What happens in the finale?*

Let's just say there are two synth worlds this time, two beacons, two cubes, and two of all the characters. 

I've invented a new race called Frog People and they're really going to take Star Trek in a new direction. Frog People discover they are characters in Star Trek and they escape and then sue the studio for using their likenesses. I think it will really hit home with a lot of people.

This is our chance to really explore what Star Trek is all about.




*What's that?*


Stuff coming out of portals.



*What happened to Commodore Oh?*



She got a jetpack and a gremlin sidekick. I don't want to spoil anything but they die. And that Gremlin curses A LOT.


*Will there be any crossovers to other Star Trek series?*


Not to Star Trek no, but expect Badger and Skinny Pete to get involved in a distinctly Galaxy Quest type situation.



*Thanks for your time. Anything else you like to add?*

It's all about intimidation in the animal kingdom, right?  And the Commodore, or General, or whatever she was calling herself (&lt;3 Riker) sure was intimidated.  As the now-former head of Starfleet Security, she probably knew exactly what those new Starfleet ships were capable of, and knew that she should be afraid.

1,"The main plot was pretty good, but it felt like there was way more fan service than the creators lead us to believe. 

The first half of the series was incredibly slow and then the second half felt incredibly rushed. Any time we got a tease of action it either fizzled out in seconds or was skipped entirely. (""We need to escape"" cuts to them having successfully escaped without any issue)

I enjoyed the fan service elements, Picard and the plot but found the series to be quite boring but my partner, who has only been getting into Trek with Discovery has been frustrated by every episode.

The show had lots of good elements butbad editing and lazy writing really let the show down.

Show us characters do things instead of skipping over the action. There was a massive imbalance between speeches and philosophy and action that TNG did a lot better.

Don't build up to an action scene only to not bother with it! It leaves the viewers really dissatisfied when they expect action that you have told them to expect only to not deliver.

DEVELOP CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS! Rios and Juratti flirted a little then all over a sudden they're together. Seven and Rafi interacted for all of 15 seconds but it ends with them holding hands all loved up. WTF I would have loved to see that relationship blossom. 

I'm hoping the show will grow its beard and get better in season 2 but this season has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I can cope with a slower show focused on plot and philosophical elements - Picard is known for his speeches after all.

The show just hasn't delivered for me. Apologies for the rant I've literally just finished watching the finale and I'm trying to process my thoughts",Did anyone else find Picard quite disappointing?

JJ's first film was fun, but those films escaped me. *Discovery* is loved by some, but it's never resonated with me personally.

When *Picard* was announced, I suddenly found myself trying to track all the latest news and tidbits about the show before the premiere. The discussions and engagement online, be this sub or some engaging YouTube channels made for excellent *Trek* conversations and theories. The last 10 weeks have been a joy, and it's not something I thought I'd experience again like I did as a kid when my friends and I soaked up all things *Star Trek*.

1,"Long post ahead.

I sometimes am tempted to say that the criticisms levelled at Picard are just a vocal minority of old bitter people who wish that they still lived in the nineties. However that isn’t fair.

Beyond Star Trek, my other favourite show is Doctor Who. I’ve loved it since I was five years old. Then the latest era hit and it destroyed everything. To many I am the “vocal minority” in that fandom.
 Whenever I hear people say that, I feel that people are undercutting my own opinions. That my views aren’t as important because they are negative. That’s very Un Doctor who and VERY not Star Trek.

I love Picard and cannot see why people are SO critical towards it. It has flaws of course, but I genuinely feel that for the most part, people are just looking for something to hate. This Trek is modern, so for many people that equals bad.
 However, then I find myself considering how unfair that would be to others who disagree with me. How I would be invalidating others opinions, the same way mine has been in another fandom.

That being said there are some criticisms that just boggle my mind how idiotic they are that seem to come from wilfully ignoring the fact that  their criticisms have been explained away before, and the so-called “plot holes” have an actual logical reason. 

I’m unsure how to reconcile the two types of criticisms.

All I know is how I felt about the show.
Picard grew up with the people who watched TNG. It takes us exactly where we didn’t imagine we’d go, but somewhere it makes perfect sense to venture.
This series is the best first season any Trek show has ever done. It isn’t perfect, but comparing it to all the others, the only one that comes remotely close is the original series. 

I genuinely feel that when emotions calm down and people begin to get used to the idea, more and more will come around to the show. The same way they did in TNG. People forget that that show was pretty slated by the fans when it first came out, but was given the chance to endure and solidify into something better. 

Basically to me, Picard is genuinely one of the greatest seasons of Trek and I hope all involved don’t take too much negativity from the fandom. However, I also want to recognise the criticisms levelled at the show, even if I don’t agree with them.
To me, The show is a very well-written, well acted, well directed, and well scored one, that is a perfect addition to the Star Trek universe!",Pic: In Ten Years This Show Will Be A Classic
1,"So let me get this straight. There's a very tiny civilization on a planet that has the ability to open some sort of portal that would bring forth mechanical tentacles that would then ***destroy all biological life in the galaxy***. 

To make matters worse, this tiny civilization activated the beacon and the tentacle thing almost made it through, before one person changed their mind and closed it again, at the last second. 

Add to that, this very small civilization is made up of manufactured lifeforms, who with the threat of attack immediately decided to activate the beacon with very little debate. Which is like saying a bunch of robots needed hardly any convincing to try to ***destroy all life in the galaxy***. 

I totally see the Romulan's and Commander Oh's viewpoint here. I would in fact, have joined them. Not because I hate synthetics, but because the threat is too grave. And if I had to live with my conscience being burdened by the fact that I killed a bunch of robots, but ensured that ***all life in the galaxy*** would survive, I would bear that burden for my fellow galaxy inhabitants. 

So yes, I totally missed the point of Star Trek Picard. While he was arguing for synthetic rights and seeing the best in all life forms, no matter if they were manufactured or biological, I was yelling at the screen that he (and everyone else) is now taking a huge risk. 

What happens if the synthetics change their mind one day? What happens if just one synthetic changes their mind and activates the beacon? What happens if they do it behind the back of all the other honorable synthetics in the middle of the night or something? Starfleet, the Romulans, Klingons, etc. are all ok with this possibility?

I would have been the first person to fire on that planet, and probably slept soundly that night knowing I'm saving the galaxy.",I'm kinda with the Romulans on this one (PIC finale spoilers)
1,"Will  you people stop sh\*tting yourselves over Agnes?  She's no different from Vandermeer.  In fact, she has a far greater excuse for having killed.  Vandermeer was  a trained soldier who killed two innocent beings after merely being  ordered to do it, whereas she was a complete innocent who was compelled to kill one after being effectively tortured by an enemy agent.  Both attempted suicide afterwards, and one succeeded.

The only difference between them is that Agnes is a cute little blond who killed a middle-aged nerd.

Frankly, I'd love to see the parallels between her and Vandermeer drawn out more explicitly.  Developing a relationship between her and Rios more deeply based on the fact that she may have understood better than anyone else  on the ship what Vandermeer was feeling would be a great minor character arc in the second season.  It could be a great way to turn a creepy, dysfunctional hookup into an actual relationship and see what happens.  (This of course has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that I want to see Santiago Cabrera shirtless again, or that I like the idea of a skinny nerd landing him, honest.)

In a previous episode, Q taught Picard the importance of a near death experience to his life by allowing the captain to return to the past to prevent his best death experience and then letting him experience a future where he avoided the near death experience.

In the finale, he taught Picard the true meaning of exploration. I don't wish to spoil it to much, anymore than I already have.

Picard died, and they copied his mind into the android body, yay he's back again!

Except, is he?

I mean from a storytelling perspective and all that, yes, Picard is back and ready for more adventures.  But from a more philosophical standpoint, they copied his memories, his personality, but Picard himself still died.

Makes you wonder about the last scene with Data.  Was the younger image of Picard there to see him on his way just a comforting figment of Data's final dream?  Or was that *actually Picard* there to guide his friend on to the next frontier?","Picard, that ending, and who is what?"
1,"Many of the Picard showheads and Stewart himself have said they don't want the show to be like TNG, and I get and respect that.

I like new things too.

But I also feel like it cheapens TNG (7 seasons and 4 films) by not having all the original cast back at some point - together.  They were more than friends, they were ""family"" as Picard himself put it in Nemesis.

It feels like with season 1 of Picard that his family are split apart and don't talk at all. If something drove them apart, fans deserve to know.  I can't accept that they all just went their separate ways and they don't keep up with each other anymore.",I get that Stewart and Chabon don't want Picard to be TNG Part 2 but...
1,"*Prelude*  
So to begin, when I look back at my hopeful self saying Picard could be good its pretty clearly just nostalgia blindness. Thinking about it afterwards, there's no way to bring a new star trek series with old characters that wouldn't be at least jaring, with the differences in media today. I watched every episode as they came out and swifly went from 'It has potential' to 'When is something going to happen' to 'what is the point of this' to 'this is trash'.

*Conceptual Failings*  
Picard is a formula break. It shares none of the common thematic or tonal elements of the prior star trek works, as opposed to DS9 which subverted and recontextualised them. A darker trek can work, as DS9 shows, but only if it understands the underlying philosophy and can look at that from a different perspective, as opposed to something else entirely. Key example; all the prophecy nonsence. Its just a generic syfy programme with a veneer of star trek paint, taking elements from the Battlestar Galactica reboot and Mass Effect without the depth. The whole leave the romulans to thier fate thing is in stark oposition to the undiscovoured country; then core of the story has been told before and better. At that, the show seems padded. The first 3 episodes are on earth, and could easily be condensed into a single episode and there's an entire episode of fanservice. With a bit of editing, I honestly think it would work better as a film than a series. It seems that they had a core idea for the story but struggled to develop that, and just added side dishes.

*Character*  
Being presented as a character study of Picard, the main thing Picard needed to do well with was character. In TNG, Picard was a skilled diplomat and starfleet officer, a serious by-the-book sort of person, and a true believer in federation ideals. In Picard, he is only the latter. All depth regarding how he marries this idealism with his professionalism is gone. Another noteworthy mention is Seven. Its been two decades since we have seen this character, and when last we saw her she was on her way to being a reserved, but not unconfident, woman. I wouldn't expect no change; She'd probably go by Annika and be able to navigate social situations, if with a degree of discomfort. These changes were foreshadowed and coreographed in the latter seasons of Voyager. I cannot suspend by disbelief when Seven still goes by her Borg designation, has left her comfort zone, become a 'Ranger', began to drink and is now entirely confident around people, having abandoned the moral lessons imparted by Janeway. These two characters could have had some truly interesting interactions, but after draining Picard of all depth and dismissing Sevens arc in Voyager, they relegate this to one scene. Oh, and the new characters are similarly shallow and generally bad.  


*""""Lore""""*  
Star Trek lore is a big mess, hence the quotation marks. I think a bullet point list would be best;  
\- Why is the federation dominated by the Hawk lobby, when they were always presented as, at best, a sizeable minority in starfleet alone  
\- why is earth now terrible? what happened to paradise?   
\- Given that section 31 had the head of the Tal Shiar in its pocket, how did Oh slip under the radar?  
\- How did Oh, a romulan general, manage to hide her past in general  
\- The whole positronic neuron rubbish in general  
\- Rikers kids disease was dumb  
\- Are the androids entirely flesh and blood a la Fallout 4, or just fleshy shells a la terminator  
\- Why do the romulans have a secret society within thier secret police  
\- What is with all the swearing? Sisko commited war crimes and only went as far as damn  
\- What is with the vape 

*Wut I wunt*  
When can we get a truly episodic star trek series set post TNG to continue the story? Thats all I want; more star trek looking forwards. When is Kurtzman going to abandon the serialised model? I didn't work for Enterprise, its not working for discovery and I doubt it will work here. Give us episodes that focus on characters, allow them to develop. Star trek was always rooted in character, and the new trek tendancy to focus on one primary character (Burnham or Picard) hurts the shows badly. Not to mention, the attempt to vomit out a story shifts the focus away from any characters. Combining poor narative, poor character development, a central character, and a focus on the narative obviously doesn't work.

1,"Just got to the end of season 3. I'll try not to spoil anything in case anyone is doing the same as me in these trying times.

I've just done the last episode in season 3 where ""something"" happens to Picard and it ends on a cliff hanger and tonight I will be starting season 4. 

I can't believe how much I'm enjoying it and it seems to just be getting better and better. I really didn't think I would like it as much as I have and I find it nice that most episodes seem to have a beginning middle and end format but there is also a semi underlying plot.

It's very different to more modern series where it's all very involved and storylines take episodes or seasons to complete and I like the way Star Trek is doing it, it really makes for easy viewing.

Does anyone have a viewing order for the other series, I did look but there seemed to be a large variation in what to watch and when. I heard there is some overlap of a few of the series or something?",First time watching Star Trek and Tng season 3 was amazing.
1,"Hi everyone!

So... I REALLY like *some* aspects of the *Picard* series. In particular, I love how Romulan mythology is expressed by Narek to Raffi, Rios, and Elnor at the campfire.

I like how Narek reveals the extremism of Romulan culture because *Star Trek*, in particular *Deep Space Nine*, has always featured fictional cultures that are depicted as extremist ideologies.

It reminds me of Klingons with their pious worship of the most legendary warriors in their history. Also, Ferengi capitalism, and the Cardassian national-socialist-esque belief in cultural subjugation based upon a perceived ""natural"" superiority.

The secrecy and mystical wisdom that is sewn into the Romulan religion is particularly reminiscent of Bajoran prophecies, in that what they believe *might actually be true*. Nobody understands the wormhole aliens better than the Bajoran people, but that belief is encoded in a religious understanding of them as the 'Prophets'. To gain the Bajoran understanding of the wormhole aliens requires the ability to emotionally resonate with this religious understanding, as demonstrated by Sisko. Sisko's knowledge of the Prophets isn't incorrect, but at the same time it is not scientific. He's like a Prophet-whisperer, if you will, whispering into their ears to destroy fleets of Dominion ships, and making them do his washing and ironing.

Narek describes the foretelling of Armageddon with the knowledge and conviction of someone who has believed it completely since he was a child. His demonstration of piety stands in contrast to the newfound piety of the androids, who seemingly chance upon a similarly ancient deity-like ancestor of sorts, that immediately becomes god-like in their estimation.

Picard himself is an emissary of sorts as well... He's just a... Well, he's sort of the Western emissary. Or maybe he's a Western prophet? Picard *knows* that he is morally correct--and he is, philosophically speaking! According to the show, anyway. He struggles with individuals, but in terms of collective morality he's the king. It's not his fault he can't think about himself, he's the ideal collective thinker. He represents, according to the show, all of the best moral sides of a contemporary Western ideology. He doesn't strictly believe in welfare, but he believes in doing whatever it takes to ensure prosperity. He adores education and hard work, and abhors materialism and hedonism.

Anyway, a lot of it was complete rubbish, but I like how consistent it is with *Star Trek*, at least in that sense. I really liked the show.

1,"Is there a reason Oh didn't blow up the synths? They were going there to wipe them out prior to knowing anything about any beacon-portal. Why did she change her mind? We see they have a clear shot. Even if they didn't, surely they could have fought and *one* spaceship could get off a blast. Or at the very least try, given this was the Zhat Vash's entire purpose. 

As far as I can tell, she changed her mind because she felt threatened by Starfleet. But she's dedicated her entire life to this cause. She was willing to sacrifice billions of Romulans earlier. Why did she stop now? If it's for fear of intergalactic incident... well, surely she knew that was going to happen anyway, given that she revealed the head of Starfleet Intelligence was a Romulan plant.

1,"After all of the grand adventure why on earth did every single character death not serve the overarching story at all?

You could say Daj set everything into motion, but there was no need for her death. They could have gone on the same adventure with Daj and discovered Soji, pushing the whole synth story forward together. 

Echeb’s death was a disgrace to Star Trek. There was no point to it all than to motivate seven to kill a random gangster that I sure as hell did not care about at the end of the episode. And at the end of the season just for a “I never thought I’d do that again” line... seven was not put into a moment to question herself, she just Sparta kicked the psycho romulan to meet Palpatine at the bottom of the reactor pit!

And don’t even get me started on the apparent eyeball fetish the scriptwriters seem to have. Disgusting. 

And then there’s Hugh. And the whole damn Borg army while we are at it! His death carried zero weight to the rest of the story. There was nothing more than an “aww Hugh” and a boot at the end episode for all that!! Keeping him alive and actually servicing the Borg and XBs into the society on the android planet would have been a PHENOMINAL way to end their story. And the writers had to have known that with all the discussions, story threading, jams, and just straight up work they put into this. 

A character has to service a story otherwise it falls flat, and when a characters death fails to serve the progress story, that character was pointless. And I, just don’t like that.

And there’s a reason for that: It’s because myths are not made to sell action figures; myths are made to reflect the most difficult transitions we go through in life.”

* Rian Johnson

It finally clicked with me in a unique way why I have enjoyed Picard so much.  Like many of you, I spent many nights in front of the TV as a kid, watching the crew of the Enterprise explore new life and new civilizations, and I was completely engrossed. Like probably some of you, I saw Captain Picard as a bit of a father figure.  He was authoritative, wise, commanding, but also gentle and kind.  I was all of ten years old when TNG went off the air.

Since then, I've lived a lot of life - you probably have too.  Some successes, and more than a few failures.  A marriage, and then a divorce I didn't want.  An unexpected career change.  Wounds, and healing.  I'm in my mid-30s now, and mostly at peace with where I'm at.  But when I watch Picard, I watch him struggle with grief, loss, regret, and guilt, so many of the same things I've experienced.  And that's what's unique about Picard as a series and Star Trek as a franchise - now it's not just a series I grew up with, it's a series that has grown up with me.

To be sure, there are criticisms to be made, and some things I wish they had done differently.  But the emotional core of Picard as a character rings true.  There are so few stories that really stick with you from childhood to adulthood - Lord of the Rings is the only other one I can think of at this time.  Star Wars is fine, but it speaks to my childhood.  Harry Potter is fine, but it really only appeals to my inner adolescence.  Even Wheel of Time, a series which I love to death, is mostly about escapism for me.  There are so few stories that have resonated with me and kept me hooked as a child and as an adult, and I'm so glad now that Star Trek is one of them.",Star Trek is the only series that has grown up with me.
1,"One of my favourite moments from the season finale was when Rios and Raffi are on the La Sirena trying to fix the engines. It's quiet, with just the sound of the air recyclers. A rare moment on this show without music. There's the technobabble about the fused intermix reactor between two crew members. There's the brainstorming and problem solving, collaboration between crew, and the successful fix. A moment we've seen played out countless times on TNG between characters like Data and Geordi in engineering, when the only soundtrack was the hum of the ships engine. I would have liked more of these moments this season. To me, these quiet moments are great opportunities for meaningful conversation between characters. Maybe there isn't a lot of room for these sorts of scenes thirty years on, but, I, for one, would have liked to see more of these moments. Anyone feel the same way?",Star Trek: Picard — Data and Geordi in Engineering
1,"Arik Soong worked to create his own little group of augments, who were illegal under United Earth law. He initially helps the NX Enterprise to track them down (albeit very reluctantly), but switches sides to the augments once he finds them. When it becomes clear just how unstable and actually dangerous they are, he helps the Enterprise bring them down.

Altan Soong worked to create his own little group of androids, who were illegal under Federation law. He initially is hospitable to the La Sirena crew who show up, but switches sides once the synths decide on summoning the ancient synthetics. When it becomes clear just how misguided the synths were, and in particular how crooked their *de facto* leader was, he helps the La Sirena crew stop armageddon.

Not a complaint, I just thought this was interesting. I wonder how intentional it was, and how much input Brent Spiner had on it.",Altan Soong has a very similar arc to Arik Soong from ST: Enterprise
1,"After dying from his illness Picard was brought back to life by having his consciousness/memories transferred into an android body. We're also told the ban on synthetics has been lifted and the synth homeworld is now under the protection of the Federation.

So Is there anything stopping Dr. Soong from making immortal synthetic bodies for anyone who wants one? Or at least selling them to the wealthy if the writes still want to avoid making the Federation an absolute post-scarcity utopia? Because personally I think both options could be incredibly interesting to explore in season 2, and it'd really suck if this was just another revolutionary invention that just got ignored like so many other things in Star Trek. Especially given how they've decided to go the route of having each episode/season build off of the previous one like in Discovery.",[Star Trek Picard - Spoilers!] Question related to what happened to Picard in the last episode.
1,"This is a question that can be asked of pretty much any show now, but given the unique natures of Discovery and Picard, I think there is all the more reason to ask about them specifically.

First, what is the point of opening credits in the streaming age? Discovery and Picard are on CBS All Access only with the other shows on streaming platforms. Netflix allows you to just skip the intro all together, but CBS All Access won't let you, but you can fast forward. With shows exclusively streaming or being put on DVD, is there a need for opening credits anymore? What purpose do they serve in the streaming age when you can skip them? 

To me they are, at best, a waste of time, and, at worst, a spoiler within the show. Yeah I had no idea that Seven, Riker, or Data were going to show up in their respected episodes until I saw their names in the opening credits. Admittedly, this happened as far back as the TNG era, possibly TOS, but it was still a spoiler to put names upfront like that. 

Again I ask, why are they needed nowadays? Can we just skip opening credits all together and just save everyone's time and get right into the story?",Are opening credits still necessary?
1,"I'm thinking about how all the times Soji was talking about what it's like to question her reality and how her memories aren't her own, her life isn't her own, etc., it was the perfect set up for Picard to talk about his experience from *Inner Light*. Except instead, no, he just agrees that he can't possibly imagine what it's like.

And then talking about the consciousness transfer to a positronic body last episode I just couldn't help but think 'Haven't they already established this is possible in *The Schizoid Man*?', which then made it kind of obvious why they'd bring that up.

Did anyone else feel like there were moments in Picard where a character should have remembered something from an older episode?",Did anyone feel like there were 'gaps' when it came to linking Picard to TNG?
1,"Star Trek fandom has started to be divided since the JJ movies and things have gotten worse with Discovery and Picard. It used to be we could discuss our favourite shows, ships and episodes without being attacked for our opinions. Whenever i take a look at the Star Trek socials or even reddit, it now feels like a heated political discussion. Some people are really getting riled up, rather than having conversations about a shared interest.

As i will be doing a video-discussion on Picard S01 with my best friend, we happen to have opposing opinions (which i think will make for a more interesting video). 
To kind of give us a feel for things in the community, i have three questions:

1: What did you most like about Star Trek Picard or what was it that turned you off from it?

2: What has changed in Star Trek fandom so that a lot of people can't have a normal discussion anymore?

3: Who is at fault for the change in fan-climate?

1,"As a lifelong Trekkie and huge TNG fan, I went into this show with very high expectations. Sadly, they did not reach them for me.

My biggest issue with the entire series, aside from countless continuity errors, is that it doesn’t respect the things that Trek stands for.

Since TOS, the message was that the future was bright, and that there were always a peaceful solution to any problem.
Picard follows the trend that Discovery set in it’s glorification of violence and overall dark tone. I’m not saying that there should never been any blood spilt, but killing seems to be most characters (even the good guy’s) first choice.
This is displayed greatly in the episode where Seven, despite Picard’s requests, kills a woman in cold blood, while basically saying “there’s no hope left in the galaxy.” That’s where the show really lost me. Jeri Ryan herself said in an interview that Star Trek stood out among other sci-fi series because of its optimistic view. Trek, throughout its many iterations, was always about hope and spreading good messages. I could not find any good message in this entire series.

Star Trek Picard, and Discovery as well, have become generic sci-fi thrillers instead a distinct Star Trek series. From the cursing, to the gore, to the disrespect for established canon, this “New Trek” has really lost me. It feels to me like the people that made the series never watched Star Trek, but instead just googled “Captain Picard” and wrote the show based off of that.

I don’t want to sound like an angry fanboy saying “f*ck you Alex Kurtzman”, but that was my honest reaction after watching this finale. If anyone thinks I’m missing the point, then I would love to hear your interpretation of this show and it’s message: I really would. But until somebody can convince me otherwise, I’ll go back to watching good old TNG and trying to forget this whole thing ever happened.",General opinion of Star Trek: Picard
1,"Why did the Romulan anthropologist recognise Soji as ""the Destroyer""? We're told that story comes from history, which couldn't know her face. And certainly the admonition wouldn't have any idea what she looks like. So... there doesn't appear to be any explanation at all to me.

As far as I can tell, it was pure coincidence. The ravings of a mad woman that just so happened to be (in a manner of speaking) accurate. She just so happened to see Soji and randomly decide she was the Destroyer. How convenient.",[Spoilers] Is there any explanation for this PIC plothole?
1,"I have long wanted to see a post-Nemesis series that touched upon the statuses of the Borg &amp; Dominion, Federation presence in the Delta Quadrant, the time-traveling division of the Federation, and the next big internal or external threat. Picard did not disappoint, but IMO too much time was wasted on a brief Zhat Vash backstory, and a Romulan with an English accent ""pumping"" an android for information. It didn't make sense that a fleet of ships would need to be built on Mars to evacuate Romulus. Wouldn't there be enough ships in Strarfleet and the Romulan Empire to do that? The Borg cube was underutilized. The androids were a brief threat. The half-Romulan half-Vulcan Romulan officer who was somehow a Starfleet commodore was a lackluster reveal. Maybe the sunglasses was a giveaway that she was a villian. 

I'd like to see a (mini?) series that covers a much longer time frame. Maybe one long episode set every ten years with a lot of overlapping characters so we see how they contribute to some ongoing arc plus technological development and progress of things that are best seen over an extended period of time, i.e. a Starfleet officer rising through the ranks or first contact with a newly warp-capable civilization that becomes a major player.",Idea for a series. Includes spoilers from Picard.
1,"In the world of Star Trek, fantastical new technologies exist, but humans are pretty much the same as they are now physiologically and spaceflight basically entails traversing the galaxy inside a vessel designed to recreate the experience of living in a town with apartments, a school, a clinic, etc.  


I understand this keeps everything relatable for story telling purposes, but it seems to go deeper than that in areas where The Federation's philosophy mirrored Roddenberry's own philosophy on issues like genetic engineering, transhumanism and so on. See: Eugenics wars, the stigma Bashir lives with as a GMO human, the fearful portrayal of cyborgs even though Geordi is technically one. Just slightly though. One toe into the future, but no further, because then it becomes scary and weird.   


As an example, in Star Trek we see that even ignoring Data, the Enterprise itself has a tremendously sophisticated AI. We also see replicators and transporters capable of assembling atoms in very large volumes, very quickly (as in that Trek movie where they transport a whale). This has some obvious implications. With AI, replicators, antimatter power storage and warp drive, there's no longer any reason for large, manned space vessels.  


You might instead send a much smaller, fully automated vessel to a habitable world where it replicates cities ready to be populated, and then creates humans from recorded templates to populate those cities. If the goal is to colonize the galaxy with humans, this is the simpler, safer way to go about it.   


Weaponized applications of transporter tech were very briefly explored in Voyager, and the canon explanation that they don't work through force fields explains why that tech isn't commonly used in battle, but the other applications of transporters and replicators are never fully explored because it would make a mockery of the way the Federation explores and colonizes space.   


Why, for example, do starships not self-repair during battle? Basing our estimations of the rate at which transporter / replicator tech can assemble particles on the whale transport scene, it should be completely feasible for a starship under attack to nearly instantly repair mild to moderate phaser burns, up to non-critical photon torpedo strikes. Yet all we ever see is the computer erecting force fields at hull breaches to keep the atmosphere inside the ship.  


We kinda sorta see transporter / replicator tech employed defensively in the futuristic starship Janeway brings from the future to deal a finishing blow to the borg, but there is no clear reason why it's used to fabricate additional armor when it could simply be used to repair damage to the existing hull faster than additional damage can be inflicted, and it's unclear why that tech didn't already exist even prior to TNG. As soon as transporters could handle large volumes quickly, all starships should've been able to self-repair in real time.   


Lastly there's the spooky movie monster depiction of transhumanism in the form of the Borg. As mentioned earlier Geordi is himself a cyborg but the visor and associated implants correct a medical problem rather than enhancing him. The canonical explanation for why cybernetic or genetic enhancement is verboten under the federation is a sort of cartoonish notion that enhanced individuals would go mad with power and try to conquer the world/galaxy.   


This, I feel, stems from fear of the future. Or more precisely fear of change. I think Roddenberry wanted to tell stories about humans in space. But if you carry the technologies in Trek to their logical conclusion, you get humans that aren't quite human anymore, which is less relatable and likely a frightening, uncomfortable prospect to viewers.",Why was Roddenberry so afraid of the future?
1,"So I just watched the last episode of Picard, and I can honestly say that it was my favourite Star Trek series ever.
It blended old Trek with new Trek and took the story to exactly where I wanted to go.

I often think that the best types of endings are the ones that you can’t see coming, but once it happens you can’t imagine anything else, and while I suspected certain things would happen, it all came together magnificently.
This is exactly what I wanted to see without even knowing it!

As someone who isn’t the greatest fan of Picard the character (early days anyway) this series blew me away by its take of the flawed but ultimately heroic man. It gave me such an insight to his character, that I felt I never really got before. Again he’s old but new.

The characters are absolutely phenomenal and while I know some people have issues with Raffi and wished that the villain had more screen time (I actually agree on that one), they all were so perfectly written and acted and felt like they truly belonged in that universe.

I know there is a lot of hate and criticism, and while I know this show isn’t perfect, (Neither was the first season of TNG), it is such a welcome addition to the universe. It’s not afraid of doing it’s own thing, yet it respects what came before. 

This show was absolutely phenomenal. I can’t wait for a rewatch!",Pic: That was the greatest season ever!
1,"Every time I watch Star Trek the Motion Picture, two scenes in particular used to absolutely freak me out when I was a wee lad. First one was the transporter malfunction, where viewers are treated to the agonizing screams of people getting their molecules disassembled. The second was the first “probe” Vger sends to the Enterprise...that stalking beam of light that blasted both ship and crew with lightning...caused many a nightmare...I can’t be the only one who was scared shitless by that thing...",Scariest moments as a child from The Motion Picture....
1,"JUST A HEADS UP: SPOILERS FOR THE PICARD FINALE

After having Picard, Data, and Riker all in the same episode of television for the first time in 26 years I was wondering if Picard would ever have a full-on reunion of the Next Generation cast.

Now, I know Stewart see's this as his ""Logan"" so the Enterprise crew will never be mains on the show. However, I think it would be great if they had a 5-10 minute scene where the Enterprise crew just all get together for a dinner, social event or something like that. I think it would be a really great way to pay tribute to TNG and all the actors without over-shadowing the main storyline the Picard writers want to go with.

I think everyone can agree that Picard is at it's best when it brings in past Star Trek characters. It's highest rated episodes on IMDB are Episode 7 (with Riker &amp; Troi) and Episode 1 (with Data). Seven &amp; Hugh are also some of the best received characters on the show (they should really find a way to bring Hugh back!). Plus, a lot of what makes Soji interesting is her connection to Data.

So yeah, I think it would be nice if the show gave us a scene with the entire TNG cast together again. Especially since Picard saying he doesn't want to endanger them (like he did with Worf and LaForge) isn't gonna work when he's already got Riker, Troi, and Data involved.",Do You Think We'll Ever Get A Full-On TNG Reunion scene in Picard?
1,"Picard has gotten a lot of praise and dont get me wrong, it is well deserved. There is a lot to love about it. But I personally just found it kind of..... disappointing.
One major issue I had with it was the cinematography. I often found that while watching the episodes, there was ALWAYS something moving. No shot was just allowed to sit, it was always panning over here, panning over there, someone moving so let's move the camera with them, ooh look they're holding something let's zoom in. It was very distracting. Other than that visually it was good though. 
Another problem I had was that the characters weren't really built on very well. They were barely even introduced, and I didnt feel like i got to know anyone. Their conversations also always seemed a bit stilted and weird.
Some decisions the characters and even the show itself makes are pretty dubious. There were a lot of things they did that didnt seem to make sense.

The final episode though fixed all of these issues. In it the cinematography was good, the characters had depth and talked like humans,  they made decisions that actually made sense and, gonna be honest here, there were a few moments when I properly fanboyed out a bit that made me grin from ear to ear. I adore the finale to this show, I just think it's a shame I wasnt able to love the rest of it",Star Trek Picard finale (no spoilers) was a fantastic conclusion to a kind of disappointing show
1,"I have a ocd and a few problems and I just wanna say this show brought out the absolute best in me. It forced me to start thinking more logically. My ocd makes me fear alot irrationally and I don't know what to say but it made me better. My ocd symptoms are gone down my fears are melted away. It's a shame stupid people like my popular sister give it such a bad rep like we don't even talk normally about it. Anyway I finished next the next generation in under two months, and I'm on ds9 now. Its actually really great I love it. People are so shallow 😂 thank God for this show",Can u just say thanks lol
1,"Now that Season 1 of Picard is complete, we can finally do this right.

If you only watch the **essentials**, it's nine episodes of Trek, and two films. (Roughly two hours longer than the first season of Picard.) The optional episodes add another 11.5 hours.

If I'm missing anything, let me know and I'll make edits.

But keep in mind: This isn't an attempt to list _everything_ relevant to Picard. But rather a good ""primer"" that covers a lot of ground efficiently, and invites Trek noobs to keep watching the classics if they're sufficiently hooked. Arguably, I've gone a bit heavy on Lore and Borg backstory (and Guinan), but I'm also trying to account for what else might happen in Season 2.

(Thanks to u/YankeeLiar in another thread for helping to compile this.)

**Essentials in bold.** The rest is good to watch for relevant history, flavor, and because you're trapped at home in pseudo-quarantine.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation** 

* Season 1, Episode 13: Datalore _(Introduces Lore, but ""Brothers"" gets more done)_
* **Season 2, Episode 9: Measure of a Man *(Data development, Maddox origin)***
* Season 2, Episode 16: Q Who *(Borg origin, but ""Best of Both Worlds"" gets more done)*
* **Season 3, Episode 16: The Offspring *(Data and progeny development)***
* **Season 3, Episode 26 and Season 4, Episode 1: The Best of Both Worlds Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Picard vs. the Borg)***
* Season 4, Episode 2: Family *(Deeper Picard psychology)*
* **Season 4, Episode 3: Brothers *(Efficiently establishes Data vs. Soong, and more Lore)***
* **Season 5, Episode 23: I, Borg *(Hugh and ""borg hacking"" conceptual origin)***
* Season 5, Episode 25: The Inner Light *(Very optional, but a brilliant example of Patrick Stewart being Picard from start to finish)*
* Season 5, Episode 26 and Season 6, Episode 1: Time's Arrow Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Data and Guinan)*
* **Season 6, Episode 14: Face of the Enemy *(Tal Shiar)***
* Season 6, Episode 26 and Season 7, Episode 1: Descent Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(More Data, Lore, Borg)*
* Season 7, Episodes 25 &amp; 26: All Good Things... Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Picard's mental state)*

**Star Trek: Voyager** 

Noobs should at least watch ""Scorpion"", and then keep going if they like Voyager.

* **Season 3, Episode 26 and Season 4, Episode 1: Scorpion Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Seven's introduction)***
* Season 4, Episode 2: The Gift *(More Seven separation)*
* Season 6, Episode 16: Collective *(Icheb's introduction)*
* Season 7, Episode 2: Imperfection *(Icheb and Seven backstory)*
* Season 7, Episode 25 and 26: Endgame Parts 1 &amp; 2 *(Last time we saw Seven)*

**Movies** 

* **Star Trek: First Contact** *(The last, great Borg showdown)*
* **Star Trek: Nemesis** *(Romulans, and it's the last time we saw Picard and friends!)*

1,"Hey! So I’ll be honest I’ve never seen anything Star Trek, except a YouTube spoof series my old college friend showed me. I know one episode was about Spock badly painting a horse, but I can’t remember what the name of the channel or series was and I’m very interested! It’s very similar to DBZ abridged how TFS cut scenes from the show together to make the video. Also I after falling in love with The Orville I am really interested in Star Trek, and suggestions on where to begin? :) thanks in advance!",Not sure where else to ask
1,"I’m not sure if all would agree but the way data chose to die seemed a bit premature. I’m not sure but by the time of nemesis we don’t know how much and how long data was able to experience humanity with his emotion chip. So whatever Maddox put together to keep data alive doesn’t necessarily mean he was experiencing humanity. Am I missing something? 
Also with what they did with Picard. Would the Jean Luc Picard who chose to go about life with no regrets (emphasized in the episode “Tapestry”) choose to live on as a synth himself even tho he would have a finite lifespan? It’s gettin  philosophical but that’s what Star Trek is. No from each coming season I’ll find myself questioning if that’s really Picard or is that merely a copy/paste of the man known as Picard. I don’t know after watching TNG over and over gain since childhood I feel like picard would be against being transferred into the golem despite Data wanting him to live.
What do you fellow trekkies think?",Data and Picard
1,"1. Raffi 

She was right about the whole Romulan conspiracy. For years. And she never got a redemption moment, especially with her smug jerk of a son. She basically spends the last half of the show on the sideline. 


2. The Borg

Just there to look cool. The Cube could have held off the Romulan fleet, buying time while Soji reasons with the higher synths. Like the Phoenix, using a terrifying symbol of mass destruction for defense of a new race would have been a powerful, very Trek moment. But they just crash into the planet with a “lol. it didn’t matter.” It would have made Hugh’s death mean something if Seven had her hope restored and she and his rehabilitated xBs ending up be a key figure in the finale battle. Instead, they basically were window dressing. Take them out, and the story is the same. 


3. Dr. Soong 

Should have been Lore, honestly. But this is a personal opinion. Had he been Lore who upon being reactivated by Maddox, and learning of Data’s death, actually having a moment of character growth, realizing he’s all that’s left of his fathers legacy and helping Maddox continue his work in trying to make androids like Data. Then realizing getting the “evil” out of them was actually pretty difficult, and therefore he understood himself better and why everyone had such a hard time with him in the past... and then trying to redeem himself by reviving Data. 


4. Captain Rios

Inspired by Picard, he returns to Starfleet. I figured that’s what they were setting him up for. But then again, they’ve shown Starfleet doesn’t really exist anymore, unless you’re William T. Riker. 


5. Narek

Just got shuffled away at the end, and forgotten. What if he actually had a real turn at the end, since Redemption was alleged to have been what this was all supposed to be about. I really liked Picard’s housekeeper. She was fantastic, and made me realize it’s a tragedy that we’ve never had a “good guy” Romulan as part of the main cast of any Star Trek series before. Narek could have been a way to do that.",I feel like Picard had a lot of wasted potential.

Mine include;

* Guest appearance by Guinan.
* Guest appearance by the Doctor, who had been shut off during the Synth ban and will be reactivated following the events of the first season. A plot point will involve him adapting.
* Seven of Nine will be a reoccurring character.
* Elnor will be a reoccurring character.
* Other TNG characters, such as Geordi and Dr. Crusher, will reappear with a screen time similar to that of Riker.
* The characters learns the advanced synths hate humans because of that time Mike Nelson destroyed their planet.

look i have this thought which seems obvious to me,but it does not look like they (the people who make the decisions for ST content) are planning on making anything like that anymore .

what i want from star trek is a core trek experience. to me that's TNG,DS9,VOY type of show, a 7 seasons 20+ episodes per season  Procedural  show about a ship or a station, a solid/interesting cast and deep sci fi ideas.

i don't want this dark future (relatively) where the federation kinda sucks and the story is oh so very slow becasue you have to fill 10 episodes. i don't want any more shows that go into the past (ENT,discovery) and i definitely don't want any more TOS era movies (which to me are completely not star trek ,just my opinion).

make a star trek show like you used to make them in the 90's.

1,"Hey guys,

The scene from the finale where the Borg face off against the Super Synth beings while the Romulans fight Starfleet was one of the best scenes in Trek history.

I thought when I saw the synth tentacles that the portal might close, but I knew the writers wouldn't set up that whole scene about the prophecy and not follow through.

At the end when our dear scientist girl was put on trial for the murder of Bruce Maddox, I was worried but when he reappeared in a new body he invented and forgave her, that was pretty touching.

Also, Picard's death really hit me hard. Maybe it was the fact I knew they wouldn't pull some corny stunt like instantly resurrect him.

It seems obvious that Wesley Crusher is a Mary Sue and it seems obvious that Q isn't one. But Q is way smarter and way more powerful than Wesley Crusher. He's better than Wesley Crusher in every way except perhaps for his morality (that all depends on your interpretation of Q, how much of him you can take at face value and how much of it was part of ""the test."" Yeah, Tuvok's observation that Q has never been a liar is hilariously debunked) 

I guess some of you would object to labeling Wesley Crusher a Mary Sue or even to the existence of Mary Sue as a label. That's fine. That's not really the debate I want to have. I want to understand why Wesley is ***considered*** one by so many and Q never is.

I think perhaps its because Q is exactly what he's supposed to be. As an all powerful being, he never really does anything that's out of bounds for what he's supposed to be. You never say ""hey wait a minute, the author is deliberately pumping Q up to make him seem more awesome."" The writers actually use Q with a fair amount of restraint (probably owing to the incredibly limited budget). 

Whereas Wesley is kind of implausibly talented. He's supposed to be a human child yet he's already besting the entire starship crew. It would be one thing if this were just your run of the mill starship crew but this is the Enterprise, the flagship, so in theory these are the best of the best that Wesley is besting. And it only makes things worse when the writers decide that Wesley is basically the next step in human evolution or whatever the Traveler thinks he is.","How is Wesley Crusher a Mary Sue, but not Q?"
1,"They had no impact on the story. Every time they appeared they were quickly side-lined.

Their biggest plot-critical contributions (Soji talking to the Romulan aunt, teleporting Picard to Riker's world, getting rid of Narrek's fighter) had a million alternative solutions and some were only critical because they had gone to the Borg cube in the first place.

Despite being cybernetic they made no contribution to the synth storyline. Even 7 of 9, a Borg character, returned because of the Fenris Rangers rather than any Borg link. They produced no great character insights for Picard or any of the others. They just seemed to be there so the show could go ""Look it's the Borg!

The double facepalm is from the episode where Data creates Lal, I believe its called ""The Offspring."" I was going to ask about this one but I remembered it just as I was writing this post. 

The ""WTF is this"" gesture is Picard extending his hand towards the screen was in fact him waxing Shakespearean while playing the jilted lover to Mrs Troi in the episode where Troi, Riker and Lwaxana get abucted by Ferengi, I forget the name of that episode.

Right down to the big enemy being a space portal that we have to stop the monster coming out of that every Marvel and DC movie has used a million times. Awful on a galactic level.

If this were a brand new show about a retired military spaceman going on one last mission it would be lambasted for it's terrible writing and characters.

This quote bugs me for a few reasons. So first he says that he partly bases creative choices on provoking people. Why would you ever use pissing people off as a motivation to write a show that’s supposed to be about acceptance and hope? Seems like a cheap way of absolving yourself of blame by lazily saying that having haters was all part of the plan. It’s always super classy when a creative force behind something tries to minimize any hate or criticisms by saying that you’re not a true fan of you have them. So for anyone who doesn’t like your show then they don’t understand Star Trek? Perhaps you’re the one who doesn’t get Star Trek bud.

1,"When I was 9 years old my father was diagnosed with cancer. For as long as I can remember, he loved to watch the original Star Trek from the 1970's. By the time I was 10 years old, he was spending the last 3 months of his life in the hospital. He explained to us kids that God was going to 'beam him up' like they do on Star Trek when it's his time to go to heaven. Somehow I always pictured it that way, you get beamed up into Heaven. Well, the last week of my father's life, he held out to see that week's episode of Star Trek! The nurse told my mom that on the phone when she called from the hospital. Any time I see anything about that show I think about my dad. I now like to think that the past members of the show are in Heaven and my dad gets to hang out with them. He would like that.

1,"I get that the writers wanted her character to demonstrate a familiarity with Jean-Luc, but every time I hear ""JL"" I just cringe. Also, calling him Jean-Luc is already informal and shows familiarity. In TNG it was mainly just Beverly who called him by his first name.

But what have we seen instead? You naming a dog who doesn't come to save its master and never appears again, listening to Raffi whip out line after line of pure cringe, indulging Soji in her witless exploration of synthhood.

A: In your own paltry, limited way. You have no idea how far you still have to go. But instead of using the last nine episodes to change and to grow, you have squandered them.

Uhura once said something to the effect of 'it's only a word, it has no power to hurt me' when someone from the past called her a 'negress'. Here is PIC exec producer Michael Chabon's view on this, which I agree with:

&gt;No human society will every be perfect, because no human will ever be perfect. The most we can do—and as Star Trek ever reminds us, must do—is aspire to perfection, and work to make it so. Until that impossible day, shit is going to continue to happen. And when it does, humans are going to want to swear. The absence of swear words in Star Trek was never a matter of Federation principle, it was a matter of FCC rules. Writers of previous eras had no choice. They were censored. Swearing is one of humanity’s most ancient, sensible, and reliable consolations. Personally I would consider any society that discouraged, banned, or abandoned the use of curse words to be a fucking dystopia.",On the swearing in PIC..
1,"So let me get this straight, if there was a developing civilization of innocent and even peaceful people being overrun by edgy warmongers of their same species... the federal would let those lives be brutally killed off and have the planet become a space faring war race once they reached warp drive tech?
Like, I wouldn't even be suprised if just about every race the federal had a problem with, like the Klingons and Cardassians had this same altercation with their own kin from long ago, and, the bad won and now they have these war races that caused so much terror. In fact; we even see this with the Vulcons and Romulans, only, the species as a whole was too far in for one side to be destroyed so they had the chance to agree to disagree and split.

The acting is great (more on this below), but I mean it's taking a whole episode to move the plot forward 2 inches, then we side quest for an episode, gain nothing, and get back to the main plot. This entire concept could have been wrapped up in one episode of VOY/TNG/DS9. The lengthy irrelevant conversations between the supporting characters, the (i hope not intentionally) bad editing jarring from scene to scene.

Is it to distinguish her from Locutus of Borg? Or was it just something the producers just made up? I'm all for the blue laser eye, it was kind of cool really and on first viewing when I was a child, after Voyager's initial run as on first airing I was 4.

The episodes are two of my favourite episodes in Star Trek and probably my second favourite Borg story behind BOBW, it had Susanna Thompson in it for crying out loud, one of the best Star Trek actors to play multiple series behind Combs and the other greats.

- Rest in Flames, Gul Dukat and Winn Adami. You two deserved to burn.

1,"Only four years (and some change) away from the events in DS9 Past Tense.

Say what you will about DS9, Bashir, and Time Travel.  What is pertinent is the looming recession that results in wide unemployment and homelessness.  I have already witnessed the response locally over the last few years to the homeless population of hiding it under the rug by moving (through force or policy) homeless away from where they are easily seen.

Past Tense is one of the Star Trek episodes that I have always been impressed with its ability to accurately describe the human condition.  Now with a global pandemic and recession it is striking really hard and close to home.

It was an episode in which a few of the characters were stuck on a planet. They were inundated into fighting for a supposed group of refugees, including a young girl (who liked flowers, I recall) and her elderly grandfather. The main characters originally didn't want to get involved in the fight, but perceived the destruction by the empire as so devastating that they began to become soldiers fighting for the protection of the refugees. It turns out that it was all some training simulation for people to get brainwashed into being soldiers. 

I might have some of the details wrong, but does anyone have any idea of what episode I'm talking about? I desperately want to rewatch it. Thanks!",Help me find a Star Trek episode?
1,"I watched TNG when I was a kid, went on to DS9 and Voyager, Enterprise (surprisingly watchable), loved all the movies and have felt strangely detached from Discovery. 

Although Picard is a slow burn compared to the older stuff, I found myself thoroughly entertained despite several minor-to-medium sized oddities. It's not perfect but miles ahead of Discovery imo. A solid 8 out of 10 in my book, and yes, I know I'm in the minority here.

Anyway, I'll be the first to admit there are things I don't particularly liked:

1. Misscast of Jurati. Both the acting and writing is poor here. There's no emotional investment in her. Toss her out the airlock for all I care.
2. Budget Antonio Banderas. Was there some sort of competition with The Mandalorian for putting troubled yet sexy latino men into the mix? Anyway, Rios has grown on me, so hey,,
3. The actress playing Raffi is quite hammy at times. 
4. The shoehorning in of as many former ST characters as possible. Cheap trick for sure. Some have worked well, others much less so. 
5. Although I do find the overall plot sufficient for a series, I can't help thinking the writers got a bit too inspired by the Terminator series and, come on, haven't we gone through plenty of Real or not Real themes, especially with Data over the years?
6. The state of the Federation. Basically we know nothing except for them having banned synthetics. This sets them up almost as the bad guys. Don't know if it's poor or weasly writing, but I doubt Gene R would have approved.",I actually really enjoyed binge watching Picard.
1,"Don’t know if anyone has made this connection, 

Could the message/warning from the AI species, be in fact the from the machine world that V’ger encountered? 

After its encounter with Kirk and the crew and perhaps it returned there after vanishing. 

Due to the info obtained, interactions with organic beings, perhaps this led the machine beings to send the warning into the past based on V’ger’s interactions with Kirk, klingons ect.  Giving them all they needed to know (about organics) and the last chance for organics to prove themselves to the machine world, would have to be V’Gers own interactions with ‘The Creator’. Maybe Kirk et all didn’t do much to impress them after all.

1,"It's weird, right? Most shows from the 90s or 00s don't hold up well to 2010s or 2020 sensibilities, they are either too needlessly hammy, melodramatic or edgy. But I can show most old AF TNG episodes to regular, non-nerds and they would enjoy it (emphasis on ***most***). However, the movies just haven't aged well at all. They just stink of the era they came out on. 

 Even First Contact can't escape this. It has what I can only describe as a Nu Metal aesthetic, you know? First Contact and Nemesis, in particular, are shot like Music videos, while Generations and Insurrection are shot like TV movies. Not sure which is worse.

Why do you think that is? Was there a shakeup behind the scenes between the production of the TV shows and the movies? As far as I know, it was all Berman but they seem to be made by completely different people (barring the cast, of course). 

Mind you, I have 0 nostalgia for TNG, I caught up on Star Trek as an adult, way after college. Haven't even been that into sci fi until like 5 years ago, always been more of a crime fiction nerd.","Having rewatched TNG recently, it's amazing how well it hold up compared to the Movies"
1,"So I had never seen TAS until recently, when my dad got me to start by watching this episode. TAS was the Star Trek of his youth, so I figured I'd give this episode a shot. I know that TAS isn't very popular with Trek fans overall but this episode has actually aged like a fine wine, in my opinion. There's lots of little moments and themes in it that work extraordinarily well with all the Treks that have come out since then. 

There's a moment where Spock and the Andorian first officer who replaced him in an alternate timeline have a little moment of respect between them despite their differences, which if you're looking at this show as being post-Enterprise is so Star Trek it's almost painful. Just the fact that this Andorian officer is totally willing to hear Spock out and actually supportive of restoring the timeline so Spock has *his job* is exactly the kind of Trek I love, once described to me as ""competence porn."" Rational and emotionally mature people doing stuff not because they'll personally benefit, but because it is the right thing to do.

Spock's troubled childhood is a defining characteristic of him throughout the various series, and I think the way Discovery goes about it by saying that he actually had some sort of learning disability makes *Yesteryear* work even better. The way he is more or less bullied by the other Vulcans for not being the same as them makes me see why he resonates so much with audience members who might have similar differences.

Like I said before, *Yesteryear* is like, definition of a great Star Trek episode. It even has a moral dilemma at the end that, if you take it to one of its logical conclusions, is actually pretty controversial today (letting something or someone die with dignity rather than pointlessly prolonging a painful and unfulfilling life).

Anyway, I just thought I'd share this on here and maybe get some people to take a look at TAS. I've seen a few other episodes which all vary in quality, but *Yesteryear* to me definitely stands the test of time.",I'm in love with the TAS episode Yesteryear

We know Brent Spiner doesn’t have interest in playing data any longer because of his age so this could be a great way to connect Old trek and new trek through a recasted data. I don’t think this will be a real sacrifice as we know Picard will have a season 2.

But the idea of a great Star Trek community that does nothing but criticizes the shows they love is... ballsy. And you've certainly stuck to that premise. But I have some concerns. 

When you began, all those years ago. Hopeless that Trek would never return, only to get a new movies to hate..i was disconcerted

When you finally got a new series, actually set in the prime timeline. Only to write it off as hot trash because writers couldn't get away from prequels with bald Klingons and holograms, I worried.

1,"What the hell was he thinking stirring shit up knowing he only had seven more minutes on the planet? Kicking down the Romulans Only sign and sitting down to order a drink? That dude that Elnor killed—that’s on Picard as far as I can tell. If he had just laid low for seven minutes it wouldn’t have happened. I can’t think of any good reason the smart Picard we know and love would’ve done that.

Bonus unrelated annoyance: I’m annoyed that Agnes was in great spirits in the Freecloud episode all the way up until she decided to kill Bruce. I get that she overheard him talking about how the Federation was helping Zhat Vash. But prior to that in the episode she was presented as having nothing heavy weighing on her.",Picard out of character on Vashti [spoiler]
1,"I finished TNG and DS9 a couple months ago and started ENT against the recommendations of people online and it's pretty amazing. Best set design of any show, good cast, good crew. I'd rather take an icepick in the ear than that theme song but goddamn they improved it a lot in season 3. So anyway, now that I'm more than halfway through I'm wondering if I should watch TOS or VOY next. I don't mind bad or cheesy episodes but not an entire series of it.

1,"Hello !

I am a huge fan of Star trek since I saw the Abrams Trilogy.  
It is still one of my favourite trilogy of all time.

I then tried to watch the Original Star Trek and really didnt liked it. A few years later, Discovery was here, I saw it and I loved it ! the writting, the characters, the ambiance, the way they show all of this utopic society without falling in the ""everything is perfect""....Picard is also good, even if I prefer Discovery.  


But then I discovered that some fans dont like these series or movies, and I dont really understand why. They're awesome !

&amp;#x200B;

Could someone explain to me please ? thank you in advance !","What's the problem with the Abrams Trilogy, Discovery and Picard ?"
1,"Now as some of you might know, Data also had a mother: Juliana Soong/Tanier, as revealed in TNGs episode 7. (It’s a really sweet episode, btw.)


Juliana was actually an Android like Data, just an improved version with skin covering her circuitry, and actually unaware that she was an Android. (The real Juliana has died, and Soong built a new Juliana android, copying the dead person’s memories with an experimental device he had built.)


Now, what I want to know... **Why the F didn’t they use this on Picard?!?**


Soong type androids with human skin covering their robotic body. Indistinguishable from human beings at first glance, but actual machines underneath. 


It makes sense. As opposed to Picard’s ridiculous and credibility straining “synths” that nobody can really explain what are.


We could also forego the stupid “she’s Data’s daughter” positronic bullshit.


Ban! Maddox used Soongs research to create Juliana like-androids. Period. No “created from a positron” nonsense.

Picard’s reason to help them? Data would have considered them his brothers and sisters. It makes more sense than “Data’s daughter”. 

Or hell, just add Juliana to the story. 30 years later she found out she’s an Android, she’s somehow involved and in danger, and Data would have wanted Picard to help his “mother”.


Much better, no?",Why didn’t they use Data’s mother in Picard?!
1,"So I'm going through Enterprise again, and came to the episode ""Rogue Planet."" (S.1E.17). On this rogue planet is a race of shapeshifters, hunted by a bunch of aliens. 

When we first come to Odo's home planet in DS9, it's a rogue planet, and the shapeshifters there were hunted by solids for hundreds of years. 

What if the rogue planet in Enterprise *is* the home planet of the Changelings, and has been drifting across the galaxy? In 300 years, it wouldn't be a far stretch for it to have drifted to the Gamma Quadrant. It would explain further the Changelings' fears of solids. 

The only thing wrong with this would be that the shapeshifters in Enterprise are these slug-like creatures. But, what if, over time, they evolved into the Great Link and a completely liquid state. And the Founders forgot that it was a human who gave them the ability to truly hide themselves from their hunters. 

Is this the origin of the Founders of the Dominion? Is this a crazy theory? Is this my new headcanon? Yes. Is this just a really tired Trekkie spitballing? Also yes, but I had to share! 

P.S. I wanted to cross-post this in the r/DaystromInstitute, but didn't know if it would be welcome. Also, I don't know how to do that. Heeh.",Crazy Fan Theory - Enterprise and DS9
1,"Voyager is the Star Trek I like the least. SO many reasons, but three are:

1. Neelix. Annoying little shit!
2. Janeway. She knows more about everything than anybody else.
3. Neelix. Annoying little shit!

I'm 6 episodes into Season 1, and, yep, those memories are confirmed. Now, I don't blame the actors, it's how the characters were written.

I did enjoy seeing some spine from Chakotay when he stood up for B'elanna.

I'd forgotten that the Vidiaans were in it so early.

The micro-wormhole episode seemed a tad funny. I actually liked the episode, but where was the suspense? Obviously they were not going to get home! Still, a nice twist of the dagger at the end. 

Tuvok called Ensign Harry Kim a Senior Officer.... since when has an Ensign been a Senior Officer?

In Caretaker Part 2, Chakotay beams over to Voyager at the very last moment... when the hell did he have time to get his medicine bundle?

It's kind of funny to see small spots for Martha Hackett, knowing how big a story arc she gets later.

But..... I'm enjoying it more than I did the first time. It'll never climb off the bottom rung of Star Trek for me, or I doubt it will.... but it has become less bad :-o",Finally gave in and started to re-watch Voyager
1,"I’ve been thinking about the way the various series aged and how they compared to each other. We tend to seek-out patterns but I doubt that can ever really tell ya the whole story. I’m focusing on pre-Discovery series for now since I’ve noticed discussing Picard brings out the worst in people. I'm curious what thoughts or insights any of you have on this.

The Original Series: The general consensus is that first season was the best, and I would put season 2 on a comparable level. The decline in quality has generally been attributed to the slashed budget and the fact that Gene was no longer working on the show. 

The Next Generation: I've always thought seasons 3-5 were the best, and I've only met one person who thinks season 1 is the best. While TNG still offered a trickle of great episodes right up the end, seasons 6 and 7 seemed to be running low on ideas and resorted to introducing family members (both logical ones like Geordi's mother and left-field ones like Troi's sister and Worf's brother, Nikolai) and to Brannon Braga weirdness like ""Masks"", ""Genesis"", and ""Emergence"". Could TNG actually have been running out of possibilities or was there a malaise and lack of artistic courage on the part of the writers? 

Deep Space Nine: I think DS9 found it's footing early and allowed change to be a theme in a medium where the rule is generally to regress to the mean. However the series could easily have been wrapped-up in a few episodes at the end of season 6 and in many ways Season 7 felt like an artificial extension. While we did get some great moments in season 7 (""Badda Bing Badda Bang, Ezri Dax, and the finale arc, to name a few) it did feel like a less natural sequence of events compared to seasons 5 and 6. 

Voyager: I think Voyager generally had a problem committing to it's own premise. IT should have featured more planet-of-the-week storylines and fewer visits from old Trek than any other series, but instead we got recurring Q, Borg, Cardassian, and even Boothby. That being said, I think season 3 was when they series began to commit to looking back less often and taking risks with characters, and while I don't think Voyager was eve as good as earlier series, it didn't get much worse over the years and ended on a relative high note.

Enterprise: A weird outlier, Enterprise didn't approach good until season 4, when at least the writers were using the established cannon to build their stories from rather than trying to subvert the audience's expectations. Was this fanservice? Sometimes. But in a way, any Star Trek series is going to be fan service by it's nature. If you're writing a prequel series, the purpose is supposedly to feature elements from the universe's past and frankly any writer would be foolish not to want to draw upon the enormous universe that's been created, whether the audience is aware of it all or not. The fact is there's something to work with. So while I don't think anyone on the creative team had their heads in the right place from the start, at least they were able to understand the response and course-correct to some degree. 

You're thoughts?",Quality of each series over time.
1,"Here’s some (slightly abbreviated) opinions of mine on the TNG movies...

#Generations

Eh, it’s alright. I think plenty of things were wasted here like Kirk, Data’s emotions and Picard’s family being killed and the lighting is awful the whole way through (why does it look like the afternoon on an evenly lit spaceship?) but the action is good enough, I like the villain and it’s paced well enough.

#First Contact

I LOVE IT. I love the Borg in the movie, all the acting is very good, the action is intense and fun, it looks absolutely amazing the whole way through, and it keeps the excellent pacing from *Generations.* It’s my favourite Star Trek movie and one of my favourite movies of all time.

#Insurrection

It’s a decent movie. It feels like a TNG two parter with a much bigger budget, which you can take as you will. Nothing about the movie stands out as particularly awful or excellent, and it’s the slowest since *The Motion Picture* but I don’t mind it.

#Nemesis

I don’t hate it, purely because I like all the Trek movies, but I definitely would say this is the worst by a huge margin. The visuals are pretty decent, I like seeing the Romulans cooperating with the Federation and it’s not as slow as Insurrection but that’s it. The acting isn’t great, the plot is piss poor and the villain is the biggest waste of potential I’ve seen in the franchise. I can stand it, but I’d say this is the only really bad movie in the franchise.

#Final Rankings:

*First Contact* by a margin the size of the Alpha Quadrant.

*Insurrection*

*Generations* in a somewhat close third.

*Nemesis* in dead last.

What do you all think?",On the TNG movies
1,"So I'm up to date with Picard and in between episodes I've been watching the old shows again. I watch them in my own order cause I'm weird, but I finally got round to TNG for the umpteenth time, watching Wesley crusher go onto the bridge of the enterprise and his conversation with his mum beforehand got me thinking, wouldn't it be cool if Wesley turned up in season 2 as the newly appointed captain of the Enterprise? Or atleast he's been captain for a little while? And he turns up to help picard!

I understand the fans didn't like the character much on the original run of the series, but imagine how far he's come! Plus Mr. Wheaton is all grown up now.

If no one likes the idea that's fair! I'm just fantasizing I suppose 😂, please be nice!",Hear me out! (no spoilers for picard)
1,"So, basically this is the problem with some “fans”. Like, Star Trek always has been political. Yet some “Fans” will say “Discovery and Picard are Woke trash!” While both shows (and probably most Star Trek movies) are not really that political. 

Look, I’m not saying that liking more of the past Star Trek shows are bad (in fact, I definitely love TNG). It’s just that, some “fans” aren’t really remembering that much of how political are the past series. Which is kinda weird if they comment how “woke and sjw progressive trash” are the current Star Trek shows. 

And it’s not surprising to me on why some “Fans” gets easy trolled by everyone...",Blinded by “Nostalgia” and never see the true political meaning (on Star Trek “Fans”).
1,"I like this movie. I think as far as Star Trek movies go, it's pretty good. I was 14 when it came out, and it's very nostalgic. Almost as much as the show is. Is it's plot airtight? No. Is there a lot of stuff in there that doesn't make sense? Sure. But more than any other Trek movie? No not really. 

The action seems good though. The stakes seem very appropriate. Unlike Insurrection. The production value seemed pretty high, higher than First Contact I would say. The uniform mixing and matching annoyed me but I don't think regular folk would notice. 

I wasn't thrilled that they destroyed the Enterprise D but they needed a new model so that was going to happen no matter what. 

I also don't like how they killed Picard's family. It seemed rather pointless. 

I think it was kind of a waste giving Data his emotion chip in a movie, where there not really going to have any time to meaningfully explore it. 

But still, overall, I find this a very entertaining Trek movie. Probably my favorite of the bunch. First Contact is ok but they changed the borg so much, and pretty much just turned it into a big old action movie staring John Luck Pickard as john McClane. Yippe Kia-yay.",Star Trek Generations gets a bad rap
1,"Finishing getting caught up with Picard this evening, I was just curious if anyone else finds the design of these 25th century Romulan warbirds as irksome as I do. To me they look more appropriate as something Boeing would come up with as opposed to a ship of the line of the Free State. Romulan ships have always had such a presence about them - the D'deridex being many's favorite vessel design in all of trek. Even accepting that their nation has new priorities, and is perhaps is forced to streamline their designs due to resource constraints, I'd hoped for something much closer to a spiritual successor to the juggernaut that was their previous models. Personally, the ship referred to as Kerchan class is more along the line of what I'd picture that to be. /quarantineshitpost",[Pic] Bone to pick about ship aesthetics.

1,"It's pretty common on here to see posts telling new ST fans to avoid seasons 1 and 2 of TNG, and in fairness, there are lots of sub-par episodes. However, I think that there are still some really great episodes. 

Specifically, I think that ""Skin of Evil"" from Season 1 is not just good for TNG, but one of the best episodes of Star Trek. It's also very topical. The eponymous ""Skin of Evil"" in the episode sounds a lot like modern incel and ""nice guys"" who are overflowing with hate and anger because of how they perceive their own treatment at the hands of others. The episode also breaks the viewer's assumptions - I have to expect that just about everyone who originally saw it thought that Tasha would be miraculously saved at the end. And the very last conversation, between Data and Picard, continues to be poignant to me:

&amp;#x200B;

Data: ""I keep thinking - how empty it will be without her presence. Did I miss the point?""

Picard: ""No you didn't Data, you got it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my point is that for all of you new ST fans, do yourself a favor and watch all of the episodes. There are great bits everywhere.",Not all S01 episodes of TNG are bad
1,"I grew up watching tng, very familiar with those.  I have the dvds and have watched entire series a few times. I watched ds9 through once. Loved it but don't remember it super well. Watched maybe half of Voyager, plus a few random episodes. Watched about a season of enterprise, never watched discovery. 

Do i need to be familiar with events from any of those beyond tng? Would it make sense to jump right in with Picard or should i watch other things first? 

Sorry if this is answered elsewhere. I've avoided most posts from this sub lately because i figure I'll watch Picard eventually and want to avoid spoilers as much as possible",How much background do i need to watch and enjoy Picard?
1,"After being bullied by my wife into watching The Next Generation I started my journey about a week ago. Boy, I've been missing out.

We've been watching Discovery and I've seen the older movies when they've been on TV but I was never really interested in watching any of the older shows after getting through maybe two episodes of TNG Series One and deciding that I would rather gouge my eyes out with a spoon. But she persuaded me to get through the first couple of seasons and I'm glad I did because I've judst finished the episode where Q plays trumpet in a mariachi band. 10/10 Best Show Ever.

Some points for new watchers though;

1) Ignore the first couple of seasons. I can't think of anything that happened that made me feel that they're essential watching.
2) The complete shift in quality from Season 2 to 3 is HUGE. From story quality to cinematography and special effects it's like night and day. The only constant seems to be that the quality of acting is as good as it was in the early episodes, which is impressive since in those early days you could feel some of the cast wanting to scream at the dialogue they were being made to say.
3) Riker's nickname should be ""Shagger"" because he's a total lad.

That is all.",So I had never watched The Next Generation until last week...
1,"So, I recently decided to jump into the trek universe. I've seen all TOS, and making my way through TNG, VOY, DS9, and ENT (I'm waiting to start Picard after I finish TNG). I also started Discovery...and I'm having trouble with it. The serialization doesn't bother me, I honestly prefer an overarching story to episodic stories, but I don't begrudge anyone their preferences. I've also seen a lot of complaints about the grittiness of it, but I think people view the older shows with rose colored glasses. There was all sorts of violence and death throughout TOS (that horrifying teleporter accident in TMP) and TNG (head exploding and chest bursting). I think the content of the older shows was really just a product of the standards of their times. 

The thing I have the biggest issue with Discovery so far, is the terrible writing and unlikable characters. I'm about halfway through season 1 and it feels like a chore. While I kind of enjoy the morally grey Capt. Lorca, I find Saru is kind of just a dickwad, and Tilly is more cringy than funny. But the absolute worst is Michael. She's just so incredibly unlikable I can't bring myself to care about her at all. And so far there's this pattern that basically goes:

Captain: We have to do the thing!
Michael: No don't do the thing, it's bad! 

And then no one listens, resulting in her mutineering, or just breaking rules in general just so she can be proven right in the end, like she's some anointed savior of the galaxy and everyone is always wrong but her.

I know it's not unusual for shows to have rocky starts, but I do have to ask, does it get better? I've heard that Spock and Pike show up eventually, which I would be interested in seeing, but so far it's just a chore.

Also, why do they have to keep fucking with the Klingons? I don't think I've ever seen a race evolve so drastically over the course of what's supposed to be something like, less than 200 years? I honestly hate the new Klingon design.",A Trek Noobs Impression of Discovery
1,"Look, *Star Trek: Picard*.  I've been rooting for you.  I've been defending you to my fellow nerds and trying to see you for the beauty that you could be, just given a little time.  The idea of making a show about a character like Picard that does nothing but criticize the character of Picard is... ballsy.  And you've certainly stuck to that premise. But I have some concerns. 

When you had an admiral drop an f bomb to Picard's face in the heart of paradise right out of the gate, I was... disconcerted.  

When you started to portray Picard as Don Quixote, I went with it.  Sure, ok.  Not what I wanted but I'm along for the ride. 

When you ripped out Icheb's eyeball I was grossed out.   

When you had Picard turn his back on a person he supposedly loved so she could go live in a space trailer and get high, I worried.  

When you introduced a one-dimensional femme fatale incestuous evil chick as the primary antagonist, I was concerned.  

When you killed Hugh for no reason, I struggled but accepted it.  

When the Troi-Riker boy could have been saved by having a virus gestate in a positronic matrix ^(how does this even make sense) I started to smell bullshit. But they went to a planet with regenerative properties, hoping it would help.  Ok. 

When Soji, a being with wholly constructed memories, had a memory of her super secret homeworld that was brought forth with the zany Romulan walking through the room ritual, I sighed but said ok.  (Like why would Maddox give her a memory of that if he was trying to keep it secret?)

When the Federation turned synths into slave labor despite everything that the Doctor and Data accomplished, I thought ""hmm.  that's inconsistent with core Federation values.""

Then a gold skinned synth showed up *and learned how to mind meld*. Is there a tutorial?  Can I take it?

When you turned the synth colony into the bad guys, I knew, just knew, that you guys really had no fucking clue what you were doing from the start. Not story-wise, but artistically. and conceptually.  Is this Mass Effect 3?

And then there's super synths hanging out in subspace somewhere that, despite being super superior, can only protect other synths by wiping out all organic life **and that's the only option**.  Oh. My. Fucking. God. 

And ultimately there's been no leg work to make the synths on the Synth World seem like folks worth saving.  I almost agree with the Shat Vag or whatever they're called.  The scary ass synths on Mars were automatons (""Good morning, plastic people"") that murdered a bunch of folks.  And apparently the ones on the Synth world are totally down with killing all other life *in the fucking galaxy* so they can keep going on their planet with a population of... what, 50?   100?  Aren't these folks supposed to be good at math?  

I can't do this anymore.  I know you're going to have a big battle with lots of spolsions and pewspews and music next week, I'm sure it will be pretty.  I'll watch, because I suspect you'll have Picard become Locutus again to control a bunch of borg cubes or some shit and that sounds super cool.  But the magic is gone.   It's just spectacle now.  You're not relationship material, but I'll answer your booty calls.  If I'm free. How about you just text me instead.

1,"We are nearing the season finale, and I’m still confused by the whole Romulan situation, but here are the three main points. 

1.The J.J Nova

2.the rescue 

3.the empire


1. This is something I believe should have been left alone. In 2009, it seems that to supernova was near instant, but in a different star system(like hobus in STO). This, while still annoying, makes sense. There was no warning, which probably means foul play like the weapon in generations, and it still allowed time for Spock to get in his super fast plot dev- I mean ship and take his Maggif- I mean red matter and create a black hole. However, Picard messes this all up by having a two year period between the STOP of the evacuation and the supernova happening. And, it seems to be changed to the Romulan home system. This doesn’t make sense for two reasons.

A. It seems to be a natural event. Every weapon we have seen used on stars that create supernovas are instant. The weapon in Generations, the weapon in STO, other sci fi weapons all cause supernovas instantly. However in Picard it seems natural. The problem here is that the Romulans are nomads, they settled there about 1,800 years ago. If it was natural then the Romulans would not have settled there, or at least not for long.

B.There would be notable climate differences, such as droughts(see the inter light). However, in Reunification(about 31 years prior) we see that the climate is normal and in Nemisis the Star is a normal yellow dwarf. 

If it wasn’t natural, why was a there a 2 year period between the end of the evacuation and the supernova. If it was a Star like hobus, why didn’t the Vulcan science academy just use the red matter on it, since it most likely wasn’t inhabited. And if it was the Romulan home star, why is it that there was time for Spock to build a ship, warp at presumably warp 9.9999999 and get to Romulus juuuuuust in time to see Romulus get destroyed. And even then, why didn’t they use the red matter in the Romulan home star, they could probably use replicators for food and find some way to heat up Romulus for enough time to get the Romulans off.


2. The rescue also doesn’t make to much sense. Did the Romulans ask for help or not? During the interview Picard says the Romulans did ask for help, but then later, mister, “I’m just here to get my head chopped off” says no one asked for his help, and that they underestimated Romulan ingenuity and resolve. Also, how many Romulans would have to be evacuated. I thought it was 900 million, but then I get told it’s in the trillions. Why did the Federation hate Romulans so much that 14 members went all Kirk, “Let them Die!” They haven’t been at war for nearly a century, they were allies in the last war, the Romulans helped stop Shinzon, and Reunification was a thing, with loyalists in the Romulan Government and public(see Unification I and II, and face of the enemy). Also, why didn’t any other race like the Vulcans say anything about the Federation stepping out, especially since they tried to help Romulus in 2009.

3.The government is something the writers just randomly forget and remember throughout the show. From Seven we know the Neutral Zone has collapsed(I don’t see how this would cause lawlessness, but whatever), so we assume either civil war has broken out, or the entire government has just collapsed. However, it seems that the Romulans do have government with the Romulan reclamation project and the Zhat Vash. Since you need clearance to enter, there has to be some bureaucracy, and we know that the government didn’t immediately collapse after nemesis since mister, “I’m here to get my head chopped off” was a Romulan senator, so he would have to be put in power at some point. And since the Zhat Vash have about 200 ships possibly in total, Simone has to be financing that. Unless they are there own, “Nation” per say. However, wouldn’t that mean the Romulansare in civil war, or at least fragmented. 


God, this isn’t even naming the several other problems with this show.",The Romulans make no sense
1,"So I was inspired by someone else’s thread to slog through seasons 1 and 2 of TNG (I usually skip these when I do a rewatch). Admittedly, there’s some quality episodes that I hardly remember (which has been great), but man there are some bad ones. This got me thinking, what if MST3K decided to do a limited series on select episodes from all the series? The campiness and poor dialogue of some of these episodes would be perfect for their riffing.

Obviously, this is a pipe dream that would probably never happen, but do y’all think? What episodes would you choose?",An idea: MST3K Star Trek edition
1,"This week's episode just...wasn't good. The pacing was wrong. The androids were weird, the direction was weird. The 'admonition' sequence was kinda just a dumb melange of stock footage.

On the other hand, the week before I found to be a very good episode. Trek has always had stronger and weaker episodes, obviously, but I feel like the dialogue, direction and editing are a lot more hit and miss now than they used to be. And it kind of matters more now too, with continuous arcs. Put it this way: DS9 had arcs, and it never really had this problem, where one week it was good and the next week it was kinda garbage. Some episodes were kinda boring, especially in the early seasons, but it was almost always competent.

Why is this happening? When there are only ten episodes in a season, why are some of them so low quality? There's a lack of talent or oversight somewhere.

1,"The guy was such an integral part of the cohesiveness of Star Trek. He was responsible for the look of computers and alien languages and huge in keeping consistency with technology in Trek. He was the Technology Adviser from *The Voyage Home &amp; The Next Generation* all the way up to *Enterprise.* He wrote Technical Manuals for starships and even the Star Trek Encyclopedia. 

He was responsible for making sure there was consistency with the concept of a Starship within the rules of science within the universe, (how a starship docks, where things are, the size of certain areas, design lineage, transporter systems, science and remote sensing systems, tactical systems, environmental and crew support systems, flight and emergency operations, warp and propulsion systems ECT.)

He is still active on Twitter, answering fan questions about various Star Ships. How do you bring back Star Trek without bringing some of thebehind the scenes alumni back?

1,"If you had a friend who has never seen any Star Trek before, and was interested in watching Picard but worried they wouldn't understand what was going on, which episodes of the TNG era would be worth watching to have a good background? Pick up to 10. Two-parters are considered a single episode.

(sidenote: it's been pretty much confirmed that Whoopi is back for season 2)

Here's my list:

1. Measure of a Man (introduction to Bruce Maddox, a very Data and Picard-centric episode, with a heavy dose of Riker, and a dash of Guinan)
2. Q Who (introduction of The Borg, plus a dash of Guinan)
3. Ensigns of Command (another episode which heavily features Data and Picard doing what they do best)
4. Offspring (Data's desire to procreate coming to fruition, Lal's resemblance to the Asha-type androids, more Guinan)
5. Best of Both Worlds (Picard's experience as Locutus and Data's ingenuity on display in the second part)
6. I Borg (introduction to Hugh)
7. Tapestry (A great Picard character piece that also explains why his heart is artificial)
8. Descent (return of Hugh, Data's relationship with Lore on display)
9. Scorpion (introduction to Seven)
10. Imperfection (Seven's relationship with Icheb, and why Icheb has no cortical node)

If I had given myself more episodes, Inner Light and Data's Day would've made the cut for their impacts on the characters of Picard and Data, and likely so would Dark Frontier and Raven for more background on Seven (since the current state of play seems to imply she's joining the crew of La Sirena by season's end), but I think these 10 give a solid base for understanding and appreciating the series.

Obviously, the films Fist Contact and Nemesis may also be necessary.",Opinion: Which 10 Episodes of TNG-era Trek Are Essential Background For PIC?
1,"When this season started I thought it was going to be about Picard fighting for the soul of the Federation in (his) modern day, showing how an institution as noble as that might, in a moment of weakness, give into fear and begin closing itself off to refugees and racially profiling them, between the Romulans and the Synths. It seemed that would make a nuanced and socially relevant commentary on the state of the world right now. 


Instead it's now become this mess of Galaxy ending stakes and extremes which overshadow that. We've had little to no introspection from anyone actually within the current Federation structure, instead it's been simplified to ""the Romulans infiltrated the Federation and were responsible for most of it"", and then we get ""the only solution to surviving bigotry is killing billions of people"" from the Synths. It's jumped from simplified extreme to simplified extreme and lacks pretty much any nuance or exploration of the more subtle points of view which, sorry to even bring up the comparison, that the older Trek shows often explored and explored much better. Maybe that's the blessing of a limited budget for action scenes. 

Hell even The Founders, for all their bigotry against solids, didn't just jump to ""all solids everywhere must die"". 

The show has allowed the ideas presented during Picard's interview speech, about how we treat lives, to be overshadowed by yet another Galaxy ending debacle ( along with a bunch of unnecessarily horrific shock deaths and edgy elements like heavily implied incest ). This isn't even the only time within the past 12 months that new Trek has done the ""artificial intelligence threatens to kill all organic life"" plot.

Just disappointing on that front. The show let the fate and politics of dealing with refugees and prejudice be overshadowed by these exaggerated stakes. 

I am aware that the season technically isn't over yet, but that said I feel fully comfortable making a judgement when most of the episodes are out, and I got to say it's been an overall disappointment for me.",My disappointment with the conflict set up in the PIC season finale.
1,"I feel like the new Star Trek shows could have embraced the cinematic universe concept even further. Instead of giving *PIC* a massive backstory that we would never fully see, they could have had several precursor series filling that out before culminating *Avengers*-style. There would be a *Star Trek: Last Best Hope* miniseries effectively serving as a sequel to *Nemesis*, bringing in legacy characters; a *Fenris Rangers* show developing Seven’s relationship with Icheb post-*VOY* and maybe a setup for Hugh heading the Borg Reclamation Project; heck, maybe even a *DS9*-centric miniseries that ties in to Freecloud. Instead, all this information is stuffed into a ten-part pilot, with not much indicating that we’ll go back and explore this background stuff more deeply later on.",Star Trek: Picard could have worked better as the culmination of a “phase” of lead-in shows
1,"How do you think things are going to pan out? My predictions:

\- The Borg ship will protect Coppelius from the Romulan attack, but it won't be enough.

\- The Starfleet squadron will arrive in the nick of time and turn the tide, including Captain Troi-Riker (I think that would be pretty cheesy, but they did foreshadow it by mentioning he was on reserve).

\- The androids will come to understand that not all organics want to exterminate them, and peace will be made.

\- The XBs will settle on Coppelius alongside the synths, making the world a safe haven for outsiders like them. Seven of Nine will not join them.

\- Narek and Elnor will have a confrontation on the Borg ship; two Romulan orphan boys who were led down very different paths.

\- Jurati and Soong will help Sutra build a beacon to summon the ancient synthetics. One or both will turn against Sutra, and one (probably Soong) will be killed.

\- Soji will defeat Sutra, and she and Picard will guide the remaining synths to a peaceful outcome.

\- They will dangle the possibility of Picard uploading himself to the Golem, but he won't do it. Ultimately someone else (Jurati?) will take that step to form a bridge between organic and synthetic life.

\- It will be left ambiguous as to whether the beacon successfully transmitted its message.

\- Picard and Raffi, and maybe Rios, will be offered their Starfleet commissions restored. They won't accept. Picard has a few more sights he'd like to see with what's left of his time, and he'd prefer the freedom of La Sirena for that.

\- The episode ends with a montage of outtakes set to the music of Smash Mouth.",Picard finale predictions
1,"From what I've seen, people defending Sutra's ability to mind-meld are generally doing it from an in-universe plausability perspective - Spock did it with V'Ger, it's not impossible that a synthetic being would have the necessary biology for it built-in, etc. And that's fine. It's not like Trek science has ever been super rigorous and consistent, and after all, one of the appeals of science-fiction is weird unexpected things happening. Artificial life learns to do telepathy? Cool! 

My problem with it, though, is that if feels like it's there because the writers went ""Quick, we're in the second to last episode, how do we get this Admonition thing to the synths? Uh... I don't know, let's have one of them learning to do a mind-meld. Wait, can they do that? I don't know. They can if we need them to, and I'm sure the fans will find a way to rationalize it. Ok, can't think of anything better, let's do it."" And all that after making a point that Troi can't read Soji.

Basically, it feels like it's not there as some novel piece of worldbuilding, or an exploration of a cool sci-fi idea, or in service of some theme (like Spock and V'Ger). It's there because they needed a shortcut, a cheat, it's a plot-device. They drop this pretty big and potentially very interesting idea on us in a completely non-chalant ""oh ok, this is a thing *shrug*"" way, just so they can move the plot forward, and I just find that dramatically unsatisfying and a bit intelletually lazy. I doubt her ability will even play much of a role further or that the implications will be explored any more.

1,"[perhaps a slight PIC spoiler]

Aside from Patrick Stewart, I think LeVar Burton has the most cred prior to Star Trek and was clearly capable of a more in-depth role. I’ve been rewatching TNG (for the millionth time in my life, thanks quarantine) and his stand-alone episodes are fairly anti-climactic. I always found that in episodes where a character is captured or stranded, it provided a more intense character development but that didn’t really happen with Geordi when he was captured by the Pakleds, brainwashed, or stranded with the Romulan. So many opportunities him to have gone to a ‘Sins of the Father’ or ‘The Measure of a Man’ level. For being considered one of the greatest engineers in Starfleet, his roles for the most part are usually just portrayed as Data’s friend or involved in a failed love story. 

We’re aware he was greatly involved in Picard’s mission to evacuate Romulus yet he wasn’t mentioned in PIC. Hopefully we see him in the next season? I’m not one who thinks Picard needs to be one big TNG reunion but if anyone should get involved I’d think it would be him.",Am I the only one who thinks Geordi never had the character development he deserved?
1,"In the last episode, we got to see the unscrambled message from the Admonition. And, one part of it stood out to me like no other part:

""***Beyond the boundaries of time and space, we stand***""

This hit me when I heard it, not just because it sounds cool -- but if you take it at face value, we have to ask ourselves, who could these super synths possibly be? There's only **one** race/group that we've seen, so far, who **truly seems to exist completely outside the constraints of space, and time**. And that would be: **the Q Continuum**.

This has led me to wonder: are these synths from a similar place? 

We know from TNG that, at some point infinitely in the past -- maybe even in a different universe, the Q were more similar to humans, than Gods. What if the Q actually lived lives, developed technology... **created synthetic life**? If the Q evolved, or ascended to a state of Godhood, what happened to their machines? Were they sentient? Could they also have evolved? 

Or, to put it simply: Did the early Q create the Admonition? And possibly discarded them, or, did something not-good to them that convinced the Adminition that all natural life is terrible. This would possibly explain the Q's specific interest in Jean Luc Picard. Other than him destroying the galaxy with the anomaly -- maybe his final, most true purpose (what the Q were guiding him to) was to stand on the apex of the Admonition's entry into our reality.

(Sudden record scratch)

Now, all this is assuming that this isn't a **Sybok-level fakeout**. We've seen being pretend to be God, from the Trek movies, to Janeway's fake dad. So, for all we know, everything the Adminition says is ""a buncha hooey"", and they're just some extradimensional Borg-like invaders. There is certainly evidence that they're **just plain bad guys**, considering everyone -- and I mean **everyone** who sees their message seems to turn **violently genocidal** (from the Romulans, to Sutra). Not to mention that their message doesn't quite add up, seeing as they say that they're both watching from beyond time, while also asking to be invited to come help.

Or, to put it another way, ""***What does Synthetic God need with a Beacon?***""","A lunatic theory about a possible synthetic *Q*onnection, assuming it's not all LIES (Spoilers and incoherent rambling for Picard ep 9)"
1,"Bare with me, as some of you might find this question stupid. So just correct me if I'm wrong or missing something here. I also still have to watch next weeks episode, but I dont mind spoilers.

Okay. So, **Robots** are machines that can replicate humans. **Androids** are AI robots with human appearances. Data is an Android with a **Positronic Brain**, which is a processing unit that gives androids relatable human consciousness. Dahj and Soji were made out of a remnant **neuron** (nerve cell) from Data.

I guess we dont know how they were made fully yet. But we do seemingly know that Dahj and Soji are *basically* mostly flesh and blood. Indistinguishable from human. No technology or machinery is present. IMO they seem closer to clones or ""Frankenstein monsters"". How does something mostly flesh and blood ""activate"" and obtain super human strength. If having no robotic body parts, how are they androids? They are definetly synthetic life forms, but again, they seem more closely related to Augments or clones or just petty dish bred babies. Soji basically human. Which is the point Picard is trying to make. But she has super human powers like augments, which I feel is a far and away better description than android or synth.

They seem to use the term synth more often but have referred to Soji as an android a small handful of times if I recall correctly.",Question regarding Androids/Synths/Dahj/Soji.

I've been trying to figure out if there's another way down to the lower floor. At first I assumed there'd be a corridor going around the mess hall area so you could go through the door below the bridge. However with the last episode showed the escape route and the outer hull.

With the force field in episode 8, there's no way to the floor below other than that stairway. Yet there are what I'm assuming stairs at the back of the cargo area, and some railed off areas to the sides. I haven't been able to catch any doorways on the lower level though.

1,I just got done watching all 4 seasons of Enterprise. What a great show. I feel bad for not watching during its run. It’s like the perfect prequel where you see how things started. Season 3 was the best. It probably should’ve been what voyager was. How they got desperate with resources and how the captain had to make hard choices. Season 4 was all over the place but it was cool on how they explained the Klingons and khans people. That finale was great. Sad to see Tripp dies but anyways. I love Star Trek. Can’t wait to see discovery and Picard.,Enterprise!!!! (Tv show)
1,"(Perhaps this isn't original, and has been discussed, but I couldn't see anything) 

So, my wife and I didn't get to finish watching the last few minutes of the last episode last night because our son woke up (he's been a bit uneasy with everything going on these days and still young)

But from what I did see last night, not related to the whole Synth plot, but towards Picard's life coming closer to the end.... My wife said, ""People are going to lose their nerd shit if they kill off Picard. How are they going to keep the show going with the Title character gone?""

I said it no doubt will be more about his legacy than the actual living person. I mean, I know Stewart took inspiration from Prof X in Logan and he seems to be trying to give proper send off's to his most popular characters. He's not a spring chicken any more. He knows it, we all know it.

But why go through all this effort to build up this new world, new time, get us invested in all these new and old characters, all to have Picard eventually die after say, one season (which it looks like is happening)?

Why call it ""Picard"" when the title character is set to die so soon?

He may continue into Season 2, but I don't see Picard/Stewart lasting beyond 2 seasons and I don't think Stewart plans to keep this up for several more seasons either.

The answer is in the show's title.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The title references the space station.

Star Trek: Voyager. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Enterprise. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Discovery. The Title references the Starship.

Star Trek: Picard. The Title references the Starship.

That's right. It currently references and focuses on Picard the person, but my guess is that eventually Picard is going to pass away and his legacy and everything he and his new crew does this season to save the universe leads to either their current ship being renamed Picard, or they somehow end up with a new Starship named U. S. S. Picard.

Before we stopped watching the show, one of the last scenes I recall is him walking away from Seven and into the light saying something about the responsibility of saving the galaxy was now up to everyone else..... He's passing the torch and he's going to be done soon. 

I believe when Picard does die, Seven, Elnor, etc. are going to join up with his crew, as will Soji and most everyone else we've seen regularly, and they're going to carry on his Legacy into the following seasons while doing it under the Banner ""Picard.""

For so long the name Enterprise has been used for many ships and that name became a symbol, a meaning to people. First it was about exploration and now its kind of that + Flagship of the Federation and its ideals.

This show and Picard himself it setting it up that the name Picard becomes a symbol, a meaning beyond just exploration and federation ideals (cuz the Federation itself has become a little flakey in its ideals) - It'll be about individual ideals, about how one person can make a difference for everyone and how one person, you, I, whoever, can help stand up for each other, our rights our freedoms. We can't rely so much on institutions (Federation/Our current governments) to pamper our lives and give us a utopia. We have to rely on ourselves and each other, those we trust, to stand up and do what's right.... Which is exactly what Seven has been doing.... Which is exactly what Picard has been doing, and most of the other main characters.

They've all kind of gone rogue from the institutions, banded together and working together for a common goal.

TL;DR

The title of the show is referencing the Starship Picard and its crew.",[Spoiler] Star Trek:Picard - Theory about the show's title itself.
1,"TL;DR -- Reminds me of Dad.

My daughter is almost 14. She'll never admit it, but she's a big fuckin nerd. That's OK - I am too. But she's a giant nerd. The kind of nerd that won't admit to being a nerd, but is totally cool with dressing up as Jadzia Dax (DS9, obvs) for Halloween and letting Dad draw Trill spots on her face with a brown Crayola marker. I've been trying to get her to watch ST with me since she was 3. I started her on ST:TNG...which in my household is now called ""The Airplane Show"" because we never much made it past the cold open and the opening credit sequence....but she LOVED the warp jump part and decided it was one hell of an airplane!

So anyway...when I heard ST:Picard was a thing, I decided we had to watch it. We've never gotten around to the movies as a family, but I didn't think that would be a problem. There's always Netflix and *yarrr* options to fill the void, or kill two hours while we fold laundry together. 

We got through about the first half of the first episode of ST:P, and she's got questions. I off-handedly answer one of them with ""Yeah, Data's dead in this series. He's been dead for a while.""

Girl busts into tears. Unexpected instant tears. I mean, gut-wrenching ""holy fuck my entire family is dead"" tears. Ab-wringing sobs of loss. She threw a pillow across a room and screamed at me: ""Data's been dead for YEARS and ***you didn't think to TELL ME!!!!***"". She stomped off. We did *not* finish the first episode that night. It may have been hormones, but I don't want to be a chauvinist pig. She was right, though: Data died years before she was but a twinkle in my eye; I did not think to tell her. In any case, she was WRECKED to find out that the favorite son of Soong would not be returning to the screen. 

Data is her #1 favorite character. He's my favorite character not named Jean-Luc, too. He wasn't autistic, but he may as well have been. She's not autistic, either, and neither am I...but we both may as well be. Data's social ineptitude shines a brilliant limelight on our own interpersonal weaknesses.

Picard .... well, Sir Patrick Stewart to be precise (although I've never been in the same building as him in person) ... Picard is like a father figure to me, even at this ripe old age somewhere between 35 and 40. I know that's a cliche fanboi thing to say out loud. I know he's as fictional as Dixon Hill, but bear with me. Dad and Sir Stewart share several facial features and some expressions which I've seen on screen since Season 1 of TNG, and seen in my home since I was but a wee lad. (As an aside, I almost can't watch my favorite episode *The Inner Light* anymore, because now the makeup of ""old Kamin"" on Picard vs. how Sir Stewart really looks instantly jars me from my suspension of disbelief.) Dad never had so little hair nor as much forehead, but every time I see the actor, I think of my dad. Every time I see the early seasons of TNG, I remember sitting in my Dad's armchair with him watching a janky 19-inch JVC CRT TV with bad color while the wood stove sparked and popped, hating every minute of TNG...because in those days, TNG was on CBS in the same time slot that new Simpsons episodes were on Fox. DVRs weren't a thing. We only owned one TV.

I grew to love *love* ***LOVE*** the TNG world while sitting uncomfortably on the arm of that recliner in the basement, and from there, a lifelong ST fan was born, thanks to Dad. I'm merely trying to pass a little of him to my baby girl in my own way. 

Dad died in 2018, just under 3 months after he welcomed my family back under his roof. She didn't do well when Dad died. It was sudden, violent, and unexpected. Here for breakfast &amp; gone before dinner, like the transporter accident Dr. Pulaski was so fearful of. Myself, I'm still processing that 18+ months later. But every Thursday, we sit down together and bond a little more for an hour, as father and child. The plot's irrelevant, the cameos and philosophical wink-winks are but a reminder of my unresolved existentialism, there's too much lens flare for my liking for something not associated with Abrams, and the points are made up and the scores don't matter. None of it matters. For one out of 168 hours each week, I get to sit down with my eldest child while the wood stove pops and sparkles...and we marvel at the wonderful universe that Roddenberry and his writers dreamed up more than half a century ago. I still miss Data. I still miss Dad.

It would not be hyperbole to claim that Star Trek and Data have permanently changed my simple existence for the better.

1,"(a) After *First Contact*, I remember discussions about whether the ship that landed in Bozeman was an actual starship or a landing vessel attached to a larger starship in orbit.  Did we ever come down on that one way or another?  Memory Alpha explicitly says that the lander was a starship, but I can't find a source for that.

(b) Memory Alpha says that the lander was the *T'Plana-Hath*.  They cite this to *First Contact* (which definitely didn't mention the name), ""Desert Crossing"", and ""Carbon Creek"".  Does anybody know from which of those latter episodes we learned the name?

(c) Memory Alpha (MA) also explicitly says that *T'Plana-Hath* only had a three-person crew (""The senior of its three-person crew…""), but this is only cited to *First Contact*, and I'm certain that the film never made it known that only three Vulcan crew were aboard the ship.

1,"Both finales have to do with the protagonist having to prevent a group of ""good"" guys from committing something as extreme as genocide. 

I honestly do not like how fast PIC just jumped to that extreme. ""The only solution is to destroy all organic life"". Really? There's no other ways this plot could have been taken besides going the ""hey guys, killing billions of people is not a solution"" route again? 

And the Synths became highly unlikable within 10 minutes when they near universally agreed to genocide while they still had other options like to leave with Picard through that convenient escape tunnel. 

At least in Discovery, for how much I personally didn't like the genocide plot thread of trusting a dangerous oppressor from the mirror universe with a planet-ending bomb, only jumped to that after establishing the Federation had been through a long horrific war that they were about to lose ( even if that was still a bad idea to kill billions ).",The Discovery and Picard Season 1 finales share the same conflict so far.
1,"Hi.

I just finished watching ""Interface"" earlier today. I read that when the writers were talking about bringing in Geordi's mother there was a sort of collective groan that the writers were starting to run out of ideas.

I was wondering if anyone knew when the decision was made to make season seven the final season. 

I've heard that Paramount was pushing for production to shift its attention to movies in an attempt to replicate the success of the original cast's movies. I've also heard that Patrick Stewart's contract expired after season six, so he agreed to a one-year extension. 

Season Seven just always felt like they were kind of wrapping things up.  The stuff with Damon Bok, ""Lower Decks"", Riker's past, Worf getting a glimpse of what's to come for Alexander,  the conclusion of the stories for Ro, Wesley, and the Traveler (well maybe ""conclusion"" isn't the right word, but I think you know what I mean), and the finale certainly feels like a finale. 

Even in the season six finale, ""Descent"" feels like it's sort of ending the storylines for Hugh, Lore, and the Borg.  Did they know by that point that seven was going to be the end?",When did TNG know that Season 7 was the end?

2: Unexpectedly bursts in and saves Elnor from Roluman goons using firepower. Loses all the dormant Borg.

3: Unexpectedly bursts in with a cube and saves the crew from Brocest (Narek). Loses that cube to flowers.

1,"There is one topic that bothers me since a couple of episodes of PIC.

As we recently learnt, in 2390 the *USS ibn Mājid* encountered a pair of synthetics emissary in the Vayt sector aboard a small craft. So, Commodore Oh already knew quite precisely the location of the Synthetics homeworld: she clearly had access to the *exact* position of the *USS ibn Mājid* and she knew they couldn't be far from home. In the best case scenario, she might have had navigational information extracted from the alien craft's computer, also.
In the worst case, she knew the sector they were in and one sector is a **very** small place to search, in astronomical terms.

So, Oh already had that big amount of information, nevertheless Rizzo and Narek spent months, if not years, to get to Soji, earn her trust, and extract just some vague details about a planet. Much less details Oh already had.

So, my question:

* is Oh willingly keeping all this knowledge from her so-called *allies* and she has her own agenda?

1,"One thing that really stuck out to me this entire season was the idea that the Artifact was presented extensively to show the transformation of the Borg as a faceless horror into an entire species of victims who still deserve to exist, and to exist with some kind of dignity and empathy. I know this was discussed in Wil's Ready Room, that the idea that the Borg have become humanized and deserving of pity is a crazy concept at first but it makes sense.

That said, I think it was no coincidence that Seven brought the Artifact to Coppelius. Yes, the pretense is there that she wanted to use it to defend the Synthetics from the Romulans. But realistically, the Artifact isn't in working condition and it is crewed by xBs who are no longer part of a collective. It's a last ditch effort (literally! since it ditched on the planet) to provide some kind of resistance.

The REAL reason is that the xBs will somehow provide a bridge or link between the Organics and the Synthetics that will unite the two that will spare either side from absolute destruction. The xBs are a species of Organics that spend their existence being integrated with the artificial. They are the ideal transition between the two groups and could be the Saviors of both. I don't know exactly HOW that will play out, but I can see this idea being the linch pin of the entire season. I think it was no accident that we spent the better portion of the season talking about the Borg if they are intended to be the focal point of the finale. And it will be entirely fitting that Locutus and Seven should be there to ensure that it happens. It's a shame that Hugh wouldn't be able to see it. 

Yes, there will probably be some big space battle and it's possible the Federation will show up en masse for some real pyrotechnics. Then again, the Borg are the trump card that neither side is expecting to be the means of resolving this seeming impasse.",Spoiler Theory about the final season 1 episode of Picard
1,"After watching the latest episode and taking a bit of time to think on it, I came to a realization. (in theory)

The prophecy about 'The one who died' and the one who lived becoming 'The Destroyer' wasn't about Dahj and Soji at all, it was about Jana and Sutra. 

Jana and Sutra were also paired sisters. Jana died on the Ibn Majid, and Sutra is now bent on bringing destruction to the entire Galaxy of organics. 

The crazy Zaht Vash auntie on the Borg artifact mistook Soji for Sutra since they look almost identical.",[Spoilers] The Destroyer theory
1,"So, I just finished Discovery's first season after a paced binge over about a week and I really enjoyed it. There was a lot to adjust to at first, but I found I really appreciated the characters (Saru, Tilly and Georgiou in particular) and want to see where they're going.         
Little background on myself, I wasn't really a huge Star Trek fan growing up, even though it was always there in the background (my father loved TOS and TNG, while my mother loved VOY). Voyager was probably my favourite of the seasons growing up but I caught a lot of TOS and TNG on television too, along with some of DS9 and I bought the Enterprise DVD sets when I was about 17. Recently I've gotten more into the franchise thanks to Picard and Netflix rewatches of both VOY and TNG. I decided I'd give DIS a chance since both my parents enjoyed it.                                             
I suppose I'm now wondering why it gets such a bad rep among fans? It seems a perfectly decent entry into the franchise and has very strong potential. What exactly is it that puts so many people off? There's elements I didn't really appreciate, the Klingon redesign is not great, but definitely not as drastically terrible as I've seen people imply. Burnham does pull a lot of focus, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, given that she's a complex and compelling character (and I've always been a fan of Sonequa Martin-Green's work from OUAT to TWD). I didn't really care for the romance between her and Tyler, or ultimately him as a character at all. I appreciated the continued dedication to diverse representation that TOS pioneered back in the day; in particular seeing a happy, healthy, but also flawed gay couple was great (even if one of them bit the dust too soon).              
I thought there was a lot to like. Great costuming, makeup, set design, graphics. Add on a stellar cast (seriously, Michelle Yeoh, Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Jason Isaacs and RENT veterans Anthony Rapp and Wilson Cruz).          
I'd love to hear what people didn't like about the show so I can see it from a different perspective!",Just Finished Discovery Season One
1,"I’m honestly feeling like Picard is a guest star in a show named after him. We barely see him get any screen time over 10 episodes, he usually gets people mad and swearing at him, he is a shadow of his former self and it’s sad to see, he makes maybe 1 or 2 interesting uplifting mini speeches, he sits in his house in France a lot, or it’s holo version on the ship, or in the side chair in the back corner on the bridge of the ship, and everything like I mean everything is about his obsession with soji/data and some occasional reminiscing, where is Picard the diplomat the archeologist, the artist, the explorer, the orator?

Like the show is freaking called Picard but in just 10 episodes I feel like we have met more new people than an entire 24 episode season of TNG and it’s getting just silly and exhausting. 

Too many new characters and some old ones and gathering them all together and too little Picard time and too slow moving a plot.",Why is it called Picard ?
1,"I was watching Best of Both Worlds again the other day and I noticed how throughout most of the series, Data's android strength is like that of a piece of solid, industrial machinery. In contrast, Dahj (and most androids and superheroes in general these days) is depicted as being able to run fast, leap far, and perform acrobatic feats with incredible agility.

It felt surprisingly ""fresh"" to see that when Data is being strong it's not like he's a ninja, but more like he is girded to the floor, with a hydraulic cylinder delivering power to his arms.

(I know there is an early episode where he is shown to have super speed, but I think they abandoned that idea)",I like how Data felt really heavy
1,"When an organic sees it, it either drives them mad or successfully communicates the part about all organic life being destroyed, tying the destruction in some sense to synthetic life flourishing. If the organics who stumble upon the message all die, well, nobody is going to want to go back there and the synthetics they eventually create won't know about the message. If some of the organics who receive the message live, then they'll relay the message of danger to others or take action themselves to stop the rise of synthetic life.

Neither outcome encourages the flourishing of synthetic life, nor do they help ensure synthetics hear about this supposedly great civilization that is waiting for them to make contact. Why do organics get the same message as synthetics? The message could impart the impression that the great race that moved the stars benefited greatly from synthetic life, and encourage the development of synthetics. Or it could present a puzzle that suggested it might be solved by a synthetic mind or AI for great gain, thus encouraging organics to bring their synths to the planet so that they might receive the real message.

The admonition doesn't make sense for synthetics, either. If you interpret the message literally, these beings will destroy or somehow cull all organic life in the entire galaxy if you summon them. The leader of Soji's people (can't remember her name) is trying to get them to do it to save their world from the Romulans, but even she seems to think at least some organics will be spared. That's not quite  what the message said or implied. Even if you were OK with genocide on that level, what about your own safety? Beings that carry out that kind of wanton destruction and who care so little about it that they just advertise it to anything that finds their special planet might well be something you don't want to meet.",The Admonition makes no sense
1,"First, before people think I'm going to baselessly slag off the show, know that I enjoy aspects of it and wholesale like it more than Discovery. There are some foundational things that irk me, however.

Assuming next week ends with a big space battle (much like Disco S2) rather than a more discursive one, it leaves me wondering where the contemplative format went off course. But then, I'm more inclined to look at the background of the thing, and the 'presumptions' that underlie the show as a whole.

Romulus' star goes supernova without warning. Romulans, being a species so enmeshed in science (and deviousness) would be able to detect if something were naturally wrong with their star. Being it was sudden, it was likely an artificial reason for its supernova. The first thought they'd likely have is that it's a Federation plot to destabilise the empire, which isn't unreasonable. We don't know what's been happening since the events of Nemesis, though there were indications that relations between the Romulans and the Federation were easing. 

(At this point, we could see the S31 argument that their calculations concluded the time was ripe to completely destabilise the Federation's oldest enemy, or something.)

We've seen that there are weapons able to induce supernovae (DS9), so it's not an unreasonable conclusion that it was artificial rather than natural. However, it's not something dwelled on in the series, even though the Romulans would be working overtime to figure out what happened.

Further, the destruction of the Romulan homeworld would be the perfect opportunity to explore what happens when an empire has a vacuum of power in the middle, and what happens when a longtime foe either sits by and watches anarchy take its course, or attempts to broker stability. This is where JLP would be integral in the series- rather than the odd circumstances surrounding Romulan refugees and whatnot (since a supernova wouldn't necessarily affect all the planets in the empire, which we know has hundreds of worlds), we could see JLP take on his more traditional ambassadorial role and attempt to broker peace from all sides. 

Consider the case of Julius Caesar. After his murder, Rome was ruled by the Second Triumvirate, which devolved into civil war. Much like DS9, it would present a good opportunity to take a deep dive into the dividing lines of Romulan society, what creates those divisions, how those divisions can be reconciled, and would give JLP a better opportunity to stretch his diplomatic muscles, even in light of his irumodic syndrome. And, if the supernova was a S31 plot, it gives JLP the opportunity to weigh the ideals he holds dearly against the calculations of 'bettering' the Federation by eliminating an enemy. 

For Picard as it is, it feels like the showrunners went back to the 'galaxy in danger, going to be destroyed by overwhelming force' plotline that Disco used in S2. The Picard we've seen in TNG isn't one to quit and retire when he's presented with no options. Granted, years have passed, things have changed, but the undertaking he was pressing for was so massive and dire that I'd be hard-pressed to believe he'd take the Federation's reticence with such ease and allow for conditions to worsen while he takes retirement on his family vineyard. 

(Not to mention the villains have been a bit too mustache-twirly, or evil for the sake of evil. And I do understand the reasoning of protecting the galaxy from synthetic life, but the Romulan sister has only one note to play, and that's ""let's kill people and enjoy it"".)

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Again, there are some aspects I like about Picard, but it seems to be following a very beaten path. I'd like to hear other people's opinions as well.","What happened to Picard being a slower, contemplative show?"
1,"So I was a defender of this show earlier on. I saw some flaws with it but I also saw it’s potential. As time has gone on I feel like that it’s been slipping more and more into being a disappointment. Now I know that there will be those who disagree with me and I welcome their thoughts. If anyone has opinions that makes more sense of things then awesome. I know some of these posts get a little heated so I just wanted to try to welcome open and civil dialogue up front. Anyways here are some of my criticisms on episode 9. 

I’m having trouble with this new Soong. The entire reasoning for Nooniens devotion to the creation of Data and his brothers was to combine his passion for developing synthetic life and his need for having children. He even referred to Data as his son. It was even established that he was unable to have children with Datas mother Juliana. So the only way that this could make sense is if Noonien had a son with a woman before Juliana and they had a falling out. That he had lost all touch with him and longed for another father/son connection. However, with their shared passion for synthetics and the passed down knowledge of the craft to Altan, this seems unlikely. They introduced Altan so casually and took no time to try and make sense out of how he fits into what we knew. I mean surely Data would have known of him. Data always had a desire to find family connections but described feeling alone because his options were slim to none. It also bothers me that every generation of Soong looks exactly the same. I know it’s a way to keep Spiner involved but the huge implausibility of it is difficult for me to ignore. Also that all of them would share the same interests and skills. I don’t know, it just feels out of place and random. 

The whole Sutra using a mind meld business is a bit sketchy for me too. I know that Spock mind melded with a machine before but the act of initiating it appeared to be an ability that only a Vulcan, or at least someone with Vulcan genes, possessed. The idea that a synth could just teach themselves how to do it is a tough pill to swallow.

Dr. Agnes Jurati also feels like one of the most inconsistent characters in Star Trek history. One moment she’s smiling and is the comedic relief, the next she’s crying and in emotional anguish. During a lot of her goofiness she’s supposed to be carrying a vision so traumatizing that she said she thought about killing herself as an escape. First she’s a huge synthetic proponent, then she becomes a spy with orders to kill Maddox and Soji as well as helping the Romulans track Picards movements. She has a change of heart and disables their ability to track them but then confesses to still thinking that even the possibility of synthetic life must be destroyed before it’s too late. One brief conversation with Soji later and now she’s back on board with helping synths. Now in this new episode, even seemingly to the point of assisting them in wiping out all biological life in the galaxy. At first I thought she was playing a ruse to make the synths trust her but then Sutra gives her the lie detector test which concluded that she was being truthful. True it still might be some kind of ruse but it’s still a bit jarring considering that just a couple of episodes ago Agnes was talking about how all synths must be destroyed.

This whole ending with the synths actually being the destroyers feels like a strange direction. What a crappy legacy to leave Data that his children are all so willing to commit mass genocide. It also makes it really confusing who are the villains and who we should be sympathizing with. At first it felt like the Romulans plight was sympathetic because they got screwed over but then they were the antagonists. The same can be said for the synths. I’m not sure who I’m supposed to be rooting for at this point. Both parties seem pretty bad. Having the Romulans being right to fear the synths also doesn’t seem like the most Star Trek message. Star Trek at its core is about hope and acceptance and this show appears to be veering wildly away from that. Every time Picard tries to argue the ideals of Star Trek then he’s ignored, berated and told to shut the f*ck up. It’s like the writers of the show are actively choosing to dismantle the soul of the series.

Also what ever happened with “Data’s entire code, even his memories, could be reconstituted”? Shouldn’t all of these synths have Data’s knowledge and experiences? Aren’t they carrying his essence? It makes it feel all the more hard to believe that they all jump on this let’s kill all organics bandwagon.

And what the hell is up with the space flowers lol? That is so random and seems pretty impractical. How do they work? Why wouldn’t a group with highly advanced technology not develop a more practical defense against their enemies? I’m not just a fan of seeing a giant space battle of Romulans versus flowers haha.",Episode 9 “Et in Arcadia Ego” thoughts
1,"Just wanted to comment on this. She's a really deep actress. That conversation with her was extremely compelling. She puts a lot of thought and passion into her acting!       

I love Wil and how passionate and open he is about being a huge nerd, love you Wil! But damn that was a good interview. I usually feel like younger actors just kind of wing things and focus on themselves, but Isa was totally into it. And her acting as Sutra was really intense.      

I like seeing people seriously passionate about their careers. She went way beyond just ""I'm making it up as I go along"" and really put serious thought into it, to the point she could have a fun and energetic conversation with Wil about her acting. And we know he takes his roles really serious and totally nerds out on them. Major props?",Isa Briones in The Ready Room interview with Wil
1,"They don't have hooked noses, they don't have sloped foreheads, they don't wear hats or robes, they don't have dark curly hair, thick eyebrows, or beards, or any hair for that matter. They're not a diaspora, but mainly stick to their own planets and their own ships, only venturing out to trade.

Unless there's something I'm forgetting, the most often emphasized way in which they are dishonest and exploitative in their dealings isn't usury, it's that they seek trades that are unbalanced in their favor. They're described mainly as traders, not loan sharks.

If the 285 Rules of Acquisition were a satire of the 613 Commandments of Judaism, one would expect it to have more rules, rather than fewer. They would balk at Judaism's matrilineal tradition, as well as Orthodox Jewish women's garb, and their general misogyny reflects many human cultures. Every alien race in Star Trek has exaggerated facial features in proportion to how ambitious their makeup is, the Ferengi just happen to have the most extreme makeup of any recurring Star Trek alien.

From what I can tell, greed is more or less the only major Jewish stereotype that legitimately applies to Ferengi. But if you took nearly any other Star Trek aliens, made them greedy capitalists, and then squinted at their other characteristics as hard as people squint at Ferengi, you could just as easily cherrypick Jewish stereotypes.

Klingons are dogmatically religious. Vulcans are also dogmatically religious, and have a tacit hegemony over Federation culture in spite of constituting a minority of the population. Romulans are secretive and conniving. Betazoids have arranged marriages, and Lwaxana Troi is a Jewish mother stereotype if I ever saw one.

And I really hate to say it, but you know who actually do deserve some criticism for being a racist stereotype? Klingons. Violent, rapey, hot-headed, savage, tribalistic, hard-drinking aliens who were portrayed almost entirely by black actors once they stopped being played by white actors in blackface. They went from being as cringey as Drow to only being almost as cringey. But no one complains about that because everyone loves Klingons.

And there's a lot of potential in the Ferengi to explore social issues in ways that would represent the best of Star Trek. I'd love to see the Ferengi reform story arc from DS9 followed up on.

Remember, when last we checked, the Ferengi ideology was lightening up. Ferengi women could finally wear clothes. Once female Ferengi technically have rights, but still tacitly face a lot of cultural prejudice on their homework, it seems inevitable for a fair number of Ferengi women to run off to Starfleet Academy. It would be great to see a female Ferengi bridge officer in a future Star Trek series.

But know what the most depressing part is? The real reason I think that's never going to happen:

*There is no catsuit in the galaxy fanservicey enough to make a Ferengi look sexy.*

That's the real problem: for once they went all-out with the makeup and made the Ferengi look legitimately ugly and inhuman. And Trekkis aren't as open-minded as they like to think, so they concoct a reason not to want to see those grody snaggleteeth, preferably one that sounds woke.

And that's why we'll never see a female Ferengi bridge officer bucking her sexist culture. We'll also never see the Ferengi try to pull a 180 and do Fully-Automated Gay Luxury Space Communism, but wind up reinventing Stalinism instead. We'll never see any of the interesting directions you could take the Ferengi. We'll just get another pale Klingon thrown in for plausible deniability. It's really sad.","The Ferengi were never an anti-Semitic stereotype, and the accusation that they are actually says something pretty depressing about the fandom."
1,"OK so guys hear me out, I don’t know if this is the right place for this but here I go.

I’m 17. My first contact with the Star Trek universe were the new movies and, despite liking them, I always knew that there was much more to explore in the story.
I’ve always wanted to watch the whole thing, but life can get in the way some times. So, I turned to my father’s collection of VHS tapes. He is a Star Trek fan. I’ve watched a lot of stuff with him, but I have to admit I love TNG. I’m not nearly close to finishing, I’ve only watched a couple of episodes but I could not be happier in finally devoting time to this series.
Although, while watching the first season I’ve been thinking about how much I might be missing by not starting with the original series. There were a couple of references and the appearance of DeForest Kelley already, and sure I can pick up on something, but it’s not the same.
The problem isn’t that I don’t like TOS, quite the contrary, it’s just that I like watching TNG too much. I love the cast, I love how creative they get with the writing. And I just like Data too much.
So, I’d like an opinion. For someone who is new to everything, should I keep on going with TNG? Should I watch other stuff before? What do you think?
