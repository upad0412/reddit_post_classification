StarWars,"Full disclosure - I'm not fully aware of all the OT lore in the comics/canon books. After seeing the Clone Wars finale and knowing that Ahsoka was alive past ROTJ - is it possible that she met with and helped train Luke between ESB and ROTJ?

Luke levels up quite a bit between those movies and I don't think he is trained by Yoda during that time (unless there is some other non-film canon explanation for how he gets so much better with the force.)

It would be sweet to see them interact somehow, or with some of the other OT/ST characters. Can't wait to see what they do with her in live action.",Theory: Does Ahsoka help train Luke?

StarWars,"Post contains spoilers for Star Wars Rebels and Clone Wars!


I've been seeing a lot of hate towards rebels recently, specifically the art, however, there are others commenting on the ""trash plot"", ""dull characters"" and a range of other criticism which I personally feel the show doesn't deserve.

Rebels is still Star Wars and it's a great piece of canon that really helps show what the empires reign was like in the early years. It is packed with exciting moments that are arguably more memorable than a lot of the memorable moments in the clone wars (with exception of season 7), such as Ahsoka vs Vader or Ezra and Thrawn disappearing into the outer rim somewhere and especially the development and final moments of Maul. 

Rebels art style isn't even that bad, it's just not as good as the clone wars. The only major flaws in the artwork was Yoda, Hondo, Anakin and Bo, Everything else was fine if not good. Rebels was our first ""Canon"" introduction to how brutal Vader was in the time between ROTS and a new hope, yes there was filler but what show doesn't have filler in it. The filler isn't even that bad because it further explores the star wars universe or introduces new characters.

The hate that Rebels is getting is unjustified in my opinion and it is potentially putting off people who haven't seen it. It is still prequel era and holds a lot of emotional weight for fans of the prequels or the clone wars as well as further develops much loved characters and shows hints of the true powers of Vader and Palpatine.",Rebels is still a good show despite its faults.
StarWars,"I once had a friend claim that Maul is just as evil, if not, MORE evil than old Sheev. I pondered that notion, but had to disagree. Here's why:

Maul knew nothing besides violence and bloodshed from the day he was born. He grew up on the ruthless planet of Dathomir, and was recruited by Sidious at a young age. The ways of the Sith melded naturally with the warrior ways of male Dathomirian tribes. He never really had a chance to be anything but a killing machine. He grew to tfavor the Dark Side because it granted him the ability to reach the top of any hierarchy he desired, crowning him as the alpha among all of his peers.

Contrarily, Sidious was raised in a Royal family on the peaceful planet of Naboo. He was naturally drawn to positions of power, and sought out knowledge of the mythical Sith. He initially wasn't influenced by any outside force. He just thirsted for power. He wanted to sculpt the galaxy how he saw fit. Darth Plagueis discovered him because of his immense Force sensitivity and proclivity towards the Dark Side. When Palpatine trained under him, his ambition was unmatched. He didn't ever feel discouraged by his failures; he used them to fuel his anger. This is why the Dark Side came so naturally to him. He hated anyone who stood in his way to absolute power, and viewed everyone else as pawns; including Plagueis. He even slaughtered his entire family in a fit of rage. He was a legitimate psychopath, relishing in manipulating others and seeing his schemes come to fruition. More potent than his strength in the Force, was his ability to speak. This is how he was able to rise to power so quickly in the Republic. There was nobody he couldn't manipulate. This gift of deception is what gave him such a massive edge over past Sith. He was a mastermind. No other Dark Sider was able to infiltrate and hijack the central government of the galaxy. Furthermore, he purposefully ruined the lives of trillions of people to further his own agendas, inuding Anakin Skywalker.

Even Maul didn't feel the need to take over the entire galaxy. He was content with ruling the Outer Rim through his crime syndicates. Maul also valued family, as seen with his alliance with Savage Opress. Not only that, he seemed to even actually have _some_ respect for the Mandalorians, and the cultural similarities they had to his own people. Maul was a warrior, and Sidious was a politician. The former used violence to achieve their ends, while while the latter used deception.

I'm getting into The Clone Wars for the first time, now that it has ended and has so good critic. I know mostly everything that happens, but I'd like to experience the best moments of the show. So far I've watched a few episodes of the first season.  


I'm not particularly interested in small ""side quest"" stuff, of the type ""Ashoka learns a lesson"", and I completely love the army and politics side of the conflict, also the big plot developments (Darth Maul in Mandalore i.e.) Given that... Would you recommend me to watch all of the series? Or just handpick a few chapters? I'm guessing that seasons 5-7 are to be watched in full, but I'm clueless on where to start, what to omit, etc. Help appreciated.

StarWars,"Just a fun thread but if you could make a full length movie trilogy out of Clone Wars arcs which ones would you use? You can either draw out existing arcs or combine some to make one movie. It could also be a fun way to introduce people to Clone Wars that don't have time forna 7 season show but I digress.

I'm watching the show for the first time right now and I just got to the Mortis arc and I couldn't stop thinking about how this arc plus the Nightsisters arc would make for a fantastic 2nd movie in the trilogy. Maybe end it with Dookus attack on the Nightsisters and Savage finding Maul (both season 4) and that would be awesome. Maybe the first movie could end with the the Obi Wan season 2 Mandalorian arc to set up Deathwatch for the final movie and Anakin could be doing either the Senate Hostage Crisis or the Zillo Beast?

It would have been hard to add anything too great to the OT bc of technology issues.

If they started cloning just after the end of the clone wars (ended in 19 BBY) There would be a 29 year gap, it’s easy to imagine tha the kaminoans needed some time to get their organisation back and running.

StarWars,"

With the finale of the clone wars it’s easy to assume that darth mauls story moves on to rebels where he perished. I think there is at least one more major event for him, here is why.
Order 66 happened on 19 bby, that is when maul was last seen escaping the republic ship

Maul died on 2 bby in the twin suns episode of rebels. This gives us a seventeen year time span to work with.

 In the movie solo he told Qi’ra to come to Dathomir where they will work closer together, this was after he gave her all of Dridons stuff in the crimson dawn so it is likely that other crime syndicates are going there too. Solo was estimated to take place on 10-13 bby leaving us with 7-9 years left on mauls life left. 

Maul was likely planning something big including his crime syndicates however in rebels he was working seemingly alone to activate the sith super weapon ( correct me if wrong only read the wiki about it ). So what happened with the crime syndicates? If he did use them he would have brought mercenaries or bounty hunters

Instead I think his access to the crime syndicates were severed or someone took over ( Qi’ra story? ) this leaves a lot of possibilities for possible Darth Maul stories to tell.

StarWars,"Listening to Filoni talk about how he always had the finale in his head over the years since it was cancelled, to me means that it was pitched to Kennedy long before a decision to make rebels was made. 

So she was totally wrong not to finish TCW first. The finale was brilliant. 

Rebels could have received a much better promo stage leading up to its release.

Just a thought. But how can you leave Kennedy in charge when she definitely knew what the last season of TCW was going to be and shelved it. 

Who in there right mind would decide not to make filonis pitch? 

Filoni has done great but I bet he was a tiny bit upset he had to do rebels first. Which means maybe rebels could have been even better,imo, just bc Filoni was probably a bit disgruntled right around the time she shelved his baby.

StarWars,"Hey, this is just an idea that came up to me yesterday about a different way Revenge of the Sith could have went and I wanted to share...

Anakin would train to be a Jedi Knight by Obi-Wan, therefore honoring Qui-gon's request. He would become a great warrior and known as a hero in the clone wars, although hotheaded. He would be assigned Ahsoka, to be his padawan, and she would grow strong and kind. Maul would still be spared by Sidious. Anakin would grow a friendly relationship with the Chancellor, seeing him as a mentor. 

Here where some changes would happen: Anakin would not have felt in love with Padmé right away, although they would have a thing for each other. So most of Anakin's love was to his Padawan. When she was expelled and then pardoned by the Jedi Council, her decision not to return to the Jedi Order would break Anakin's hearth. 

When the battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan against Dooku happens, the Jedi capture the Count with the help of Master Yoda. Dooku is imprisoned and questioned to reveal the identity of the Sith Master. 

Sidious is tremendously worried about the capture of Dooku, since he knew that the Count will reveal his identity, but Sidious would need help killing the Count, since his death would put the Jedi Council in high alarm, making them know that the enemy was very close and further making the Jedi suspect him. So he cames up with a plan.

Sidious gets to Maul in Mandelore, gives him the locations of Ahsoka (he has spies tracking her), and haves her poised by Maul. Maul obeys, and after a fight with Ahsoka, she is poisoned.

After hearing the news that Ahsoka was found  misteriously ill and in danger of dying,  Anakin feels powerless and guilty for not being able to help her. When he tell this to the Chancellor, he reveals himself to Anakin as Darth Sidious, and promisses that if he joins him, they could save Ahsoka together, with the power of the Dark Side. Anakin agrees and pledges himself to Sidious and the Sith orders Anakin to kill Count Dooku, and prepares to command order 66. 

At the same time, the Siege of Mandalore is happening, leaded by Bo-Katan, who asked the Jedi order for help, and was rejected. Only Obi-Wan comes to her aid secretly and against orders (a very Anakin thing to do), for wanting to end Maul for good and revenge Dutchess Satine. Obi-Wan kills Maul, and I'm his last breath, he tells that Skywalker is the key to all this, and he was forced to play his part with the poisoning of Ahsoka, starting the grand plan of the Sith. As Mauls still wants revenge against his old Master, he even tells what is the antidote to Ahsoka's poison. 

Anakin kills Dooku and Order 66 happens, killing most of the Jedi. Darth Sidious personally kills the Jedi Masters at the Council to show Anakin the power of the Dark Side, and fights Master Windu.

Basically only Obi-Wan and Yoda, since Obi-Wan wasn't with clones and Yoda felt it, escaped and went to Coruscant. Obi-Wan was on his way to Coruscant too, to tell Anakin's of his findings and report Mauls death. 

After the landing of Obi-Wan in Coruscant, he finds about order 66 when the clones try to kill him, so he fights and sneaks to he Jedi Council to find the Chancellor killing Mace Windu and Anakin watching. Sidious orders Anakin to kill Obi-Wan, turning him in a true Sith. Anakin and Obi-Wan start fighting, and Obi-Wan tells that Maul was who poisoned Ashoka and he knows the antidote. Sidious says he's lying, but Anakin believes his Master, and after connecting 1+1, understands that's the poisoning was ordered by Sidious himself. Obi-Wan and Anakin fight together against Sidious, but when he was getting the upper hand, Yoda shows up and helps them defeat the Sith, but dies of his injuries. 

They cure Ahsoka and flee from Coruscant together, with the entire clone army looking for them.

General Greivous takes control of the clone army (image Greivous way more like in the Tartakovsky series). The 3 Jedi make a final push against Greivous, since they had located his base in Utupai prior to order 66 and Yoda told them the location. They engage Greivous and manage to defeat him, at the cost of the sacrifice of Obi-Wan' life to save Anakin. 

Anakin (who later would marry Padmé) and Ahsoka then become the faces and leaders of the Resistance, who fight to free the Universe from an old Sith legend who used the disturbances in the force to rise again and take control of the Clones... A Sith legend shrouded in mystery and tragedy...",Alternative ending to Revenge of the Sith
StarWars,"I really enjoy the clone episodes in TCW, but a friend of mine recently brought up a good point. In AOTC, they are described as “completely obedient, accepting any order without question.” Yet, this isn’t what we see in the show. Especially in the Umbara arc, the clones are questioning Krell’s orders. Heck, we even have a traitor and a deserter in the show. How does this line up with what we heard from Lama Su? 

I’d like an in universe answer if possible, I understand it makes for a much more interesting show when you have the clones this way.",Why were the clones in The Clone Wars not as obedient as they were described in Attack of the Clones?
StarWars,"So I just finished the Mandalorian and I’ve watched TCW and most of Rebels, both of which have lots of Mandalore and Mandalorians. The first thing is that Don Djarin says that he cannot remove his helmet but in the two aforementioned shows pretty much any Mandalorian you see is seen without their helmet on. As for the second point, in Rebels S4 Sabine says that her armour is 500 years old and has only been painted and slightly reforged so why is it that in the Mandalorian, Din replaces any piece of armour, excluding the helmet, like it’s no big deal.

While these are only small points it does annoy me as under Disney it feels like that there is no definite explanation for things as the new films and shows have basically retconned certain things and ideas that happened pre-Disney.",Why has ‘the Mandalorian’ rewritten some Mandalorian lore?
StarWars,"Before I start, I bet lots of people have said things before that I’ll bring up in this post, but coming off of may the 4th I decided to write a post about Star Wars. 


I was born in 2005. I never got to experience Lucas’ movies in theaters, but my parents were huge fans of Star Wars. My mom said she was just waiting for me to be old enough to watch Star Wars for the first time. When I turned three, she decided I was ready. She popped in the 1995 vcr version of a new hope, and I was hooked. Over the next couple of days, three year old me had finished all of the movies, and after that I watched at least one of the movies a day, according to my parents. 

Lucky for me, the clone wars movie was coming out in a couple months. It was one of the first movies I watched all the way through in theaters. I would watch the clone wars episodes when it came out, I had tons of action figures, all I talked about was Star Wars. 

For the past 12 years of my life, I have always loved Star Wars. I have been introduced to other things, like Harry Potter, hunger games, and more, but even then I still gravitated more to Star Wars. Half of my room is dedicated to only Star Wars related things. 

I recently got to rewatching the entire saga, and there is something about Star Wars that nothing else has. While I can go and talk about the issues with the sequels and the writing of the prequels, when you watch them it’s still Star Wars, and when I watch them I forget about The issues I have with them. 

When I watched the final episode of the clone wars I was filled with sadness that it was over, and I went back and watched revenge of the sith, the movie I have the most connection with since I watched it the most as a kid. As I watched, I felt like a child again. I completely forgot about the troubles I was having in school and with friends, and just was lost in the movie. 

Star Wars is one of the only things I can watch to take my mind off of the things that are happening in my life, and the only thing that’s I will love no matter how cheesy the writing is or how blatant the plot holes are. Thanks to the series that made my childhood.",Why I love Star Wars
StarWars,"I've always been a big fan of Rex, I watched Clone Wars on and off since it began and the last season was incredible. I always knew about the theory he was on Endor but I never knew it was basically confirmed until the other day. 

Filoni said how it could be him but he wouldn't confirm it and just get rid of Nik Sant. There's also the animation that shows Rex on Endor with his gauntlets.

If he shows up in The Mandalorian with Ahsoka then I will lose my mind. He would definitely be old but I've been saying for a while that he's been a soldier all his life so I'd imagine he keeps in as great a shape as possible. 

Also, maybe he finds a way to slow his advanced ageing. I'd love for more of Rex to be explored in books or something!",Rex's story is now one of my favourites
StarWars,"Let me start by saying I absolutely loved this final arc. Dave Filoni is a creative genius and mastermind; I’m so glad that he and everyone involved finally got to give us the finale to possibly the best Star Wars content this century. Everything from the character moments to the story to the animation to Kevin Kiner’s score is nothing short of breathtaking. It was everything I could’ve hoped for and more. 

All of that said, I’ve come to quite a dilemma...

I have owned the *Ahsoka* novel by E. K. Johnson (published 2016 and declared canon) for quite some time. As I’m sure many others who own the novel have noticed, there are many discrepancies between the novel and the Siege of Mandalore arc.

Some things are minor: a few dialogue changes between Anakin/Ahsoka and Maul/Ahsoka (which could easily be explained as “maybe we just didn’t see their whole interaction”), Ahsoka’s sabers being green while on Mandalore (not as easy of an explanation here, but I’m willing it to let it slide), etc. 

Other things, however, are much more impactful in my opinion: the fact the Rex, Wolfe, and Gregor all have their inhibitor chips removed before the Siege, the fact that Order 66 occurs while Ahsoka and Rex are still on Mandalore, the details in capturing Maul, etc. 


Now, I completely understand that retconning happens all the time in media and entertainment. Things are changed and life goes on. However, as someone who cares (or at least used to care) deeply about Star Wars lore and canon, this doesn’t sit quite right with me. Why would Disney blatantly go against their own established canon here?

Of course, the answer is likely that Dave Filoni was not satisfied with what the novel gave us and wanted to show us his version.

This just feels odd to me after months of Disney and the “Story Team” telling us “The Rise of Skywalker novelization has tons of answers in it! Read it! Buy it! It’s 100% canon!” (Obviously I’m not actually quoting someone here, but you get the idea) Is that novel really canon though? Why is that one and not the *Ahsoka* one? Should we believe that canon only matters unless they come up with a better idea and change it?

It’s equally bizarre when you consider a whole new line of “canon” books are on the way about the High Republic... will those just get retconned by a new show too?

Again, I cannot stress enough that I love what happened in the arc. I am in no way trying to criticize Filoni’s work or lessen what he has done. In fact, I am **happy** with the changes - I like what the arc showed better than the novel! As a fan, I’ve just been almost completely dissuaded from caring about canon now if it can just be thrown out of the window with a flick of a finger. 

I mean, at the end of the day, does this really matter? Probably not. It’s just a retcon that has minimal impact as a whole. At the same time, will I continue buying “canon” books to try and learn as much as I can about Star Wars...? Eh, probably not.",Regarding established canon and Ahsoka [SPOILERS]
StarWars,"Outside of comics we haven’t really seen anything like this and it would be a good opportunity to explore Vader’s character immediately after revenge of the sith (outside of comics) while also exploring the transition period of republic to empire from clones to storm troopers which we never get shown a proper transition of. 

Idk but in terms of films/tv series i always felt there was a barrier splitting the two eras apart and i wish something was shown to organically connect the two more properly  ya know? 

Like show when palpatine decided to retire the clones and their reaction idk. 

This could also be a good opportunity to flex Vader’s power like in rogue one since live action vader won’t be held back by technology like he was in the OT.

StarWars,"I think this would be a great idea, especially after The Clone Wars. It could explain why Anakin feels Obi-Wan is too limiting, Obi-Wan stepping up to the role of Mentor and Jedi Knight, especially after Qui-Gon’s death. Obi-Wan probably made some initial mistakes when just becoming a Jedi Knight. It could also revolve around Count Dooku as a Jedi and the reasons for his fall, and show Palpatine’s father figure role and influence on Anakin at a young age. It just feels like a good era for more material.",Why is there not a show about what happened between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones?
StarWars,"I'm very mixed on The Last Jedi. It has higher highs and lower lows than The Force Awakens. For everything I love there's something I hate. But I have never gotten the criticism of the ""Holdo Maneuver"". Keep in mind the only novels I ever read in either continuity are Tarkin and the Aftermath Trilogy. But based on the films and TV shows nothing was contradicted. TFA showed hyperspace jumping involves going into a wormhole. So when I first saw that scene I figured the attack made sense. If you jump too early you go to your destination, too late and you crash into the ship doing minimal damage (as seen in Rogue One), just the right time it becomes a weapon of mass destruction. 

I can't think of many instances where the maneuver would've been useful in the past (I imagine the Death Star had a stronger hull than the Supremacy). Plus Hux's reaction in the film indicates to me this isn't something Holdo invented so the criticism ""why has nobody done this before"" doesn't seem valid.

The real problem is, I don't think he understood what Luke Skywalker meant to people in the real world.

Favourite film: Revenge of the Sith.

-

Overall, the most entertaining Star Wars film for me. We see how much our characters have grown and how their relationshps have evolved. It has comedic moments, great action set pieces and goes to really dark places (Order 66). 

-

Least Favourite: The Last Jedi.

-

This movie was a mess. Slowest chase seen in any movie, useless casino side plot, flying Leia and a regression of Luke's character journey.

-

Favourite Hero: Obi-Wan Kenobi (He just rules). He is the epitomy of what it means to be a Jedi. He defeated Darth Maul, Genreal Grievous and Anakin Skywalker.

-

Favourite Villain

-

Count Dooku. I loved that he never fully delved into the dark side, just for political reasons. It's cool that he was Qui Gon's Master. He was also Yoda's apprentice.

StarWars,"I’m always shocked that there have only been like 1 or 2 Star Wars fighting games and it is really sad. I prefer 2D fighters, but I’d even be fine with a full fledged game based of PS2’s Revenge of the Sith.

There are so many archetypes that would be fun to play with for these characters. Luke would be the all rounder character that has a little bit of everything. Vader would be the brute who could do some serious damage. Obi-Wan would be a strategy character based around techniques and spacing.

I honestly don’t care if it they have lightsabers that don’t rip limbs in one hit, I’m used to fighting games where people throw fireballs at each other and brutally pierce other people’s bodies with no major impact on the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

The end of series 7 of The Clone Wars definitely shows us the Siege of Mandalore, but in The Mandalorian, Moff Gideon also references it:

""*Or perhaps the decommissioned Mandalorian hunter... has heard the songs of the Siege of Mandalore, when gunships outfitted with similar ordnance laid waste to fields of Mandalorian recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.*""

The siege itself doesn't seem to go on for multiple days; the episodes flow pretty quickly from Ahsoka's arrival to the end of the siege and it doesn't seem any more than a day. Seems odd that there should be a singled out incident called ""The Night of a Thousand Tears"" in such a short conflict (unless it's another name for the siege itself?).

I thought there might be another siege post Order 66 in which Concord Dawn is half blown up (as we see it in Rebels), but then I realised I was confusing it with Concordia in Clone Wars...

What are your thoughts/what details am I missing?",Were there two Sieges of Mandalore?
StarWars,"at the beginning of TROS, Kylo gets a Sith Wayfinder from Darth Vader's castle on Mustafarr, there's honestly a problem with Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder, but I'll give my explanation for why Vader had a Sith Wayfinder: 

Vader had a Sith Wayfinder at his castle, meaning he somehow acquired it (Palpatine probably gave it to him to guard it sometime between ROTS and ANH), Vader probably didn't know what it was (Palpatine probably didn't trust Vader with the knowledge of Exegol and his clone body), so he most likely tried to secretly learn more about it (because this would be a so Vader thing to do), eventually learning it's a map and leads to a place called ""Exegol"", Vader would of wonder what his Master was hiding there (he'd know it'd be something important enough for him to not be informed about), so Vader would've followed the coordinates on the Wayfinder to Exegol (to see what his Master had there, cause if it was a powerful weapon, as Vader didn't  fully trust Palpatine at this point), once there, he'd have found Palpatine's cult and Palpatine's clone body, just waiting for Palpatine's soul to eventually go in it, Vader would of quickly realized Palpatine's plan, to send his soul into this clone body when he dies, so he can live longer, Vader would of then left Exegol (not destroying the clone body and killing Palpatine's entire cult, as to make sure Palpatine would never learn he was there) and never tell his Master about him having went to Exegol, and decided to keep his Wayfinder hidden in his castle. 

this is just my explanation on why Vader had a Sith Wayfinder in the first place, now for the problem of Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder; 

Force Ghost Anakin spoke to Luke a lot after ROTJ (and before Luke's exile), so wouldn't have Anakin told Luke about Palpatine's clone body at Exegol and tell him to go to his former castle (when he was Vader) to get the Sith Wayfinder to go kill Palpatine for good this time, or better yet (something related to my explanation), couldn't Anakin just tell Luke where Exegol and let him go finish the job, unless the Sith Wayfinder would actually allow Luke to properly get to Exegol without any problems getting there. 

what do you guys think of any of this though?",the most likely reason with Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder and the problem with him having it.
StarWars,"Ok, so I haven't seen Rise of Skywalker or Mandalorian yet, and I've only watched half of Solo. I've seen Force Awakens a few times and Last Jedi once, but almost two years ago. Trying to figure out the best watch order to kind of recap and see what I haven't yet to get the best lead up to RoS. As much as I'd want to just watch them all again I will be skipping 1-6 this go around. Should I just go straight release order, or not break up the new trilogy with RO and Solo ? Also, should I do Mandalorian 1-7 before RoS, than finish it after?

I know this is asked a lot and I've been looking at a ton of different threads tonight but couldn't find any real discussion on breaking up the new trilogy with RO and Solo as well as watching RoS inbetween episodes 7-8 of Mandalorian. 

Thanks for the input!",Weird dilemma here on a viewing order
StarWars,"I really am interested in creating a dark, deep sequel trilogy, I want to make an alternate trilogy. No details are set at all at the moment I am just jotting ideas down, but i'm looking for a group of 5. Three story creators including me which will discuss everything required to create a 3 part arc, and 2 talented artists who are willing to create amazing concept art work based off whatever we create in the story.

Reply in the comments if this resonates with anyone. No disrespect to anyone but I want people who are dedicated and passionate and know star wars, and understand majority of the extended canon outside the movies.",Alternate sequel story and concept art *My creation
StarWars,"So correct me if this was mentioned or hinted at in the Clone Wars final season and I missed it or the Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir comic (I haven't read it). 

But I've been thinking a lot about the Clone Wars final season, particularly the last arc and how it connects with RotS. During the marketing, a lot of the creators and outlets advertised how it would ""change how we see RotS"" and while, don't get me wrong, The Siege of Mandalore is incredible, arguably the best arc we've got for the show and one of the best pieces of SW content we've received in years, it didn't really change my viewing of RotS. Both pieces of content still felt very distinct from each other and while CW added to the film, that was it. Maul and Ahsoka still felt too distant (and I know they were because they were retroactively put into the series, I just mean diegetically in the universe it still felt that way)

Something as well that's always bothered me about RotS is the opening. The Battle of Corruscant is a great set piece and reintroduction to world, for sure, but when it comes to character motivations, if this was Palpatine's plan why not earlier? Or later? Why at that point? And what was the point of it in the end? Seemed like a very convoluted way to kill off Dooku and...thats it's really. The events that followed lead to the ALMOST death of him by Mace Windu and ALMOST betrayal by Anakin (when he informs Windu of Palpatine being Darth Sidious). It all just seemed very confusing. Until I started looking at it from a certain point of view....

Palpatine has a vision. He sees Mandalore in flames. He sees the fighting between the clones, blue and white coated Mandalorians and hellish red and black ones as well. He sees Maul fighting Anakin and Obi-Wan in the throne room, their lightsabers colliding, and he sees the rage and the determination that Maul fights with. Finally, he sees his future apprentice cut in half by his former. Palpatine awakes from his vision and grows afraid. ""Whatever Maul is going to do cannot come to pass. But how do I stop it?"" He thinks cautiously before scowling. Things need to be fast tracked. Reluctantly, he pulls his hood over his rage filled eyes, retrieving his holoprojector before activating it. In front of him, the blue shimmer of a deformed, metallic being with yellow piercing eyes bows before him. ""What is thy bidding my master?"" He asks with his raspy electronic voice, his words sputtering as he coughs violently. ""The time has come earlier than anticipated, General. It's time you came to Corruscant and payed the Chancellor a visit"" Palpatine replies with a crooked smile. 

I believe Palpatine enacted the Battle of Corruscant, and thus the following events of RotS as a power move against Maul, a reaction to either a vision or intel he had received about Maul's plans. And I love it. It explains so much about RotS in my mind. Why Palpatine played it so close, almost dying and losing his new apprentice. Why he didn't deal with Obi-Wan, Anakin's metaphorical father figure and biggest risk to his upcoming Empire's most powerful figure in the form of Darth Vader. It also makes Maul a key figure and much more integral to the story, rivalling and stirring Palpatine without us even realising. 

My theory is probably wrong or at least a bit far fetched, but I like to think that this was the case. I think it makes RotS so much more exciting, and makes CW so much more important in the overall story of Star Wars. I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you agree/disagree? Why? Either way, I hope I've allowed some of you to think both pieces from a different perspective",Theory: Did Palpatine know that The Siege of Mandalore was going to happen?
StarWars,"When rewatching AotC, I feel that we could have skipped TPM entirely.  Bear with me on the plot.

Episode I:  Qui Gon and Obi Wan are sent by the Jedi to rescue a lost Jedi named Sifo Dias in the outer rim on the planet of Tatooine.  The Jedi stumble upon a young slave boy named Anakin who help them navigate the area.  QuiGon also notices two adult twins (foreshadowing) working as slaves with the boy.  Boy shows talent with the force and QuiGon is keen on freeing him.  Waddo rolls dice and Anakin manipulates it showing he is willing to abuse his use of the force in his favor.  After investigating, Sifo Dias is believed to be dead after stumbling on evidence of a separatist movement on Geonosis.  Evidence is found and the Jedi go back to the council on Coruscant.  Jedi believe that this evidence is important and sends it to the Senate.  Senate, led by a young politician named Padme, suggests new elections be held for new leadership.  Padme suggests every system scrounge up forces to go to Geonosis to confront the small separatist movement.  Qui Gon and Obi Wan travel to Geonosis for recon.  Find a massive droid army being built and confronted by Sith (Darth Maul or Dooku).  QuiGon dies, Sith escapes, republic ""fleet"" arrives too late to catch the separatists and their army.  Ends with uncertainty and the reveal that a young politician named Palpatine was elected as the new Chancellor.

Episode 2:  The separatists have attacked and several systems are falling.  The republic fleet is overwhlemed.  The Chancellor is given emergency powers to do whatever he can to turn the tide.  Obi Wan has taken Anakin as his Padawan.  Padme is being hunted by the separatists and Anakin AND Obi Wan are sent to protect her.  Obi Wan notices romance brewing between the two and warns Anakin not to get too involved.  Palpatine requests that the Jedi go to Kamino to look into a promising cloning facility that may be the key to creating this grand army.  Reluctant and not liking Palpatine's command, the Jedi send Obi Wan since they would like the keep the Jedi on Coruscant close to the Chancellor.  Obi goes and Anakin and Padme have alone time.  Obi finds that Kamino was commissioned by an unknown source to clone humans for slave labor.  These humans have worked on the out rim colonies for years but was kept hidden by certain politicians.  It is this slave labor that led the separatists to want to leave the Republic.  Kamino says that these slaves can be reprogrammed as soldiers for the Republic.  Obi Wan attempts to reveal this information to the council but is too far away.  He calls Anakin and is attacked by Sith midspeech.  Anakin and Padme travel to Kamino to help ObiWan.  Fearing Sith is there to take over the cloning facility for the Separatists, ObiWan, Anakin hunt for Sith while Padme is tasked with blowing up the cloning facility.  Fight ensues, Obi and Anakin cut off the arm of the Sith who still escapes.  Obi and Anakin discover battle plans that from the Sith's missing arm that the Republic Fleet has been destroyed.  Padme, Anakin, and Obi all agree that the clones are a necessary ""evil"" and defuse the bombs to the cloning facility.  Again, uncertainty concludes.  The Jedi meet with the Chancellor revealing the slave intent of the cloning facilities and demand they be shut down immediately after the war is over.   Palpatine agrees acting ""surprised"" that slave labor was present in the Republic.  Jedi also insist that they personally command the clones.  Palpatine agrees.  Closing shot of clones putting on helmets, brandishing weapons, and loading into Star Destroyers.  Begun the Clone Wars have.

Thoughts and critiques?","Anyone else feel that AotC had enough plot to be split and becoming Episode 1 and 2? (Plots rewritten, long reads)"
StarWars,"1. Empire strikes back
Up there with the best sequels ever new locations, original story, Yoda is introduced the showdown luke has with Vader, the trials that luke goes through &gt;! And fails giving us a concluded cliff hanger !&lt; Its all great.

2. Revenge of the Sith
I know not what you expected? Let me explain myself this is Star wars, the darker story was great and the new locations &gt;! Showdown with Annikan and Obi-Wan at the end !&lt; Was such a climatic ending to George Lucases fuck up of Star Wars prequels the dark story felt so fresh and new and not too poorly presented.

3. A new hope
The first classic star wars movie great movie a classic the plot although recycled 3 times was amazing and it is truly a masterpiece. The relationship that develooes between Han and Leia &gt;! Ben Kenobisdeath carryed so much weight !&lt; Amazing movie

4. Return of the Jedi
I absolutely love this movie I have watched it too many times to count, great conclusion to Georges Masterpiece &gt;! The scene where Vader saves Luke !&lt; Was so unexpected when I first watched it my only critique was the Ewoks looked like shit.

5. The Force Awakens
As you will later find out I hate the Disney sequels but this one got me fucking hyped. Although they basically recycled new hopes plot I loved it. I wasn't expecting &gt;! Hans death !&lt; Which caught me completely off guard. While it isn't perfect &gt;! The plot hole for how does Poe get off Jakku !&lt; And some other stupid stuff I enjoyed it. I wish in the later films they developed Reys character more but sadly it never happened.

-------------Below this line are the films I didn't like------------------

6. Attack of the Clones
We'll what can I say? Cheesy as fuck romance scenes with Annikan shit acting Annikan is annyoying as fuck and the films CGI in some places looks like shit. Good stuff: the fight scene with Yoda and Count Dooku was awesome, all the scenes with the clones where amazing and thats about it.

7. Phantom Meanace
What I didn't like: 3 Words Jar Jar Binks and the CGI in some places looked shit, acting in some places was just awful the end where &gt;! Qui gon dies !&lt; Was a great intense fight and duel of the fates never gets old. 

8. Last Jedi
Holy shit I hate this movie, theres so much stupid scenes that didn't need to be in this film. Luke drinking titty milk, why? &gt;! He says he's not gonna face down the first order with a ""laser sword, which he does anyway !&lt; And the scene where &gt;! Leia fucking Mary Poppins flies into the space ship is laughable !&lt;  The start with the slow bombers is completely unnecicerary they are literally &gt;! Killing people for the sake of it !&lt; Don't get me started on the choriography it is complete shit.

9. Rise of Skywalker
The entirevfilm is a muguffin chase that makes no sense. The bit where Rey calls herself &gt;! Rey Skywalker !&lt; Is fucking insulting and it is the most perdictable movie I have ever seen. &gt;! Oh Chewies dead, no he's not it was a differant ship! !&lt; And the plot is a recycled shitty version of Return of the Jedi. &gt;! Leias death makes no sense, she died trying to communicate with someone using the force? Its implied in the OT that she is as powerful as Luke! Wtf !&lt; &gt;! The plot with Palapatine back is fucking lazy, stupid and makes no sense !&lt; 

Thats my ranking, sorry I know I literally tore some of your favourite movies to pieces please understand this is purely my opinion feel free to disagree and disguss with me your thoughts on the movie.","My ranking of the main star wars movies, what's yours?"
StarWars,"Rewatching the prequels for May the 4th got me thinking would an older Anakin have made the prequels better? I actually really enjoyed this rewatch more than I expected. In my opinion it’s heart is in the right place and though I always liked the prequels there is definite room for improvement.

I’m not sure how often this has been brought up but I think that an older Palawan Anakin at the start of episode one would be a good idea. I think that overall this would help with the character progression of Anakin as well as his relationship with Obi-Wan, as well as hopefully reducing his “whininess”. My plan would be to age up his maturity, both physical and emotional, by half an episode.

Episode 1: Anakin is a young, headstrong Padawan recently assigned to Obi-Wan. They are dispatched to a seemingly simple mission regarding trade dispute, appropriate to their skill as a new knight/padawan team. I want to keep Qui-Gon in the picture so maybe he could be introduced shortly after the mission goes pear-shaped as an experienced master. Overall, I think that nothing was gained by making Anakin a young child at this point. All of his slave backstory could be established through dialogue and his limitless potential could easily be established as a padawan. By the end he is still headstrong but more to the level we see mid episode 2, this sets a foundation that allows for more adult growth come episode 2.

Episode 2: Basically the same as the original version but he is now early 20’s and handles things with more experience. This way his headstrong nature comes out in a more appropriate way as legitimate opinions and plans of action from a capable Jedi, rather than the unasked for opinions we actually got. This could also help with the stunted romance that we see by making him an old friend of an appropriate age to Padme, rather than a boy doting on a woman. By the end Padme and Anakin are two young adults fresh from hardships taking solace in each other, and Anakin and Obi-Wans relationship could be one of mutual respect and understanding like we see at the start of episode 3.

Episode 3: Very little changes here. Mostly we see a change that better reflects what Anakin would have gained and lost through constant war if we already establish Anakin as a man the episode prior. He is now a strong, grizzled leader that feels like what the clone wars series helped establish. With Padme I think this too would bring about a better feeling of eminent fatherhood that felt more like a high school pregnancy in the actual movie. This allows Anakin to truly devote more time to the growing darkness, and introspection that would eventually turn him into Vader.

So what do you think? Overall, I think one of the greatest boons to this alteration would be allowing for more onscreen growth as opposed to growth between episodes. I wanted to try to voice a theory that required as little alteration to the movies as possible because, as I stated earlier I really do appreciate the heart of the story established in the prequels.",What would you think of aging Anakin up at the start of the prequels?
StarWars,"TLDR at the end. Obligatory apology for mobile formatting
With The Rise of Skywalker now on Disney+ I’ve been able to rewatch it since it’s release and have a few thoughts. 

My list of critiques (I am a Star Wars fun and even if I sound harsh it comes from a place of love):
There were too many unresolved plot points (hints at Finn being Force sensitive, Rose, rise of the First Order, Anakin’s lightsaber being repaired, and Finn/stormtrooper thing)
Palpatine shouldn’t have returned in the flesh but instead the First Order enacts his backup plans
No forced kiss. I didn’t get a romance vibe but more of a friendship that was based upon Rey wanting to give Han and Leia back their son
Instead of spending half the movie fixing the mistakes, own up to them! Yeah you goofed. Own it and move forward. 

The Force Awakens is my favorite of the Sequels. Even though a lot of it is A New Hope 2.0 they made a real story with new characters and it is undeniably Star Wars

The Last Jedi has my irking for a while I will admit. But a YouTuber named CinemaWins made my grow a small appreciation for the things that were good. I think overall it was meh (I mean that in the weirdest decently bad but good way) movie with some nice sections I enjoyed. 

Now the Prequels, I’m sorry but I am a Prequel lover and no small part of that is due to the age I was when they came out. I was an in upper elementary school and an extension upon some old movies I really liked was coming out? Of course I’m gonna go watch them. I didn’t have any problem with these movies until I was in high school but even then I saw more good than bad. The actors killed it in their roles even if the dialogue in Episode 2 was bad. Revenge of The Sith is an amazing movie with excellent scenes and much improved writing.

Original Trilogy got me started so I will always love it. Enough said. 

Overall my love for Star Wars isn’t diminished. I will always buy a ticket to a Star Wars movie. Am I disappointed, yes. But at the end of the day I still love all of these movies and despite glaring issues, while watching them the first time I was filled with that joy and wonder I did when my cousin handed me a box set of the Original Saga on DVD, Attack of The Clones, and Revenge of The Sith when I was 9 years old. 

TLDR: Even though there are issues, my love for Star Wars hasn’t and will never change. These movies are all good in their own way and even if to some they are mostly bad because they are Star Wars.",I just have a few thoughts I wanna share about the Sequel Trilogy and Skywalker Saga as a whole
StarWars,"I don’t know if this has been done before but what if Palpatine wanted Anakin to lose to Obi Wan on mustafar. This would mean that he can no longer be as powerful as he was meant to be which means he cannot overthrow Palpatine. Also, most of the galaxy knew Anakin as he traveled all around fighting in the clone wars and so the whole galaxy would have known that Darth Vader is just Anakin Skywalker who has suddenly become the emperor’s monster. It really seems like something Palpatine would do given the way he treated Maul and Dooku.",Maybe Palpatine wanted Anakin to be defeated at the hands of Obi-Wan on mustafar
StarWars,"Something that's been bugging me recently, after the death of Darth Bane, the Jedi believed the Sith were no more, and had never heard from them until Maul appeared in Episode I.

This means that any Sith Lords or legends from Bane to Maul would be unheard of by any Jedi, and as such, I doubt anyone in the Jedi Order would have even heard of a Sith Lord called Darth Plagueis, let alone how he died.

So when Palpatine says ""it's not a story the Jedi would tell you"" I assumed he was trying to sow further mistrust between Anakin and the Jedi Council, but you can't really get annoyed at your superiors for not teaching you something they aren't even aware of themselves can you?",The Jedi couldn't tell Anakin the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise!
StarWars,"So I just finished season 7 of the clone wars. Don’t get me wrong I think it’s brilliant how they put this together.

However In my opinion the inhibitor chip stuff just feels.... cheap. I remember the first time I watched episode 3 and felt so shocked at what had happened. I assumed the clones built a close bond with the Jedi when really it was  just a facade, just another protocol they were told to follow until the new order came down. That’s what made episode 3 so impactful to me. Come to find out after watching clone wars that it’s all due to a little chip in their brains that just turns off their connections with Jedi in order to hunt them. 
Idk it just doesn’t hit as hard for me as before. Although I suppose in order to do this final season, they had to find a way to turn off some of the clones per say.

What do you guys think about it?",Anyone else feel weird about the inhibitor chip story line?
StarWars,"With the finale of the clone wars it’s easy to assume that darth mauls story moves on to rebels where he perished. I think there is at least one more major event for him, here is why.
Order 66 happened on 19 bby, that is when maul was last seen escaping the republic ship

Maul died on 2 bby in the twin suns episode of rebels. This gives us a seventeen year time span to work with.

 In the movie solo he told Qi’ra to come to Dathomir where they will work closer together, this was after he gave her all of Dridons stuff in the crimson dawn so it is likely that other crime syndicates are going there too. Solo was estimated to take place on 10-13 bby leaving us with 7-9 years left on mauls life left. 

Maul was likely planning something big including his crime syndicates however in rebels he was working seemingly alone to activate the sith super weapon ( correct me if wrong only read the wiki about it ). So what happened with the crime syndicates? If he did use them he would have brought mercenaries or bounty hunters

Instead I think his access to the crime syndicates were severed or someone took over ( Qi’ra story? ) this leaves a lot of possibilities for possible Darth Maul stories to tell.

Thank you for coming to my tedtalk. I really like Maul and his character so I want more stories and I want to hear other people’s thoughts",Maul Theory. Spoilers for season 7(?)
StarWars,"With the disappointment of the sequel trilogy and with this quarantine not looking to be going away for some time, I decided to try and flesh out a well developed, new Star Wars script. 

This will take a long time, and will go through multiple iterations but will be a continuation of the sequel trilogy but hopefully with a better overarching story and better character development. 

Is there any ideas or things you wanted to see in the recent sequel trilogy, or general ideas you have about cool things to put in a new script. 

This could be settings, people, story arch’s, plot points etc. I have a rough idea about what will happen but I wanted to know if there’s anything I could take inspiration from, based off your wants and needs. 

Let me know :)",I am currently in the early phase of writing a script for a new Star Wars Movie...
StarWars,"Let me start by saying I absolutely loved this final arc. Dave Filoni is a creative genius and mastermind; I’m so glad that he and everyone involved finally got to give us the finale to possibly the best Star Wars content this century. Everything from the character moments to the story to the animation to Kevin Kline’s score is nothing short of breathtaking. It was everything I could’ve hoped for and more. 

All of that said, I’ve come to quite a dilemma...

I have owned the *Ahsoka* novel by E. K. Johnson (published 2016 and declared canon) for quite some time. As I’m sure many others who own the novel have noticed, there are many discrepancies between the novel and the Siege of Mandalore arc.

Some things are minor: a few dialogue changes between Anakin/Ahsoka and Maul/Ahsoka (which could easily be explained as “maybe we just didn’t see their whole interaction”), Ahsoka’s sabers being green while on Mandalore (not as easy of an explanation here, but I’m willing it to let it slide), etc. 

Other things, however, are much more impactful in my opinion: the fact the Rex, Wolfe, and Gregor all have their inhibitor chips removed before the Siege, the fact that Order 66 occurs while Ahsoka and Rex are still on Mandalore, the details in capturing Maul, etc. 


Now, I completely understand that retconning happens all the time in media and entertainment. Things are changed and life goes on. However, as someone who cares (or at least used to care) deeply about Star Wars lore and canon, this doesn’t sit quite right with me. Why would Disney blatantly go against their own established canon here?

Of course, the answer is likely that Dave Filoni was not satisfied with what the novel gave us and wanted to show us his version.

This just feels odd to me after months of Disney and the “Story Team” telling us “The Rise of Skywalker novelization has tons of answers in it! Read it! Buy it! It’s 100% canon!” (Obviously I’m not actually quoting someone here, but you get the idea) Is that novel really canon though? Why is that one and not the *Ahsoka* one? Should we believe that canon only matters unless they come up with a better idea and change it?

It’s equally bizarre when you consider a whole new line of “canon” books are on the way about the High Republic... will those just get retconned by a new show too?

Again, I cannot stress enough that I love what happened in the arc. I am in no way trying to criticize Filoni’s work or lessen what he has done. In fact, I am **happy** with the changes - I like what the arc showed better than the novel! As a fan, I’ve just been almost completely dissuaded from caring about canon now if it can just be thrown out of the window with a flick of a finger. 

I mean, at the end of the day, does this really matter? Probably not. It’s just a retcon that has minimal impact as a whole. At the same time, will I continue buying “canon” books to try and learn as much as I can about Star Wars...? Eh, probably not.",Regarding established canon and Ahsoka [SPOILERS]
StarWars,"First off, I don’t want to start a battle over people’s preference of the sequel trilogy over any other movies/tv episodes. Also, I’ve never read any of the novels so perhaps it’s been discussed there but not on screen. This is what I’m enquiring about. 

In TROS we saw(on screen) for the first time a ship being pulled out of the air by the force by Rey. In TCW S07E12 Ahsoka does the same thing. 

I remember seeing TROS in theatres thinking that scene seemed rather like a “jump the shark” moment. It was really cool, but nowhere had we ever seen this, or anything close to it, done by a Jedi or Sith. It seemed rather “overpowered” for what a force wielder could do, based on what we’ve seen them do before on screen(as well as the force healing and Palpatine disabling an entire fleet with lightning - very cool but never seen before). And then Ahsoka goes and does the same thing. 

I can’t help but think that they had Ahsoka do this only because of the events in TROS(since TCW was released afterwards) in an attempt to make what Rey did seem plausible. 

Was there ever any mention in the novels of Jedi or Sith being able to pull ships out of the sky prior to TROS? At the same time was there any mention in the novels about force healing prior to TROS?",Clone Wars S07E12 &amp; TROS vs All Others
StarWars,"I wanted to know you guys thoughts on this. I think one of the most underrated pros of Hayden’s Anakin was how smooth he was in lightsaber combat. You can tell he is exceptionally athletic and coordinated. I was an all state wide receiver, played a year in college, and I still can’t find myself imitating some of the moves that were done in the movie. He had a flow that none of the other actors had in the prequels. Literally every fight between Anakin and *insert name here* was mesmerizing to watch and I find myself going back time and time again to watch them on YouTube just to figure out how he did some of it. Now I’m sure hollywood has plenty of other actors that are equally athletic, but he just had a flow to him that, like I said before, is mesmerizing. 

I just don’t get what people didnt like about him and it’s sad. He LOOKS like a perfect anakin. This was a comment I stole from YouTube but totally made sense, but his facial expressions in episode III just looked like pure evil. I think the exact comment was when he wasn’t talking (due to the bad scripts) he had the most intimidated presence of anyone on screen. I find this very true. The scene after he kills the separatist and his eyes turn yellow. Evil. The scene after Obi Wan tells Padme he is “so sorry” and anakin is looking at the lava river on mustafar. Pain. The scene when he starts crying in the chambers. Pain. He captures the emotions perfectly. Like PERFECTLY. 

I just really want to see a comeback with Hayden. I don’t care if it’s 2 minutes of screen time, he just embodies Star Wars for me. I grew up with him, and I don’t think there will ever be anyone more special to me in all of Star Wars. 

And lastly, if this ever gets to Hayden Christensen, I’m sorry for the way you were treated after the prequels, I’m sorry how bad Kathleen Kennedy treated your for the sequels, and there are literally MILLIONS of people who would give their left nut for you to make a return as Anakin. And I think I speak for the majority of the Star Wars fan base that we all love you. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk",Hayden Christensen appreciation post
StarWars,"It pains me a bit to know we’ll never see Grievous capturing the Chancellor from Coruscant. I can imagine the Separatists arriving out of hyperspace, or something, into the atmosphere. Then bunch of droids and Grievous ambush the senate building or smash through the Chancellor’s chambers windows, where he’s at, and snatch him. It pains me not to see the effect on the galaxy right after the droids were shut down... 

nevertheless, I really like how it ended. It was personal, and it needed to be. Order 66 was seen in ep 3 on such a macro emotional level and for it to been shown on a micro level, is something I didn’t even think about it. The end is still emotional to me, in some weird way, and that’s literally never happened before after consuming a piece of ~~entertainment~~ art. A mix of nostalgia, melancholy, hopelessness. The music absolutely added to this strange feeling. It too was an odd mix. It was score you heard in ep 3 and music you hear associated with dark force users. Uncertainty, darkness, sadness. Dark Maul and Asoka, for me, quickly changed from being characters I never cared much for, to becoming some of my favorite in the entire saga. The both grew and developed and were the Clone Wars creations. The characters, including Rex, didn’t exist until the show started. Sure Maul did, but he died and was never really had a personally anyway. It’s only fitting that the three get their ending together. 

Great job David. I hope this guy can direct some movies in the future.","I thought the Clone Wars would end differently, but I’m really satisfied with how it did -also the the music."
StarWars,"There's some things I know about their species that I remember from the guide to Star wars species book I'm not sure how much of it is still Canon. 

Their home planet is a grassland planet. On their planet they're still primitive and live in tribes.even though their planet was discovered a couple thousand years ago they still haven't joined the republic.Their culture is somewhat conformist and showing individuality is a taboo.

 The markings on their face and head tails and sometimes other parts of their body evolved as a way to camouflage them from predators.

 The race is very social and if they're forced to spend time alone they often suffer from depression and extreme anxiety. They also like live prey and like to eat insects and small rodents.

They also rarely leave their planet unless they are recruited by the Jedi order.this causes some people to believe that all members of their species possess the force.",I was wondering how much of the original backstory behind Ahsoka's species of the Togruta is still Canon. Here are some things I remember about her species from the Star wars guided species book.
StarWars," I think Barriss is CRIMINALLY underused. She was shown to be incredibly intelligent, memorize the entirety of genosian tunnels. Plan the bombing and almost get away with it, see the flaws in the republic that the Jedi couldn't. And shown to be very powerful in the force, being able to defeat Asajj and Ahsoka, and put up a relatively good fight against Anakin. Having her blow herself up like what was originally planned would be such a waste. I really hope we can see her make up with Ahsoka (cause lets be real she is the only acceptable ship for Ahsoka). It was also mentioned that she wouldn't be an inquisitor because even if she was against the jedi, she wasn't evil and still had good in her. (said by Dave Filoni)",[SPOILERS] Barriss Offee
StarWars,"I don’t know man, they were just so underwhelming to me. Do you think this was a stylistic choice; I.e. it’s these are fairly young force users in a time where being a swordsman was unheard of? Or do you think it could be just lazy writing/choreography on the directors side? Or could it be something else entirely? All I know was that I was very disappointed by the direction in these last 3 films. Hopefully going forward, away from the skywalker saga, we can get back to our bad ass fights circa the prequel era.",Who else thought the lightsaber battles in the sequel trilogy were mediocre at best?
StarWars,"So while watching the Rise of Skywalker, there is a scene where Rey is saying goodbye to Leia before she goes off to find the Wayfinder. In this scene Leia tells Rey to never be afraid of who she is. Rey seems to read Leia's face and there is a shared look between the two. This made me think back to the Last Jedi when Luke meets Rey and spends basically their entire time hesitant about who she is exactly and he seems to be highly suspect about her nature in the Force. 

You see, I think that Luke and Leia knew that Rey was the genetic descendant of Papa Shiv. Maybe not like, Bing she a Palps, more like they could hear the echos of his hatred and connection to the Dark Side screaming at them through her. This would satisfy both while Luke was harsh with Rey at first then warmed up to her and it would also explain while Leia would take a direct active hand in her training. At the beginning of Rise to Skywalker, Rey is attempting to connect with the Force Ghosts of the previous Jedi who were still connected to the Force. I would assume that this was done at Leia's direction after potentially speaking with Luke's Force Ghost. 

This means that Luke and Leia would have had to been casually aware of Palpatine existence. This would also explain why Luke left looking for the secrets of the Jedi, found something that damaged his calm and forced him into exile. What was that something....maybe a crisis of faith ala Dark Empire encountering the spirit of the Emperor. 

I swear this movie gets better every single time I watch it.",Did Luke and Leia know that Rey was a Palpatine?
StarWars,So near the end of Rise of Skywalker there is a fight between Rey and some guards and Ben and the Knights of Ren. Rey uses some sort of force deflection to throw blaster bolts at some of the guards. The scene cuts to Ben fighting. When we come back to Rey they use the same shot of her deflecting bolts. It looks identical to me. I watched it a few times. Then I tried to Google it and there are a million articles about the ending being reused. So many that it would be impossible to write an article about an actual reused shot. Anyone have any insight on this? Did you notice the shot too? Did Disney make a smoke screen to hide their mistake?,Rise of Skywalker rewatch.
StarWars,"Hey Reddit,

I'm doing a University assignment and I'm looking into the future of CGI from a fan's perspective. I'll be asking multiple questions on different subreddits and trying to identify patterns in responses. If you have any examples of poor CGI in the franchise I'd love to hear and I'd also love to hear your thoughts on what you think the future holds for CGI in the Star Wars franchise! I also know that the franchise has completed most of its films but some thoughts would still be appreciated!

Thanks!",What is the future of CGI in the Star Wars franchise?
StarWars,"I have loved Star Wars my entire life, and especially always loved The Clone Wars. 

But Episode 9 singlehandedly made nearly every single sacrifice any hero made from 32 BBY (The Phantom Menace) to Anakin's final act to balance the force completely meaningless. Every war fought throughout the known Star Wars saga has lost all it's weight, as the rightful climax of the series in Episode 6 has been retconned;  Palpatine never died.

I don't know if I am the only one who feels this way, but I just feel like the heart of Star Wars was Anakin's arc, and now I can't seem to enjoy that arc knowing that it doesn't actually accomplish anything in the long run. These fantastic Clone Wars episodes just don't feel the same even. Anakins struggle is now less realized, and even though the the fall of the Republic is coming, none of it even matters in the long run.

 Every single choice in Episode 9, mainly Palpatine's return and Rey being a Palpatine, just made the entire Star Wars galaxy feel incredibly small and insignificant, cheesy even. And now I just can't seem to become invested in this beautifully lived in, galaxy again after what JJ did to it.",I can't enjoy The Clone Wars because of Episode 9
StarWars,"Spoilers for those who haven't seen tRoS:





So with D+ finally getting RoS yesterday and rewatching it for the first time in the theater over the winter, I got to wondering about the voices that Rey hears during the final fight with Sheevs... 

We now know who's talking to her and most of them make sense, Qui-Gon, Kenobi, Ashoka, Luke. Others have me scratching my head, why would Luminara, Aayla, or Adi be included with them being such unknown Jedi and minor characters in TCW (I had to look them up even though I just finished the series re-watch)? Even Kanan is a bit of a stretch IMO. 

Is there a reason those three were included? Where they special in any way that wasn't made clear in TCW, something I missed?",Why Rey Heard The Voices She Did?
StarWars,"What if instead of the storyline we had, tros plot really pushed rey’s fall into darkness while also showing kylo rising. Ok hear me out guys.

Rey is indeed a nobody. Her parents abandoned her on jakku because they were either afraid of her abilities or whatever might come of it (or maybe they just didn’t want her).

Kylo’s still struggling with the light and guilt of killing his father, and the soon death oh Leia starts to push him towards the light. 

Rey isn’t a palpatine but could instead be plagued by visions or apparitions of the late emperor pushing her towards the dark side. While pulling away from her friends and the rebellion as a whole as she starts to dive deeper into who she truly is.

There is a huge power struggle within the first order and the generals as they feel kylo isn’t truly wanting to work towards the goal they were hoping for.

And it all boils down to Rey vs kylo in the end where Rey unfortunately loses the battle in the end

This is just a Skelton idea but it’s been on my mind a lot and I would just like to tell someone my idea for how the movie could’ve been. I just think if instead of being the stereotypical “good guys win the end” type of movie it would’ve been a lot more interesting if they really pushed Rey to the dark side and made her go full ‘Empress Rey’ in the end. Just think about how interesting it would’ve been if we followed this character that we’ve grown to love (or at least some people have) and seems altruistically good but turns out to be the opposite due to outside forces (maybe somewhat like the Anakin arch). It would’ve definitely made a lot more sense than what we eventually got (in my opinion) and it would’ve cleared up a lot of the confusion about the whole palpatine situation (which c’mon how are you going to bring him back to life off screen?) Kylo had a steady arch throughout the whole trilogy so it would make sense that he would be the meaning behind “the rise of skywalker” instead him just turning good in the 3rd act of the film and Rey just saying “ok I’m a skywalker now”. 

I get it’s Disney so there’s probably money and politics behind the direction they decided to go with this film but it’s just an idea I had and I would love to hear other people’s opinions.

P.s I know I could’ve elaborated a little more so let me know where I should",Rise of skywalker alternate plot
StarWars,"The original trilogy just isn't that great, especially compared to the prequels. 

Luke is a pretty boring character, as are Han Solo and Chewbacca. The rebels, and their fight scenes, are also boring. There is little character development. The action is just... meh. The only shining light is the relationship between Vader and Luke. 

The prequels aren't perfect, but they're comfortably more interesting plot-wise and character-wise than the OT. Anakin is compelling, as are Obi-Wan, Sidious and the clone war plot generally. 

Revenge of the Sith is comfortably the best SW movie, and I don't think it's particularly close...","I have just rewatched the first six Star Wars films. The original trilogy, barring the relationship of Darth Vader and Luke, is boring as hell."
StarWars,"I think there are number of times where it might be of note that Episode 4 uses the idea of families having arguments or small arguments as part of it's over all story structure. It makes it more relatable and interesting. It seems that it would follow a pattern of fear (threat) first, followed by the nullification of  the fear, followed then by anger (I'm using these terms lightly in the context of a fun adventure). I'm aware of and don't discount the euphoria felt by the characters after some of the instances of the nullification of fear.

Here's some that I can think of:

Droids with Death Star plans almost get caught, they get away in the escape pod, they're arguing in the desert

Luke attacked and overtaken by the the sand people, rescued by Obi-Wan, technically arguing with Kenobi by resisting to go to Alderaan

Luke almost gets wasted in the cantina, saved by Kenobi, leads to arguing with Han Solo

Millennium Falcon and crew being chased by the Empire, escape by going to into hyper-space, Han arguing with both Luke and Kenobi about the Force.

The Falcon being taken by force into the Death Star, Han's quick exchange with Kenobi when they emerge from hiding (or their arguing in the small command module room thereafter)

Leia's threat of execution, Darth Vader options to not do it, she's arguing with Han during detention center shoot out.

The heroes almost get smashed in the compactor, they escape from this, Leia arguing with Han - and Chewbacca little

StarWars,"When I first started watching the Clone Wars, I was excited to find out how Anakin got the scar over his eye. I started with the Clone Wars movie, and when I started it, he already had it. We are told how he got it, but I was extremely disappointed that we didn’t get to actually see it happen. There’s also other things that happen between the two that I think should be addressed, like the the introduction of Asajj Ventress. And it just dove directly into the fighting. I really want stories on things like Rex an Cody being assigned to Anakin and Obi-Wan, and everything else in between. Does anyone know of anything where this area of time was established or is it all just up in the air?

StarWars,"Hey guys! I was watching rebels today and I stumbled across something that got my gears turning. Can anyone confirm if this is true? Or already canon.

So as we know Jaro is a Lesat male who was among the few Jedi to made use of a dual blade. 

The double bladed saber was originally a sith design. It was made popular by Exar Kun, The Inquisitors and Darth Maul (all dark side users) and the Jedi Temple Guard (one light side exception). The weapon itself was designed to help the user excel in fights against other lightsaber users (and deflect blaster fire however you could achieve the latter through the use of two single sabers) with the risk of hurting ones self oftwn outweighing the reward, so using double sided sabers was frowned upon by the Jedi order. 

The order encouraged the use of a single lightsaber or two single bladed lightsabers, bearing one in each hand. While it was not unheard of to wield a double blade, it was exceptionally rare. The temple guard can be justified as they would be the most likely to encounter another combatant armed with a saber. Also at the ""end of their shift"" for lack of a better term, the saber was passed to the next rotation so it was never the temple guardsmens personal weapon. 

So why was Jaro Tapul allowed to make an exception and gave his personal weapon be a double sided sabre?

I think I stumbled across the reasoning in an episode of my Revenge of the Fifth binging of Star Wars Rebels...

In Rebels Zab, Another male Lesat carries with him a weapon called a bow rifle. This looks alot like a double sided electrified spear (like you see Grievouss guards have) and slightly resembles a double bladed sabre. He mentions that this is the traditional weapon for the warriors of his people..

And there we have it. 

I believe Jaro would have been accustomed to wielding this type of weapon prior to his entrance to the order in the first place, which is why the order allowed him to make his own sabre a double blade. Not only would he have had the training to ensure he was safe, but he also trained with a double weapon without the malicious intent of bringing ones demise. Also a jedi weapon is meant to be an extension of one's self, and by making his saber a double blade and tying it back to his people, he did just that.",Why I believe Jaro Tapul was allowed to practice with a double sided light sabre...
StarWars,"...would Rex still have survived the Siege of Mandalore/Order 66 arc?

I'd say it's pretty likely that Rex was always meant to overcome Order 66 and protect Ahsoka as he did in the arc, simply because it's such a strong storytelling experience. Filoni never got to wrap up this loose end before TCW was cancelled, and later on reintroduced Rex to Rebels to, among other reasons, reveal the fate we never got to see onscreen.

Do you guys think it's possible that, if Filoni never established Rex's fate for Rebels and instead TCW finished to the end, Rex would've died at the end of the Clone Wars - sacrificing his life for Ahsoka's? It certainly would have made the arc even more tragic and poignant: Rex would be buried among Jesse and his brothers while fighting for different causes, and we would've seen Vader's reaction to finding out that his clone captain, one of his best friends, died as a result of his actions.",(Siege of Mandalore speculation) If Dave Filoni and his team didn't make Rebels first...
StarWars,"The Taika Waititi announcement originally had me... concerned?

I like some of the MCU, Captain America, black panther and Spiderman homecoming I think are really good, and it's because they're different. I think the fact that most of the movies are set in the same sort of futuristic present, and also have very similar plots, really makes it hard to get excited for each movie. A lot of the time the plot goes: the characters are introduced, the conflict is set up, the villain looks like winning until some reveal/surprise at the end turns the tide. It also takes away from the rewatchability, for the reasons I said before, plus skipping some doesn't take away much from the overall series. Star Wars on the other hand, even if you don't like some of the movies, you can't really skip any and still understand the main saga.

I think one of the strengths of Star Wars is that there are only 11 films. It makes you really keen for each new movie. Even though some of the movies (ANH and TFA for example) are similar in some ways, watching them doesn't feel like I've seen this story fleshed out 10 times already.

As for more Star Wars content, I think the Disney+ series are a great idea (besides the Cassian one, but we'll see it might turn out to be good). I really like how the Mandalorian has a different style (samurai/western), and I think it would be great if each different series has its own style, while still being connected in some way to the main saga.

TL;DR I don't want to be oversaturated by the same kind of Star Wars movie 4 times a year, because that will just take away what's special about Star Wars to me.",I really hope Star Wars doesn't turn in to Marvel
StarWars,"In the last few episodes of Clone Wars, Maul seems more powerful with the force than normal. He invades Jesse’s mind, redirects blaster bolts with ease, and shows off incredible feats of telekinesis while dodging countless blaster bolts on his rampage through the Star Destroyer during Order 66. Now, it’s possible that Maul is normally capable of such feats. But at least from what I remember, he has never shown this level of power before or after. Since all of this happens at the end of the war and during order 66, the time when the dark side of the force was at its strongest, what if that gave Maul a tangible boost in power?",[Spoiler] Theory about Maul
StarWars,"Ok, so I must admit (and don't tear me down here) but Star Wars has never really taken my fancy, OH watches it, and I might get a bit of it, whilst I do other things, mainly looking at my phone or pottering about the house. 

After he watched the newer release this evening, we were talking about it, and then I actually showed an interest (for the second time, my first interest got side tracked with other things, that I thought were much more interesting) 

Anyway I digress... 

We were talking about the order in which the films were released, and my mind is blown, I cannot get my head around why you would intentionally make a 3, 4, &amp; 5 to release a 1, 2 &amp; 3 and then 6, 7, 8 with a 3.5 thrown if for good measure somewhere in between. 

So, I guess the question really is, if you were to know somebody, who wanted to watch the entire set of films, which way would you recommend it is done? 

The order of release or in order by number? 

Or am I so far behind now, that there really isn't any point and will I be disappointed for wasting so much of my time, even if we are in a lockdown with not much else to do? 

TL;DR Never seen Star Wars, not sure if I want to, but if I did, in which order should I watch them?

They let you hear the voices of the Jedi masters and anakin, but only let you see luke and Leia. Of course im a prequel person, but they could have made us prequel people happy, by showing us the original Jedi masters one last time. And how Rey is just able to use dark side force powers by doing almost nothing, is shit. Also when palpatine, I guess sucked the force out of Rey and Ben, didnt kill them immediately, makes no sense.

She has the best quality of a great Jedi even though she doesn't she herself a Jedi. The last episode of TCW really shows how a Jedi should act even in the most darkest and pressing time.

StarWars,"Most of the liea talk and scenes drive me nuts bc they are basically made after looking at the film they had of Carrie fisher and then writing the story. THATS WHAT THEY DID! the idea should have been scrapped immediately and rewritten with her death offscreen. 

The very beginning was so forced and erratic I’m just embarrassed. It’s almost bittersweet considering we got taika now. Boom! 

When they show up to the festival there is nothing that happens and then all of a sudden Skype call and chase. Oh and let’s throw in lando and force a “I got a bad feeling about this” and then a cringe “never underestimate a droid”

Then the “they fly now” turned into a stupid cgi crash. After the mandalorians final sequence it is absolutely unacceptable! 

While the first 40 minutes of TFA was the only movie, maybe rogue one, that held anything to the originals, I’d say the first 40 minutes of ROS is absolutely terrible! 

And FINALLY the knights of ren, yet not really bc you Barely see them. 

I really hope taika is able to do what I think we all wanted and mix what was great about the prequels and originals. The sequel has nothing to do with the prequels at all and no sign of them. What the mandalorian did with the clone wars flashbacks was perfect. 

I really hope we see a completely new story weather it goes back, (the Jedi mandalorian wars mentioned in clone wars, rebels and the mandalorian could be cool) or something in the future but I would like it to be a high point of the Jedi so we get the vastness of new places, characters and action that the clone wars style proved everyone can dig! 

So just so not to confuse everyone it’d be prolly more prequel style but hint at the OT enough. You have to imagine what most fans were thinking going into the prequels. The disappointment with the phantom menace was it was nothing like the originals. But the clone wars showed us how great the prequel era really can be. 

I couldn’t imagine getting something like the clone wars finale back in 1999 when the phantom menace is all we got. That’s the perfect mix of all the Star Wars, it really was and can be used a beautiful blueprint for the future of Star Wars. 

They should be able to tell an incredible story thru one or two trilogies and some spinoff arcs similar to the best clone wars arcs. Maybe in ten years were spitting out 2 then 3 Star Wars a year like marvel.

One was the Emperor at a temp agency, which still cracks me up to this day, and there was a trilogy of ""deleted scenes"" of Ben talking to Luke at different points throughout the movies.

Beginning in 1999 with the Phantom Menace, and now ending with Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the past 21 years of prequel content we have received is extraordinary. From George's prequel films to his idea that would be the Clone Wars movie and show. This era of Star Wars carries more weight with me, than any other. From the retcons of lore (the clone inhibitor chip) to the building of character that wasn't available in the movies (Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan, etc.), to the numerous games and music (thank you John Williams, and Lucas Arts) that were all spawned from these past 21 years, I can only look upon these years as a Star Wars fan with delight, and admiration. The Clone Wars has revolutionized Star Wars, and hopefully it is a revolution that will continue with the Mandalorian season 2 coming up.

However, there are still Star Wars fans out there that haven't been able to have this experience that I, and many others have experienced. I implore you, those that did not watch the Clone Wars, to do so now. Now that is it has ended, and we are in isolation, there is no better time. To go back, to a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, one cloaked in turmoil and deceit. Where actions of heroes on both sides come together to make a story unlike any other.

StarWars,"The episode shows Ezra entering a Jedi Temple which is essentially in between time and space. He is able to save Ashoka from dying in the past and brings her to the present. Imagine if Palpatine got hold of this temples power, he could have pulled out a dark side Anakin before he got his limbs cut off. Or Obi-Wan could have pulled out an light side Anakin and challenge Palpatine. Yoda could have gone to the past to warn the rest of the council of Palpatine before it was too late. So much potential of new stories from the temple and yet I have seen little to attention to it at all.","Has anyone realized the amount of potential and new timelines the Rebels Episode ""Wolves and a Door"" has created"
StarWars,"Hear me out, nostalgia could be a factor as this was the first Star Wars film I saw in theaters at age 10 in 2005. It blew me away the and it still blows me away now. The opening sequence is one of the most exciting scenes in all of Star Wars, a huge epic space battle turns into to two heroic Jedi fighting their way to rescue the chancellor. An epic light saber ensues and it’s great. The final act in this movie so about the last hour cannot be beaten nor will it ever be beaten in terms of Star Wars. The duels, emotion, the tragedy, it’s all done perfectly. And of course it’s fun. Although empire strikes back is the better made movie it’s not as fun for me as revenge of the Sith.",Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie(yes even better than empire)
StarWars,"I may just be tired of star wars at this point because the rise of skywalker left me feeling so empty, but this left me so unimpressed. There are some decent ideas in this, but they never do anything interesting or creative. The plot is insanely predictable, i pretty much guessed the entire thing as it progressed. Every time It's given a chance to do something interesting it just throws that away to reference revenge of the sith for the billionth time. Like yes we get it this takes place during revenge of the sith, you don't have to remind us every 5 minutes. It also ends leaving so many questions unanswered as if we're supposed to connect the dots ourselves. The last two episodes are decent and the last episode actually made me feel positive emotions so that's something at least. The conflict between ahsoka, rex and the clones was pretty hard to watch considering I've spent 13 years watching these characters fight alongside eachother.

Overall though I refuse to believe Dave Filoni had complete creative control over this, it just has Disney written all over it. If the rise of skywalker hadn't left me so empty then I think this would've broken my spirits. This was soulless and uninspired and I have never been so unimpressed. Star Wars the clone wars deserved a way more respectful ending than this.

StarWars,"Spoilers for Rebels. Like, major ones.

So at the time of Rebels airing season 1, everyone just *knew* that Kanan was going to die. He had to. Otherwise there would still be a Jedi left at the time of the OT films 

The way that they did it though? I cry every time. I was in absolute tears watching it just now. The lack of speech and very emotional score, mixed with a elegant and sleek environment (is this becoming a trend or something) just pulls at the heartstrings. 

In stopping the explosion he uses all of his might to save his friends still. Then of course to make you try again, they restore his sight for just a second, and in that one second he sees the love of his life- he just sees for the last time. He sees hope still. They make the explosion colourful, like all of the Rebels' previous ones showing that they still have a chance after the great sacrifice. And to make it even worse, you remember that Zeb and Chopper and the rest of the crew never said goodbye. 

As for episode 11, we finally understand just how much Kanan meant to Ezra. He goes back to his old ways without him very quick (his method of choosing what way to go for example) and doesn't know where to go. Bringing Kanan back as a Loth Wolf further shows is that Ezra has a connection to Lothal. The whole planet is literally his family too, and Kanan is a part of that, he's never going to leave.

It's just so well done. I'm always crying at it. Filoni and Pablo Hidaglo truly are a masterpiece dream team.",I was rewatching Rebels and completely forgot about the artistry that is episode 10 and 11

StarWars,"Watching the finale of Clone Wars yesterday and was having fun trying to place the epilogue scene with Darth Vader in terms of the chronology of the series. The quick cut to this scene makes it feel like there hasn't been much of a time jump, but all of the tech and armor (Lambda shuttle, Stormtroopers, etc.) seems to point to this taking place several years later or more. My personal head cannon (until Filoni confirms otherwise) is that this may be taking place during Vader's search for clues about Ahsoka in the months prior to their confrontation in Twilight of the Apprentice. Curious what everyone else thinks!",When does the Clone Wars epilogue take place?

StarWars,"1: We obviously saw Savage Oppress kill Adi Gallia. We saw Grievous capture her the previous season, so if we had him kill her then instead it could have made him look better. Still cool to see Savage prove himself a formidable opponent though.

2: Eeth Koth wasn't in RotS and was captured by Grievous in season 2. Again, could have had Grievous kill him then

3: When Ima-Gun Di had his final stand in season 3, he was obviously gunned down by droids. What we could have seen was Di and Captain Keeli defeat the droids, then Grievous comes and kills them both.

4: If you've read Dark Disciple you know what happens to Ventress after TCW. But what they could have done was when Grievous invades Dathomir, have him succeed in killing Ventress.

5: In ARC troopers, Grievous fights Obi-Wan on Kamino while Anakin fights Ventress and Shaak Ti does nothing. What they could have done was have some other Jedi knight or master there instead of Obi-Wan and have Grievous kill that Jedi. Because really, there was no tension in that fight since we knew they'd both survive. Maybe that could have been where Grievous killed Koth or Gallia.",Five ways they could have made Grievous a more formidable opponent in TCW
StarWars,"Hey guys I just watched Rise of the Skywalker as it just came out on Disney + (late to the party I know), and thankfully it hadn't been spoiled for me all this time.

At the end of the movie, &gt;!she adopts the name Skywalker. !&lt; I understand this is a contentious point for some in the fanbase.

I just wanted to make the point that hasn't it heavily been theorised that Palpatine created Anakin in Shimi's womb using his sith manipulation of life. If a star wars expert has confirmation on this lemme know. Anyhow this Palpatine connection accounts for the Skywalker lines affinity for the force. 

Therefore Palpatine is Anakin's father through the force as he created Anakin in Shimis womb. In essence the skywalker line is a derivation of Palpatine line. This would make Anakin and Rey's father ""half-brothers"" through the force, Rey's father being the biological offspring of Palpatine and Anakin being Palpatine's offspring through sith manipulation of midi-chlorians. This would make Palpatine Ben's Great-Grandfather via the force. Rey's father would be Ben's Granduncle via the force and finally, Rey would be Ben's first cousin once removed.

 Palpatine being the origin of Rey and Bens force powers through their respective lineages. Maybe this is why they are Dyads?

StarWars,"in tcw, rush clovis is a supporting character thats there to make anakin jealous and demonstrate some of his darkside tendencies. this isnt achieved as well as it could be (looking specifically at his plotline in s6), because:

 i) clovis behaves underhandedly, justifying anakin's suspicion. 

ii) clovis makes a couple of passes at padme, and anakin lashes out at him over catching clovis trying to kiss her. anakins assumption that something is happening between them is perfectly understandable here, so the whole ""youve gotta trust your wife"" thing doesnt land.

iii)  the only mitigating factor that's meant to make his actions unjustified is that padme isnt into clovis. this element works but its hammered in so much in the story that clovis is framed as a dick that cant take a hint and the audience doesnt get to view the perspective that matters (anakins).

if clovis didnt collaborate with dooku, didnt overtly come onto padme, and padme wasnt shown to be totally disinterested, then the story would work a lot better to highlight how controllingly jealous anakin is.",rush clovis fails as a supporting character
StarWars,"For me, it’s the scene at the Sarlacc pit in Return of the Jedi. It just has everything in a Star Wars scene that you can expect, action, drama, a bit of comedy. Most major characters from the original trilogy, not just one but TWO huge alien type creatures, a plan that has some hiccups but eventually works out, and of course you can’t forget the cheesy effects of the sail barge exploding and them flying away.

What scene in the movies, TV shows or any other media do you feel just fully embodies Star Wars?",What do you think is the most Star Wars scene in Star Wars?
StarWars,"By connecting Luke and Vader as first son and man who killed his father, and then as son and father, it upped the stakes dramatically and *immediately*. It informed all of Luke's (and Vader's) actions for the entire trilogy.

Rey and Kylo being strangers made a great deal of Rey's behavior seem forced (why is she so preoccupied with turning Kylo in TLJ, a man she only met days earlier and hates?). The fact that they were strangers hampered the development they wanted to happen in the film. Having no time-jump between VII and VIII also hampered that development. 

They followed the blueprint of the Luke/Vader interactions and eventual culmination without establishing the foundation for those interactions and culmination. 

It's somewhat reminiscent of Star Trek into Darkness, where they recreated a death scene that originally occurred between two people who were friends for decades, but this time around they had it happen between two people who were just getting to know eachother.","The decision by TLJ to force the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship into the Luke/Vader pattern (""Join me""; ""I can turn him"") was probably the biggest mistake of the sequel trilogy."
StarWars,"I would love to hear everyone's theories on this.

With the exception of Rey and Kylo in ep 9, Starkiller in TFU, and maybe a few other times, Jedi use so much restraint when it comes to the force. They will stand and watch the enemy get away, or fly away into space, they rarely use items in their surroundings to attack enemies.

Is this kinda reatraint taught to the Jedi as they grow up and are trained, or is it a choice to maybe fight fairly?? Or maybe doubt of their abilities??

Why let the enemy get away on foot, force trip them and catch them

Why let the enemy get on a ship and fly away, force grab the ship and pull it back.

Why not use movement as a distraction, force push or pull objects at your enemy.

Every sith in the movies has used the force to throw objects in battle, but Vader stands idly by as Leia's ship gets away in Rogue One.

Is using the force in this manner considered cheating or not fighting fairly to the Jedi?
Is it considered using the dark side?

Yoda says ""size matters not"" so according to him, everyone who can use the force should be able to move ANYTHING with their mind.

Could it be that alot of jedi doubt their own abilities and don't even try it???","Is ""use of the force restraint"" taught to jedi as they train, or is it a choice"
StarWars," Certain Youtube arguments about this topic and Ahsoka's all canon feats in general had me thinking...

While Anakin has always been regarded as the most talented Jedi, the literal Chosen One, going by everything seen in canon continuity, Ahsoka has never been far behind in terms of talent. Even as a young Padawan, she could at least put up a fight against the likes of Ventress and Grievous. These two are obviously inferior to Maul, but are both capable of challenging Jedi Masters (not just Knights, but Masters), so a regular Padawan should be nothing but fodder to them. Ahsoka was obviously at least at a solid Knight level herself at that time, official Padawan rank being there mostly due to her youth and lack of experience.

Ahsoka progressed so fast in terms of both power and skill during the war due to a combination of raw talent and constant combat experience, that she actually caught up with Maul by the very end of the conflict. The same Maul who's superior to an average Master. While the fight was quite close, her beating him places her nearly at Council level power. Of course, she couldn't officially progress past her Padawan rank, as she wasn't a part of the Order anymore. So yeah, while her progress seems more believable than Rey's (taught by Anakin himself, plus constant war experience), going from Padawan level to Council level in the span of a few years while having neither Skywalker nor Palpatine blood makes her quite a Mary Sue (not that it makes her a worse character in any way).

Later, in her novel, and in Rebels, she seems to have progressed even further. Inquisitors are basically no threat to her. Maul is her peer at most, more likely an inferior. Ahsoka actually put up a fight against roughly prime Vader. A Sith around Sidious's level, who makes Maul and Dooku (both being Jedi Master killers) look like amateurs. She had no hope of winning, but still, between her actually fighting Vader for a time, and standing up to Sidious's sorcery just a few minutes later, comfortably places her among the top Council level Jedi. Quite likely superior to any version of Obi Wan, for example, inferior only to Yoda, Mace and ROTS Anakin (maybe..).

Am I wrong in my assessment?","Is Ahsoka Really This Powerful, Or Am I Missing Something? (canon, possible CW spoilers)"
StarWars,"This is my first post so sorry if there is any mistakes, i just wanted to get this of my chest even if it is to random strangers over the internet.

I can't rember a time where my parents weren't divorced and my dad really struggled, he was depressed and he really struggled to take care of me, my twin brother and my older sitser but that's when my dad introduced me and my brother to star wars and I instantly loved the franchise

. One day we were surfing channels when we came across star wars the clone wars so we watched it the next time it was on (it was on at about 7 pm I think) me and my twin brother loved it and so did my dad so we started to watch it a lot and it was great. It was great, my dad seemed to be as exited for it just as much as we were. I don't have a perfext relationship with my Dad but I love to look back at these times when watching the clone wars and to see how it help us through tough times.

StarWars,"The series finale of the clone wars really brought tho ya into perspective for me. I was never sure how I felt about order 66 being mandated by a chip opposed to the clones just following orders, it made sense for the clone wars show but that’s about as far as I took it. With these last two episodes we really see the emotion side of things. 

First with Rex right after order 66 is given. He’s shaking with tears in his eyes as he’s about to execute the girl he has know for years. We see it again with Jesse. He almost doubts the order at the request of Rex in the hanger bay before gathering his resolve again. 

The whole point of the clone wars show was to display who the clones were. Not as a group. Identical meat bags but each individuals with personality. They have potential beyond their station as soldiers, heck we even see one with a family in Deserter. Even in Cat and Mouse we see a clone made a personal decision to betray the Republic. The clones are their own person, they make decisions and they control who they are. 

But not when order 66 came. It destroyed who they were as persons. No longer did they have choice. They only had their orders. Ahsoka realizes this, she tells Rex it’s not his fault, it’s the chip. She insists to not kill any of the troops, even if they are willing to die, she will not be the one to kill them. When she and Rex escaped she set out to bury each of the fallen Clones despite that they had tried to kill her. She did not blame a single one because they were as much a victim as the Jedi were. Their choice, their freedom, their person gone with a single order. 

Ahsoka new they were good soldiers even after all that. She buried them as good soldiers, giving them honor even after betrayal. Ahsoka showed wisdom greater than many other Jedi by understanding that they were good soldiers corrupted by an order. They were good soldiers. 

And good soldiers follow orders.

StarWars,"I’m beginning to slowly get tired of Star Wars for the first time ever (28M). The fanbase has become so toxic. Personally, I love ALL of the movies and TV shows. Sequels, prequels, original trilogy, Mandalorian, Clone Wars, I love it all! I’ve got posters, t-shirts, and have a shoebox filled with my old toys. But I don’t even want to share my opinion or talk about the franchise anymore to basically anyone. If I dare express my opinion on which movies I enjoy more than others (yes I love them all, but of course I’ve got my own ranking of most to least favorite), a full forced attack comes out from a bajillion people. If I say the opposite (just to see what happens), the exact same thing will occur. It seems that almost all SW fans feel that they personally own it and if it doesn’t meet their EXACT standards, the movie/show is shit. And all I’m left here thinking is, “I hope they realize that these movies are pretend and their target audience is children.” It sucks. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and shouldn’t be chastised for it. Civil discussion and respect for different opinions is key in any debate. Want to know what I did to celebrate yesterday?

So that is a very good thing Disney actually did. Rebels, Fallen order and the inquisitors fit so much better in Star Wars 

2. Ahsoka’s character is so well written, and so massively loved, the only death her character can have now, that is acceptable for her character, is natural causes/old age like Yoda.

I loved all of them, and things like “poor” animation or “boring” stories that the show “suffered” from early on never bothered me. Even watching Season 6 and now Season 7, I still get that magical sense I got watching the movie and first few episodes.

StarWars,"After the disappointment of the sequels, if it could be redone what would your story be instead?

My story (thought up just now so bear with) 

Episode 7 - The Empire was defeated, what was left of the empire split into minor factions, a ""New Republic"" has been established. Leia is in a prominent position. The inquisitors are your antagonists with a fleet of star destroyers, they act like pirates/vikings making raids on new republic worlds. (Also searching for Sith artifacts during raids) 
Luke has set up his own academy determined not to repeat the mistakes of the jedi. Instead of jedi they are called ""Skywalkers"" and they are neither light side nor dark side, but a perfect balance of the force. It's a place where anyone can learn the force if it calls to them. Leia is also trained as a skywalker and her son Ben Solo is trained too. However he begins to show more curiosity in the Dark side of the force. 
The new Republic decides to send some men to deal with the inquisitors and stop an impending raid. Ben Solo elects himself to go and prove himself as his uncle once did. Whilst there he has a confrontation with the inquisitors and the their storm troopers. (Epic lightsaber battle ensues) but when he finds out they are searching for sith artifacts, and their history (trained by darth vader) he decides to join them and learn about the dark side. 
When Luke finds out what has happened he assumes he has been kidnapped. Both Luke and Leia and other members of the skywalker academy (a young girl called Rey among them who was padawan to Ben Solo) , along with a small swat battalion of new Republic soldiers (Finn being one of them) to chase down the inquisitors and ""rescue"" Ben, to do this they need Han as he knows that area of space better than anybody. 
Han and Leia split some years after return of the jedi and he's basically James Kirk of the star wars universe now using his space hero status to bang aliens left right and centre. However he has his own troubles, he is currently being hunted by bounty hunters (he doesn't know why as its not money related) thinks it might be to do with death of Jabba?? Turns out it is Boba Fett who wants him dead. 
Anyway basically abit awkward for both Leia and Han but it unites all the main characters from the originals together including Chewie for a rescue mission. 
They ward off the bounty hunters chasing Han, confront the inquisitors where they are startled to learn Ben Solo has joined them. Luke Skywalker is badly injured, they all escape but are left stranded in space as their engines were damaged. Sitting ducks for Boba Fett and his bounty hunters to capture them...end of episode 7
Or something like that! 
Episode 8 they are made to participate in Boba Fetts deadly games. They sent a distress signal and are rescued by Lando, Ben Solo bids to reunite the old empire factions but has to defeat the leader of the knights of Ren, convince generals to join him, episode 8 is about him doing different tasks and battling to unite them all. Eventually raising to the top, being leader of the inquisitors, the Knights of Ren, and all the remaining storm troopers. 
Leia trains at the skywalker academy, Rey believes she can reach Ben, (maybe?), Rey is sent on a mission to receive a powerful force object and is tested in her own way. Luke is in a ""one with the force"" coma recovering, seeing visions, speaking with force ghosts and the like. 
Peace talks are held between the new Republic and Ben Solos army, with both sides preparing for a trap.
Reys journey leads her to Ashoka??

Episode 9, I dunno... big space battle between the two sides, luke returns from his coma more powerful than ever, Kylo Ren and his inquisitors/pirates/knights of Ren attack the capital hold them hostage, Ashoka, Rey, army of skywalker jedi attack, loads going off, Luke returns and kicks ass, I don't know I'm making all this up as I go along 😂",Rewrite the sequel trilogy - what's your story?
StarWars,"I got into Star Wars pretty late, around 2011 when I was 20 years old. When I watched The Phantom Menace for the first time, I knew from Queen Amidala’s first scene that she was played by Natalie Portman, because she’s famous and she’d just won an Oscar for Black Swan. For the same reason, I also realised that whenever Keira Knightly was playing Amidala, it wasn’t the same person, and I assumed it was either a really bad stunt double or it was meant to be a decoy in the story. Once Padme appeared for the first time, also played by Natalie Portman, I worked the whole thing out and saw straight through the decoy, so the big reveal toward the end was meaningless to me because I’d already guessed it.

But, it’s clear that I wasn’t meant to guess it. Lucas seems to have gone to an effort to disguise the decoy thing, putting Amidala in a lot of makeup and switching Padme and Sabe pretty much every other scene. The whole reveal is clearly meant to be a dramatic twist, with the added humor that Qui-Gon saw through it the whole time. Plus Natalie Portman wasn’t that well-known in 1999, her biggest role up to that point was in Leon: The Professional, and she was just a kid in that. 

So my question is, for those who saw this movie in 1999, was the decoy thing actually a twist? Or did you guess it earlier in the movie?",Question about the whole Padme decoy thing
StarWars,"I feel like this is never really mentioned when people are commending *or* criticising the sequels, Idk maybe people don't pay as much attention to the duels as I do. 

Each trilogy had its own style. The OT duels were slow, careful, paced, and elegant, except for a few exceptions (like Luke's burst of anger after Vader taunts him about Leia in ROTJ). Then you have the prequels, which are flashy, acrobatic, and almost like some superhero fight. They go beyond anything you could recreate IRL, and give it all an air of fantasy and glamour. 

But the sequels also have their own distinct styles. Contrary to the OT, they're much more sudden and erratic. The strikes of each lightsaber are forceful and passionate. But they're also a lot slower than the prequels, but in return, the lightsabers feel so much heavier. Each strike has so much weight and strength in it, unlike the prequels where you'd be convinced the lightsabers all weighed about a gram and get flung around like a roll of paper.

The duel between Rey and Kylo in Rise of Skywalker is I think the pinnacle of this, and one of the most underrated duels in the franchise. It's passionate, weighty, violent, and just feels so on-edge, as though every hit could be the one that kills someone. Personally, I absolutely loved it, and the rest of the duels in the sequels, and I wish they all got a bit more love.",I feel that there isn't nearly enough love for the lightsaber combat in the sequels
StarWars,"This is not going to be a popular post. I know many of you enjoy the clone wars, and I do from time time aswell, but i'd really like it to be removed from canon and just seen as a side piece to the main plot &amp; canon lore. The Clones personality in this show defies the whole expendable clone army point made in attack of the clones, and if they weren't ment to be expendable, why not just use humans? It would be the same as now, only not everyone has Jangos face, they could still be cybernetically alterted to create things like the bad batch, it's a sci fi after all. I don't like the whole thing about the inhibitor chip, as the whole point is that the army bred for the republic recieves an order from the head of the republic, an order even most Human military men would follow. There would be few defections, and I mean FEW, like maybe 1 or 2, who would either be killed or hunted. When in war, and the highest in command gives and order you follow them, without question. That is what it is like to be in the military, so why would clones, specifically bred to serve as the army of the Republic need chips, when most humans wouldn't? The order is code-numbered 66 &amp; all the clones know what this order is, it is probably set there as an ""safety issue"" for the republic, and kept hidden from the jedi, as, ofc, they would most likely have something to say about it. Clever. The Jedi couldn't even sense the sith sitting right infront of them, so ofc, they didn't know about the order either. Order 66 - Terminate the jedi. Military units, clones or otherwise, would execute.

StarWars,"From the very first scene to the 2nd to last scene, the entire clone wars series has taken place, well, in the clone wars.

I would love to see if they took the series tittle literally, and then release a new series that takes place during the empire.

Now I know Rebels exists, but its different. Between the animation and story telling, its different. unlike Rebels, I would be SO cool to have a ""clone wars"" style show that follows the stories of Luke, Leia (maybe as a Jedi?), Han solo, Yoda , Ahsoka etc. Not to mention the main antagonist, Lord Vader. Iconic character from live action films turned to top tier cinematic animation with countless new stories to tell, EXACTLY what the clone wars did. 

As far as what timeline it would be set in, honestly, I wouldn't care. It could follow Luke &amp; original character between episodes 4&amp;6, it could follow Ashoka &amp; Rex right where we last saw them, If I had to chose, Preferably between episodes 5&amp;6 (like how clone wars follows 2&amp;3).

We all saw that final scene, and just that one scene removes all doubts that Dave &amp; his team could do an amazing job.

Just imagine, ""Star Wars: Empire"".

StarWars,"For what J.J. Abrams worked with from episode 8, he created a GOOD movie, maybe not the best Star Wars movie of all time, but for what it's worth it certainly made lemonade out of lemons, coming from episode 8, Abrams did the best with what he had.

Everywhere from the scene with kylo changing to ben solo, from the uniting of Rey and Kylo to face Darth Sidious, and even all of the funny one liners from C-3PO. The movie had everything we could have asked for from the bad plot of Episode 8.

Now I know that some of the scenes especially the end ""Skywalker"" scene was cringe... But overall it was a great movie, and a great Star Wars movie at that. The music was blended perfectly for all of the scenes, the plot of good vs. evil, was great, and it showed that we all might not choose where we come from but we choose who we are!

StarWars,"I was rewatching TROS to celebrate May the 4th and was wondering if there was an in-canon explanation for the final Ben Solo and Rey scene. 

As far as my understanding, when a force-sensitive user (that has been “trained”) dies, their physical body disappears as they enter the cosmic force and become a force ghost (ie. Clone Wars Season 6). This has occurred several times already including Ben Solo, Luke, Leia, etc. 

However in the climax of TROS, Rey dies after defeating Palpatine and her body does not disappear. This was not initially surprising and after Ben Solo uses force healing to resurrect her - I was surprised his body disappeared (implying he will become a force ghost). 

Outside of being a Skywalker by blood, why would this occur without any formal training? It appears at Ben and Rey shared a lot of the same abilities as part of the force dyad so why would he have this ability while she does not? It seems like a convenient plot point to ensure that Rey would not be able to use force healing to resurrect him. What are your thoughts?",TROS Force Ghost Question

4. The protagonist flies away to the remaining friends. Makes a big ass speech about courage, valour and overcoming odds.

If they can do all of that then why not give the average joe the abilitt to use the force? And I'm that same note. 
Question#2. The ancient sith lord momon bound his soul to his helmet, so is it possible to fill an object with the force?

StarWars,"Mild spoilers for Siege of Mandalore.

Order 66 was meant to be an order from an authority Ranking higher than a (Jedi) General, to execute the Treasonous Jedi. It was meant to be for people like General Krell. Had the 501st contacted a higher ranking authority, they had the grounds to Execute Order 66 in the case. 

Now, the thing is, the only people we know to have higher authority than a Jedi General in the Clone Command Structure is the Chancellor Himself. 

Now, let's look at what happened with Siege of Mandalore. Unprompted, The Jedi authorised a Siege on a Neutral planet, with the best justification they have being capturing Maul. (A personal matter to the Jedi. Nothing of concern to the republic)

With that they broke multiple peace treaties, AND plunged the republic into another war. Yes, this was an action of just Kenobi and Skywalker, but the rest of the council didn't oppose or disagree with this action. 

That essentially IS an act of Treason, in and of itself.

On top of that, The Chancellor was not given an opportunity to give up his emergency powers. Ki Adi Mundi clearly raises a valid point in the council discussion ""IF the chancellor does not give up his emergency powers."" 

First thing after confirming the war was over, they didn't ask him to give up the emergency powers, but directly jump to arresting him. 

Dark Side users or not, fact remains, the Jedi committed Treason, and the Order was not something most of the senate would disagree with given these two incidents. Palpatine was well within the law doing what he did.",Order 66 Had In Universe Legal justification for being executed
StarWars,"The chosen one is supposed to be the one who restores balance to the force. Anakin restored balance/completed the prophesy when he killed the emperor but since it turns out he failed in killing him then doesn't that mean balance wasn't restored until Rey killed the emperor in the latest movie thus making her the chosen one and not Anakin?

Kind of annoying that her being the chosen one now makes the previous 6 movies redundant but oh well. This trilogy probably shouldn't even exist or be considered cannon anyway.",So is Rey technically the chosen one?
StarWars,"Since Star Wars content is slowing down until fall besides the behind the scenes Mandalorian series (as within the last 2 1/2 months I have started and finished watching all the movies, Clone Wars, Rebels, and seen most of the canon comics), I wanted to give the canon books a go. The only two i'm genuinely interested in are ""Ahsoka"" and ""Dooku: Jedi Lost"" (I'm planning on listening to the audiobooks as Ashley Eckstein reads the Ahsoka novel). Are these books really any good? I see that they have pretty good ratings and so do many of the Star Wars books which in turn had me questioning whether the quality of these books are actually what people say, or if its just the fanbase dismissing decent writing because it is Star Wars or has their favorite character. Now, i'm not expecting nor even looking to get anything near an award winner or modern classic; all I would like to know is if these books, mostly the two i'm interested in, can tell a compelling enough story to entertain this 17 year old. I just recently got into Star Wars and i'm eager to soak in more stories about Ahsoka and Count Dooku; however, PLEASE let me know if these books are childish or have any other major problems. And, if there is another book besides the two that I mentioned that REALLY stood out as a genuinely good read, let me know.",What's your HONEST opinion on Star Wars canon books?

And even in Rise of Skywalker he was somewhat training Ben. And this whole time Palpatine still considered himself a sith as if they never died. Because they didn't. So is Kylo Ren still not considered a sith or am I missing something?.",Is Kylo Ren still NOT a sith?
StarWars,"Sometimes I think they pretend to hate it so they can bandwagon with the ""free thinking"" critics who believe they're some kind of expert and sole decision making body of the fanbase.

They say it's garbage, not even Star Wars, not even part of the saga, that they'll skip it and never watch it, directly attacking those who like the movie. 

Since when did members of the Star Wars community blast so much negativity? It is not supposed to be like this. It's fair to dislike a film, but is it really productive and rewarding to spam entire discussions bringing up truly disgusting words against movies that the young kids of today have been watching growing up, as did today's adults with the PT?

StarWars,"Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . . 

There was a moment in the history of the galaxy that was unlike any other, unlike all the other events that took place. It was beautiful.

The Old Republic was the Republic of legend, greater than any other. No need to know where it was or from whence it came, only to know that . . . it was THE Republic.

Once, under the wise rule of the Senate and the protection of the Jedi Knights, the Republic thrived and grew. It was a haven for all its citizens. But as often happens when wealth and power pass beyond the admirable and attain the awesome, then appear those evil ones who have greed and power to match.

So it was with the Republic at its height. Like the grandest of trees, able to withstand any external attack, the Republic rotted from within though the danger was not visible from the outside. 

Over time, the greed- and control-minded rulers known as the Separatists emerged in the galaxy, and caused massive disturbance. Because of this, the Jedi, along with its Grand Army of clones, were tasked to stop the Separatists from destroying their Republic. 

Eventually, aided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected Chancellor of the Republic. He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic. 

Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor, shutting himself away from the population. Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot-lickers he appointed to high office, and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears. 

Soon after, he turned the Clone army against the Jedi Knights, exterminating them through treachery and deception. He remade the once grand Republic into the Galactic Empire. Having done so, the Imperial governors and bureaucrats prepared to institute a rain of terror among the disheartened worlds of the galaxy. Many used Imperial forces and the name of the increasingly isolated Emperor to further their own personal ambitions. 

However, a small number of systems rebelled at these new outrages. Declaring themselves opposed to the Empire, they vowed to restore the once great Republic.



Now, the Empire is dead, the Death Star destroyed, and C3PO is still seen as a god to Ewoks.

May the force be with you all.","As May the Fourth draws to a close, I would like to share with you a quick recap of the events of the prequel trilogy and beyond."
StarWars," 

Wouldn't it be cool if: (Though I don't think it's correct.)

The Venator that Ahsoka and Rex crashed is actually the SAME Venator found on Zeffo in Fallen Order. The evidence is as such:

1. Both Venators have a shrine to the Clone Troopers that died there. The timeline would be that Ahsoka's shrine would have been messed up by the years of neglect, but the locals would have repaired it because they believed it to be a holy site. Evidenced by the next point.
2. Cal Kestis has a force echo that reads, ""The Villagers built this memorial to the clones on the Venator. If only they knew the truth.""
3. Both planets have snow.
4. Cal has a force echo that says, ""The ship crashed long ago, but there was a survivor, someone who understood the force. Most likely a padawan. He was injured."" This quote is evidence that he is not always sure who the people were in his echos. Therefore, the ""he"" could have been Ahsoka.
5. One of Cal's visions on the Venator is him hearing the Clone's receive order 66. He hears a clone saying, ""Oh, it's a transmission from the chancellor."" This could have been a vision of the exact moment the clones turned on Ahsoka.

Even though the evidence is weak AND there is evidence that they are two separate wrecks, it is awesome to see such a similar story in two different aspects of the Star Wars universe.",[SPOILERS] Clone Wars - Fallen Order connection theory
StarWars,"As much as I love watching the original trilogy, I have to admit that the visuals are dated. This might make it hard for some people the original trilogy. However, I don't want the original trilogy be full on replaced with a new live-action. I think it would be a fun experiment to see the original trilogy done in the Clone Wars (2008 to 2020) animation so we have a fresh spin on the original trilogy with the same character appearance. It would also help keep the original trilogy timeless.

I am interested to read the responses.",Should the original trilogy be remade with the Clone Wars animation?
StarWars,I know the clones had accelerated growth and would die in a relatively short period compared to regular non clones. But why not just keep making he Kaminoians keep producing clones? Wouldn’t that be easier than recruiting regular citizens of the galaxy to be in the Empire? I thought I remember reading somewhere that Jango Fetts DNA strand was being worn out and that’s why they stopped but they could’ve just got someone else to be the host. Is there a canon explanation for why clones were not used anymore?,Why didn’t Palpatine keep using clones?
StarWars,"I’d like to start out by saying that there’s never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan. I don’t care if you love or hate a certain trilogy, anthology, game, book, comic, or merchandise decision. We’ve gotten more content in the past 5 years than ever before, and I’m happy I get to be apart of it. Anyways, onto my thoughts. I’m sure this is a sentiment that’ll be echoed for years to come, but… I’ve been thinking a lot about the sequels, and my indifference for them is kinda subsided. I think that, objectively, they are all good popcorn films. You can sit down, turn off your brain, and enjoy them. They’re not great as a trilogy, but I can still watch them and get that rush of nostalgia for Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, and Lando whenever they pop in. I wish Rey, Kylo, Finn, and Poe had gotten some better development over the trilogy, and I wish that the story wasn’t so disjointed at times. But no one is forcing me, you, or anyone to watch it if they don’t want to. 

I do think that the directors could make some great Star Wars films if the tones and themes they introduced were part of anthology movies. I think that Rian Johnson, love or hate TLJ, could probably make a really competent Star Wars one-shot like Rogue One or Solo. (Give him a shot and watch Knives Out) 

And then we have the Clone Wars, The Mandalorian, Rebels, and all the upcoming shows. I really think this is where the future of SW belongs. Live action or animation, I don’t care, I just want weekly installments of a badass story that makes me feel like a kid again. 

TLDR: Ultimately, I’ll always prefer the OT as a fan, but the prequel era is what I grew up on. The sequel trilogy, to me, is like the server asking if I have room for dessert. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t. No matter if I do or don’t, I can sit and enjoy something that’s a little shorter and just as filling week after week.

I thought I'd choose one from each trilogy:

Prequels: I liked the banter between Obi Wan and Anakin during the opening of III. Having seen clone wars now, it brings kind of a new light or I guess depth to their relationship since they don't really work together much in the movies. 

Originals: I feel like its hard to pick a moment that is lowkey from the OT since its all been talked about already but I guess I'd go with seeing that shot of Luke's face after seeing his parents killed. That small head turn he does to look away but then looking back at his home right after was something I didn't really appreciate as much until recent. The whole moment felt just felt really well put together by everyone.

Sequels: In TFA, that sequence of a resistance ship mowing down the first order only to find out it was Poe who turns out survived is something I never get tired of watching.

StarWars,"I believe star wars is better now that it’s ever been. The things they are making are really quality entertainment. They dropped the finale for clone wars and it was fucking insane; the mandalorian was an amazing exploration of the galaxy, with a completely expressionless and nearly mute character as the protagonist which somehow manages to show more nuance and emotion through his acting than some of the characters in the sequel trilogy, and IMO rogue one was one of the best SW movies in recent years. So why is it that SW can’t manage to maintain the same level of quality for their main trilogy (which is what everyone sees even the people who aren’t that into star wars) as they have for their shows and spinoffs? I don’t understand it… you’d think they would want to make their MAIN PRODUCT BETTER than the stuff they have on Disney+ and their spinoff movies, since you know… it’s their main product. Does anyone know what caused this? Why their other stuff is so great while their main movies are just meh? I’m not saying I HATE the sequels, I really don’t, at least not as much as some ppl on the internet, but you are objectively wrong if you think they are better than Clone Wars, The Mandalorian or Rogue One, they’re just not. But they should be, they’re the face of Star Wars in the mainstream, so why aren’t they the focus of the studio? What went wrong?

I feel entirely different emotions than I did during Endgame, and that's exactly how it needed to be. The connection to Ahsoka and Vader in their final scenes was incredible.

These details don't matter.

When it comes to Rex being on Endor, I am genuinely surprised whenever I see people who feel the need to argue that the old man in Han's strike team in Return of the Jedi hasn't been retconned to be Rex.  Because that is clearly the intent.

Nik Sant is a fucking background character who was jokingly named after Santa Claus.  Why are people so slavish to details and so reticent for retcons for things that don't matter?  When the first images of Rex in that outfit were released, people were so excited.  Filoni's intent was clearly to have him on Endor, and even had a line mentioning it in the finale.

StarWars,"Ofcourse the title ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is meant as a little plot twist, as it made the audience (or atleast me and my friends) assume the movie would be more heavily surrounding Kylo Ren rather than Rey. As you already know the point was Rey takes the name Skywalker in the name of Leia. On a Side note, In my opinion this ruins Reys Character Arc because what is led to believe is that Reys adventure through the movies is to find out who she truly is, much like Luke, but rather than Excepting she is the relative of a mass murderer and one of the most evil forces in the galaxy, she disregards it which misses her whole objective. But I digress, As we know Anakin was a child of the force and the chosen one. The one meant to bring balance to the force. The Jedi believed this to be by getting rid of the sith, but as we saw it was the opposite and rather inadvertently getting rid of the Jedi to balance the Jedi to Sith ratio therefore balancing the force by leaving only 2 Jedi (Obi Wan and Yoda) and two sith (Him and Palpatine) but we quickly realize he made a new Jedi being Luke which left the force unbalanced once again. Then Darth Vader dies trying to kill Palpatine, but now we know it didn't work so he left 1 Jedi and 1 Sith once again balancing the force but we learn in the Force Awakens that there are more Jedi that Luke then goes on to train and once again inadvertently making another sith making the force unbalance. Rey then becomes all the Jedi as Luke states and then by killing Palpatine she becomes all the Sith. Youd think this would bring balance back to the force but yet she chooses a yellow lightsaber, being the color of the Jedi guard, yet again leaving everything messed up. If instead they had Kylo, or made Rey a real Skywalker, be the one left and had gone through with Kylos plan to get rid of good and evil and just be the force, it would have fulfilled Anakins prophecy by balancing the force through his decadents which I think would have been purely poetic.",The End of the Rise of Skywalker wasn't as powerful as it could have been
StarWars,"Just finished the OG trilogy. Trying wrap my head around what Lukes plan was in Return of the Jedi.

Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewbacca, and R2 all sitting around the digital chess board on the Falcon.

Luke: Ok first, Lando is going to go undercover for reconnaissance. Just blend in and whatever you do, don’t give me any information on any traps that you might encounter. 

Lando: Ummm, alright Luke are you sure? 

Luke: Yeah, I’m a Jedi Master now. I’m literally strong enough to pull the ears of gundark with my bare hands at this point. Trust me this is going to work.

Lando: Well, what if there’s like a huge pit with like a 75 foot dinosaur creature? 

Luke: Imma fight it with bones and rocks. Shits gonna be Lit Fam. Trust me, this is going to work! 

Lando: Ok, Bet. So, just blend in and don’t do anything. 

Luke: Precisely, you’ll know when to awaken from your sleeper cell when I give you a head nod. Leia, I’m going to need you to start learning Ubese. At least enough that you can haggle. 

Leia: Wait, what for?

Luke: Were going to sell Chewbacca to Jabba. 

Chewbacca: RAWRGWAWGGR!!!

Luke: Dude, calm down. It’s literally the same play we ran on the Death Star a few years ago except we getting paid.

Chewbacca: (Wimpers) rwarggr

Leia: So, Jabba speaks Ubese? 

Luke: No, he doesn’t. That’s why I’m sending R2 and 3PO in first to get captured so he can translate for you. You gotta sell it though. These mob boss types don’t respect common traders so you’re going to have to threaten him. 

Leia: So, point a gun at him is what your saying.

Luke: Nah, they’d gun you down faster than the Falcon does the Kessel run. Pull out a grenade and right before it blows up he should cave.

Leia: What if he doesn’t cave? 

Luke: Trust me, he will. Next, wait for everyone to fall asleep. Once everyone’s asleep you’re going to defrost our carbonite popsicSolo. 

Leia: Won’t that trigger an alarm? 

Luke: Probably, either way Han isn’t gonna be in any shape to escape since he won’t be able to see or walk. This is the part where you get captured and become one of his slave strippers.

Leia: WHAT?!!!

Luke: Trust me, this is going to work. Also, you’re going to need to start bumping up your cardio and cutting out all carbs, Jabba don’t mess with fatties.

Lando: So, Chewy and Han are going to be in jail and probably be sentenced to death for ruining Jabbas favorite piece of art and the droids and Leia are going to be turned into slaves. All the while Im acting as a double agent who does nothing until you give me a head nod. 

Luke: Yup

Lando: So, Hans thawed out, everyone’s captured but me, and needs rescued. When do you come in?

Luke: After everyone is captured I come in through the front door incognito style and use the force to choke out anyone who gets in my way. Then I’ll use my Jedi Mind trick to have Jabbas main servant bring me to Him. 

Lando: And then you’ll cut the giant slimy worm in half with your lightsaber? 

Luke: Lol no, R2 is going to have my lightsaber. 

R2: (excited) Beep do do weep beep do.

Luke: Thanks R2, make sure you spring load it and work on your parabola equations like we practiced. Also you can’t tell 3PO any of this plan because we all know he’ll snitch the first chance he gets. 

R2: (Beeps in agreement)

Leia: So, how are you going to kill Jabba and a hundred heavily armed Mercs without your light saber. 

Luke: I’m not going to kill him. This is the part where I get captured. 

Lando: WHAT?!!

Leia: WHAT?!!

Chewbacca: RAWGRWGW!!!!

Luke: Trust me guys this is going to work. Hope you guys like Sand Yachts. We’re going on a desert cruise!",What the hell was Lukes plan to rescue Han?
StarWars,"Ofcourse the title ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is meant as a little plot twist, as it made the audience (or atleast me and my friends) assume the movie would be more heavily surrounding Kylo Ren rather than Rey. As you already know the point was Rey takes the name Skywalker in the name of Leia.
On a Side note, In my opinion this ruins Reys Character Arc because what is led to believe is that Reys adventure through the movies is to find out who she truly is, much like Luke, but rather than Excepting she is the relative of a mass murderer and one of the most evil forces in the galaxy, she disregards it which misses her whole objective. But I digress, 
As we know Anakin was a child of the force and the chosen one. The one meant to bring balance to the force. The Jedi believed this to be by getting rid of the sith, but as we saw it was the opposite and rather inadvertently getting rid of the Jedi to balance the Jedi to Sith ratio therefore balancing the force by leaving only 2 Jedi (Obi Wan and Yoda) and two sith (Him and Palpatine) but we quickly realize he made a new Jedi being Luke which left the force unbalanced once again. Then Darth Vader dies trying to kill Palpatine, but now we know it didn't work so he left 1 Jedi and 1 Sith once again balancing the force but we learn in the Force Awakens that there are more Jedi that Luke then goes on to train  and once again inadvertently making another sith making the force unbalance.  Rey then gets rid of the Sith and Jedi and only leaving herself with the force which is shown by her ""colorless"" lightsaber. If Rey was actually a Skywalker, or If Kylo was the one left alive and became just a force user like Rey did instead, this would have been way more powerful in my opinion.  This would have meant Anakin was the really the chosen one and truly balanced the force through his descendent, but they instead chose to have this pseudo-Skywalker do this which makes it feel less Genuine.",The end of the Rise of Skywalker was as powerful as it could have been.
StarWars,"I'm not saying it was perfect, but I loved The Last Jedi...

Specifically, I loved The Last Jedi for where I thought it was taking the franchise. Which is why I'm pissed all over again after rewatching TROS.

After TLJ, I thought the SW universe was evolving in a thoughtful, new direction that began to flesh out parts of The Force mysticism in ways that felt more nuanced and real (And less David Copperfield-ish, sorry prequel Anakin).

The allegory of individual spirituality versus organized religion and the struggles we have with trying to impose a binary dogma onto a natural world that is neither good nor evil was GREAT. The Tolkien-esque “even the smallest person…” sentiment made TLJ and Rogue One incredibly compelling and heartfelt. I freaking cried at both those movies. 

This new world that would be post-Jedi, post light vs dark was so interesting. (It's the Jedi Reformation, sorta!)  TLJ got me giddy for the future of SW....

And I just re-watched The Rise of Skywalker hoping my expectations had just been too high when I saw it in theaters. 

NOPE. What a bore compared to what it could have been. The ending would literally be the laziest old trope ever...if it didn't take such a massive effort of storytelling gymnastics to force-fit it in. FUCK. 

Artists, storytellers, creative people... Have a fucking point of view and follow through with it. Make art for yourself for fucks sake and not the committee of the internet. 

This has been my TEDtalk. The point was really the title. All the rest of this was just a frustrated rant, but thanks for listening!

(Side note, Adam Driver is a national treasure. That man could be reading the encyclopedia and it would be magical AF. )",Storytellers should stick to their guns and ignore the internet.
StarWars,"This will either just get lost on here or nobody will care because this has been talked about many times

I finally got to watch ROS. Unfortunately didn't get to see it in theaters due to schedule conflicts with my best friend(who i see all SW movies with). Decided just to wait until it came out on +. I'm 26 and a big fan of all Star Wars. I love the prequels, Clone Wars, and Rogue One especially. I was a kid during that era.

Overall I liked this movie more than TLJ and about same as TFA

# Things I liked about ROS:

\-I knew Palaptine came back and was interested to see how it was handled. I know it was pure fanservice but I think it was handled well.

\-Rose was much more tolerable in this movie

\-All the jedi speaking to Rey was really cool. Especially that they included Ahsoka and Kanan.

\-I think Kylo's torment and confusion was one of the constant good things in the movies and i think his final transition into joining Rey was done well. From Luke to Snoke to Palpatine people were always thinking for him and he gradually started thinking for himself

\-Lando and the fleet joining the fight was awesome. My thought was the galaxy wasn't about to have another Empire reign

\-More fan service, but I'm glad they showed Leia training with Luke

\-Maybe I'm an idiot but i legit thought Chewie was killed by Rey at first and I was like holy shit Disney let this through?

\-I think overall the acting in these movies was well done. Especially feel bad for Daisy getting so much hate from people who don't like Rey.

# Things I didn't like (just some big things, not gonna nitpick):

\-The kiss was so random. I always viewed Rey and Ben as more of a brother-sister relationship

\-Rey did have some over-powered force abilities, though I didn't think it was as bad or ""mary-sue"" like as many people made her out to be. I think the lightning was some cheesy foreshadowing though

\-I didn't like her calling herself a Skywalker at the end. I just think her remaining as only Rey would have been better, but I understand why they did it

\-Finn still too obsessed with Rey. I was in full support of the Poe-Finn movement but no way Disney letting that fly

\-Knights of Ren were pretty lame after finally getting to see them

\-Maybe I missed it, but where did all the personnel and soldiers in Palpatine's fleet come from? Old Empire people or what

Overall I enjoyed the movie. I know there's a lot of hate and disappointment, but we're stuck with it. I think the thing that hurt them the most was switching directors and JJ just kind of finished it off the best he could with that and the fact that i heard rumors of Disney stepping in and cutting things out of his script.

Hope the comments stay civil. It's just a movie",Finally watched Rise of Skywalker
StarWars,"Happy May the 4th everyone!

I figured since today is Star Wars Day, I'd make a post and say what I like about every Star Wars movie, since this franchise is easily one of my favorites.

1. The Phantom Menace: This movie, despite all the hate it gets, does have a few things going for it. Liam Neeson is always great to see in almost anything, and Star Wars is no different. Darth Maul's introduction here is also consistently fun to watch, and most importantly, John Williams absolutely outdid himself on this movie with Duel of the Fates. 10/10 piece of music.
2. Attack of the Clones: The highlight of this movie, in my opinion, is the arena scene. Other than that, I really like Obi Wan. But who doesn't?
3. Revenge of the Sith: This is my favorite Star Wars movie. Yes, the dialogue and CGI are both really cheesy, but I think the tragedy of this movie is really well done, especially when viewed with Clone Wars Season 7. This movie's instant quotability and meme potential absolutely stands out, and I'm a huge fan of Palpatine in this movie, even if a certain tragedy does tend to get overtold on the internet.  
4. Solo: Looking back on this movie, seeing the subtle tie-ins to Maul's behind-the-scenes work is a really nice touch, and I really liked Paul Bettany's performance in this as well. Other than that, I thought that the train heist was cool.
5. Rogue One: Another personal favorite of mine, going into Rogue One I absolutely expected it to be tragic, but I still was blown away by how well this movie was written. I loved nearly every character's writing in this movie, which really surprised me, and the behind-the-scenes story of this movie makes this movie even better, as do the connections to Rebels.
6. A New Hope: I grew up in the later prequel era, so this movie doesn't have the nostalgia factor that it does for a lot of Star Wars fans. That being said, this movie's plot, while formulaic, tells an incredibly compelling story that has to be appreciated. And even though I can't appreciate this movie from a nostalgic standpoint, I can appreciate the phenomenal world building ANH established.
7. The Empire Strikes Back: This movie is often considered to be the best movie in the franchise, and while it isn't my personal favorite, I still concede that this movie is probably the best. The dynamic of Luke, Leia, and Han being further explored combines the action-based plot with a more interpersonal subplot, making the characters relatable and even more appreciable. And the reveal in this movie also has to be appreciated from a writing standpoint. This movie's ending also adds a lot to the movie, showing the heroes lose, and effectively sets up the next.
8. The Force Awakens: This movie has been compared to A New Hope, often criticized for following ANH's formula, which it does, but in my opinion the formula works and the movie shines as a result of it. Adam Driver's performance in this movie shines, and the scenes between Kylo Ren and Han Solo made a compelling story. I also really appreciated Domhnall Gleeson's performance as Hux in this movie, with his speech before Starkiller Base is fired bringing chills almost every time I watch this movie.
9. The Last Jedi: I'm going to start on a controversial note, but I really liked Luke in this movie. Even though Rian's decisions with him get a lot of hate, I do think it works really well with Lucas's so-loved Hero's Journey formula. Other than that, Adam Driver again does a phenomenal job bringing Kylo Ren to life, and I really like his dynamic with Rey. I also think that the visual effects in this movie are the best of the entire franchise, from Snoke's lair to Crait to even Holdo's lightspeed ram thingy.
10. The Rise of Skywalker: Adam Driver is again the highlight of this movie, giving what is in my opinion his most compelling performance of the sequel trilogy. Even though Palpatine's return came out of nowhere, Ian McDiarmid's voice acting is always a delight, and that is no different in this movie.",What I like about every Star Wars movie!
StarWars,"From lines about sand to killing the women and the children, the movie is quotable for all the wrong reasons.

That said, we as an audience have to remember, Anakin is basically a kid. He’s supposed to be 19 years old and has been in training to be a wizard monk for a decade.

He’s also been trained to suppress how he feels and the only person he thinks he loves outside of his own mother he hasn’t seen in a decade.

Anakin isn’t having a mature relationship at this point. It’s puppy love like your average high schooler would live through. He flirts awkwardly, has uninformed opinions, he even play wrestled her. This could have been a 19 year old on Naboo or in Nebraska. He’s immature and the pure cringe from watching padawan learner dating is almost understandable. I somehow doubt there was a Jedi sex education class so we should be grateful we were spared Padme having to give Anakin “the talk.”

The movie is also necessary because we need to see Anakin:

1) Develop an unhealthy attachment after years of not having anything 

2) React when he loses his first and only other attachment i.e. his mother. His homicidal rage portends what happens when he loses something he loves. He acts irrationally with no regard for anyone else.

With her gone, all he has left is Padme. When he thinks she betrays him, we saw what happens. When he thinks he killed her...yikes!

Is it my favorite? No. 

But does it serve its specific narrative purpose? I think it does that very well.","Unpopular opinion: Although very cheesy at times, Attack of the Clones was a necessary film for exactly the reasons people hate it"
StarWars,"The two of them and their three daughters (aged 4, 6, and 7) had never seen any of the movies or shows. But they recently went to Disney World in early March and were intrigued thanks to the quality of the Galaxy’s Edge portion of the park. 

So, on April 7th, the embarked for a galaxy far, far away. After some initial discussion, and because of the age of the girls, they decided to start with Episode I since it’s a bit “lighter” to rest of the girls would like it and gauge their reactions to the intense scenes. THEY LOVED IT.  They followed with Episode II, Rogue One, and then straight through IV - VIII whenever they could find the time as a family to watch a movie together. 

The kids have been making homemade spaceships and lightsabers and can’t stop talking about ideas, playing out different scenes, and dreaming about their hopeful next visit to Disney. 

Well, how fitting... unknowingly they found time today to close out the series. They all watched Episode IX today - in Star Wars day! - and are fully in love with the whole series. 

It’s been so fun introducing a whole new crew to the the SW universe. The conversations have been great and they’re totaled hooked! Clone Wars and Mandalorian are next up...

The above are from Wookiepedia, but Vader heals himself in the novels of the OT.","For those that complain that ""Force Healing"" was not a thing..."
StarWars,"Not really spoiling anything here but we're talking S7 so spoiler tag.

So, I've seen people throw around the fact that budget made a difference. Whether or not the budget was actually higher, I have no idea. I'm wondering if anyone can do a breakdown, not only of budget, but of animation technology in general that made season 7 look so much better?

I noticed depth of field looked a lot better. I don't know if it's that they had time to do a better DOF pass, or maybe didn't have the tech before. Also, something in the way light is rendered, especially the highlights?

And of course, there's the mocap that made the movement during specific scenes look waaay better. But the animation, in general, did seem more refined. Anakin's hair, for example, had a movement to it that looked better than usual. 

Anything else people know of? I'm so curious because the art style was something I always actively disliked. I mean, no matter how good the story got, I couldn't stop thinking ""if only this was 2D or live action"". I didn't enjoy visuals of lightsaber fights or any of the character expressions because they felt so stiff and lifeless. It did get better in later seasons, but it's like a threshold was crossed for season 7 that took it from barely passable to *great.* And I'm dying to know how that threshold was passed!","At a technical level, what made TCW Season 7 look so much better?"
StarWars,"Look at Maul in the last episode. Even though he is famous for his double-lightsaber, I think it was really ballsy for them to make Mauls final scene in the Clone Wars be an example of how powerful he is WITHOUT his lightsaber. I mean, look at what he was able to do - he could rip off the walls and use them as shields, and then use those same pieces to cut Clone Troopers in half, use their own blasters against themselves, and PULL APART A FREAKING HYPERSPACE DRIVE TO PULL A SHIP OUT OF HYPERSPACE. That was a great way to show how powerful Maul truly has become - he doesn't even need his lightsaber anymore to kick ass.   

And to be honest, I don't think Yoda and Palpatine, at their current levels of power, really need lightsabers. I think they are strong enough that they could be perfectly fine without their lightsabers - I mean, we kinda saw that in the final battle between Yoda and Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith, as well as in Return of the Jedi.","Even though we all love lightsaber fights, I think Jedi or Sith without lightsabers who only rely on the force to fight have more room for creativity, and for some, might even be stronger without a lightsaber."
StarWars,"I think, or am choosing to think, that the final scene takes place after their fight in Rebels. Vader igniting the lightsaber to me is a sign of recognition. We almost never see Vader even acknowledge that he used to be Anakin, but at this moment he does that and shows he remembers Ahsoka. I hope this scene is after their fight and he has come to this place almost as an admission of guilt. When he ignites the lightsaber I think that it is the first step into redemption. I like to think that Ahsoka's presence started to soften up Vader, and Luke appearing so soon after this finalized the return of Anakin.",Final Scene Thought

StarWars,"This has bothered me for years, and today, being the Fourth of May, I thought I'd clear something up.

In the presence of a large gravitational object, like a black hole, the closer you are to the body, the shorter the trajectory of your orbit, but the faster you have to go to maintain that short trajectory. This means that your ability to take a shorter path is because you were able to go faster.

You see this every day.

Satellites in low Earth orbit (400ish km) can complete their orbits in ~90 minutes. At ~35,786km  above the planet, a satellite orbits at almost exactly the same speed the Earth rotatees and stays directly above one spot (remaining 'geostationary'), and takes the same time; 24 hours. The Moon orbits once every 28ish days... at 300,000km distance.

Those low altitude satellites, taking the substantially shorter path than the moon, move in excess of 7.8km/s, while the Moon orbits at a leisurely 1km/s.

In the presence of intense gravity, speed and distance become synonymous.

Enter the Kessel run.

The Kessel spice run was originally described as a spice run through ""the Maw"" a super large collection of black holes all orbiting relatively near each other. When you made the run, you could go the long way, taking large radius orbits and paths around those immense gravitational objects, and add a ridiculous amount of distance to cover, forced to take this slow, painfully long route, taking substantially more time, because your POS star-ship was a slow moving garbage scow.

Or, if you were lucky, you could take the shortest trip possible, passing supper close to those black holes, without fear of falling into them, the total length of your path now less than 12 parsecs, all because you were the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy, your speed keeping you from dying.

Making the Kessel run in 12 parsecs was bragging about being amazingly, incredibly fast, but in the technical parlance of a guy who knew what he was talking about to other space ship captains and pilots who also knew what he meant.

That's why Obi-Wan looks impressed (a former star-fighter pilot) when Han makes that claim, but Luke, who'd only ever flown speeders, doesn't.",12 Parsecs; a rant.
StarWars,"So I'm watching all the star wars movies in order, may the 4th be with you, and I'm watching mace windu duel with Palpatine. Mace Windu  brings with him 3 other Jedi. I've invisioned the narrative he has with the jedi he takes with him.

StarWars,"I know the actual Order is specific to Jedi and that they have turned on the Republic and tried to take over themselves but what happens on planets that don’t have Jedi? I know that’s probably unlikely as they were generals and commanded the clone army but like with Mandalore in Clone Wars what did the contingent of clones do there? Did they attack Mandalore because they were allied with a Jedi or did they attack because they weren’t allies with the Republic or did they not attack? I feel like they did attack but I’m wondering what the reason would be specifically. And of course Mandalore did end up under imperial control after they sieged the planet but was that the same battle as this one or a later battle where it would have been with more troops against the mandalorians? It didn’t look like there was a huge number of clones in the episode but there also weren’t many mandalorians either. 

Also in Revenge we see the clones attacked the Wookies but why? Yoda, Tarful, and Chewie weren’t involved as they were probably trying to avoid detection getting Yoda off planet and it didn’t look like the Wookies had any communications between each other, such as radios or anything like that, so they couldn’t tell them that the clones had turned. But what reason would the clones have anyway to attack their allies? The droids wouldn’t have been turned off or given orders to stand down until Anakin went to Mustafar to kill the leadership, I don’t think anyway. 

All the planets would end up being controlled by the empire anyway so it probably doesn’t matter if it was Kashyyk or Ryloth, or Mandalore and that the imperial army would have come in to take them but having the clones do most of the dirty work made it easier. Still just something I would like to know that I haven’t been able to find any definitive answer to since Order 66 was about the Jedi and Jedi collaborators and not focused on friendly planets to the Republic.",Does anyone know if Order 66 also included planets that were allied with the Republic?

StarWars,"This is gonna be a three-part post, btw


TL;DR: The OT tells a lot of great story, PT not as much. ST at first is too much of the OT, then basically useless, then doesn’t feel like Star Wars.

This might be a bit of a lengthy post, so be prepared to read:

#First: The Original Trilogy

The reason why we all love the OT is because it manages to incorporate so much story and action into a (relatively) short time span.

**A New Hope:** Lucas combines the action and story of two movies into one. It is a 2:05 movie about space magic, an evil Empire, and a small rebellion. While so many different movie franchises would make the story of New Hope into two different movies, Lucas makes a giant story fit into one movie. Throughout it, the audience is left wondering about what could happen next, who will do what, and how it is so great. We see tons of action, adventure, and cool space magic. We get to see the farm boy learn of his family, the power in it, the power in him, we see him find friends, see him join a rebellion, and we see him take down a giant, planet-destroying space station. It makes us think that we, we who are just normal people, could take on anything if we just have friends and hope. Most movies would end with the Death Star plans getting into the hands of the Rebellion leaders, or soon before or after. Not with George Lucas.

**The Empire Strikes Back:** The sequel to an amazing and wonderful movie, TESB continues the story, taking place not too long after ANH. Instwad of seeing the same thing as before, or something similar, we see the characters together, on Hoth, preparing to leave and defend themselves because the Empire is attacking. After the battle, Luke goes to Dagobah to receive training from an old Jedi master. He was told to go by none other than his now-dead temporary master, who we see on Hoth. Leia, Han, Chewie, and Threepio go off to find one of Han’s friends who can help. While Luke is on Dagobah, we see some cool things. One such thing, that is funny, is a small, green alien who talks funny. It is soon revealed to be none other than Master Yoda himself. Luke trains, and finds that his friends need his help. He goes off to Bespin. At Bespin, we find Vader and the Empire. Threepio was taken, dismantled, and almost melted down. We see our heroes go through some tough stuff. Han is frozen and taken, and Luke fights Vader. The audience is surprised to find out that Vader is Luke’s father. Instead of joining his father, Luke intentionally falls down the huge shaft they are in. He is rescued by Leia, Chewie, and Lando, and they go off, Luke and Vader connecting through the Force. It ends with Luke’s hand being replaced by a more robotic hand.

This movie has a wonderful story, and great twists. It is no wonder why it is loved by so many fans.

**The Return of the Jedi:** I will make this shorter. Just like the rest, it tells a great story with great action in a 2-hour timespan. We meet the cute little Ewoks, see a battle between the Rebels and Ewoks versus Vader’s personal legion of stormtroopers, the 501st. Luke meets the Emperor, and battles with Vader. We see Lando fly the Falcon into the Death Star, and see Vader turn on his master, throwing him down a shaft into the reactor of the second Death Star, which is destroyed soon after. It is revealed that Leia is Luke’s sister.

A massive Empire is taken down, a powerful and evil ruler is destroyed. Although we are left with a great many questions about what happened before the movies, they end.

That is, until May 19, 1999.","My thoughts on the Star Wars movies, and why we do/don’t like them"
StarWars,"Hey everybody, long time star wars fan here. My earliest days of playing videogames were playing the original battlefront games as well as the lego games on my PS2. Now there's a sale on lots of classic SW games on Xbox, and I'm wondering if anyone has any input to which I should get. The ones on sale that I don't own are

Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Jedi Starfighter, KOTOR, KOTOR 2, Republic Commando, and The Force Unleashed 2. I played all of these with buddies as a kid, but never played through them in their entirety, and remember absolutely nothing from their stories (been dodging spoilers for years haha).

Which games do you recommend picking up? They're all $5 so the only question is the actual quality of the game.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, and May the Fourth be with you!",Xbox One May the Fourth sale suggestions?
StarWars,"At the end of the day it’s just Star Wars without the Sequels you don’t know what happens next, without the Original Trilogy you don’t know what happens next. Everybody who likes Star Wars (most) argue over which trilogy is better. I don’t get it, there is no point of it. People should stop complaining about what is better. Yes, I know it’s other people’s opinions but people just argue with it without dealing that the opinion is just a opinion and there is nothing to fight about. It’s all just a waste of time..",I don’t understand why people hate different trilogies from Star Wars.
StarWars,"So, here’s some context. I wouldn’t call myself a fan, but it’s just such big pop culture that I’ve watched enough of it. 

Currently, I’m doing a marathon of the recent trilogy on Disney+. I’ve even got my little Lando Calrissian Funko pop next to me. (Also got all my “refreshments” with me) 

But to be honest, I ain’t even that into it. I watched the first trilogy... thought it was okay. Empire was great though. 

I watched the prequels, they were god awful. I’ve never seen the Disney trilogy before. 

Basically, I want to understand why do people love about it so much? Is there something that I’m under appreciating about it? 

Basically, I’m giving it a shot. Make me a fan.","Let’s have a conversation, Why do you like Star Wars?"
StarWars,"I know many people are big fans of the prequels and in turn the clone wars and I’m not here to bash that. I’m more interested in putting a new spin on The Clone Wars. (This idea was heavily inspired by RedLetterMedia in their Mr. Plinket review of the prequels) now this change is made to fix one of the biggest issues I have with the prequels. The clones and the clone wars don’t feel impactful. Coruscant doesn’t change during a war where they are apparently running out of money. (I know this is talked about in the clone wars tv show) There’s also the clones, which in the original trilogy aren’t any different than droids. We have no reason to care about them because they seem to be an infinite resource, we’re told in the movies they’re resources are thinning and spreading out across the galaxy but we don’t really see it. (Again I know the clone wars tv show makes the clones much more interesting and like able) in this idea those issues would be gone. Instead of the republic having clones, the Sith would. The republic would instead use able bodied men and women to fight in the war. This would 1, add some diversity to the soldiers and 2, make us feel more for them because they are real people not clones. In this idea the Sith would have the clones. Instead of humans being cloned, they would be some sort of monster from an outer rim planet. There would be foot soldiers that could use blasters or they could be more vicious and use claws to tear apart republic soldiers. There could also be higher up generals that could either be a different alien or not a clone at all. They would be recruited instead. Now since there would be actual citizens of the republic as soldiers we would see a slow collapse of frequented places like Coruscant. That’s pretty much all I have for now but tell me what you think of it!",The clone wars
StarWars,"Hello there,

I finally watched the sequel trilogy in its original audio (english) and since I love learning about accents I noticed something confusing. Finn's actor is English and in all of hos interviews he's got a very British accent. So why is he using and American accent in the film?

In Star Wars most the tendency goes to the Empire (later the First Order) being played by Brits (Vader, the empirial generals, Snoke, Hux etv) and the good ones are portrayed by Americans (Luke, Leia, Han, Poe etc).

Can someone explain, please? Maybe Finn hasn't got an American accent at all but something different? Thanks fpr answering.

StarWars,"I just want to talk about my favourite moment in all Star Wars media. A moment in a Legends novel, where a character embraces their greatest flaw and turns it into their greatest strength. A moment that I find very relatable and personally inspiring in my life. 
Ganner Rhysode, a Jedi Knight who in his own words, was not a hero, just a sidekick, embracing his own inner need to be THE hero, accepts that he only needs to pretend to be the hero, and in doing so provides Jacen Solo with the time to talk to the Dhuryam on Yuuzhan'tar. 

""  I don't have to be a hero, he thought in silent wonder. All I have to do is pretend. ""Like I said, I'm just the sidekick here,"" he said carelessly. ""My job is to make sure the real hero lives long enough to do his. That whole `needing to be a hero' thing has always been my greatest weakness."" Jacen stared at him, into him, through him, as though he knew him to his very core, and he nodded. ""But you should know that it can also be your greatest strength. Give yourself permission to use that strength, Ganner. You'll need it.""  ""

Ganner becomes a legend to the Yuuzhan Vong because of his actions on that day and provides my favourite quote from legends in the process - 

""No. I am Ganner. This threshold is mine. I claim it for my own. Bring on your thousands, one at a time or all in a rush. I don't give a damn. None shall pass.""",May the 4th always reminds me why I love Star Wars (Spoilers for Legends Novel - Traitor)
StarWars,"I was born in 2002. 
The Original Trilogy is something sacred to me. But I grew up with Prequels. And later with the Clone Wars. It was the most influencial thing in my childhood and I am glad that this chapter of my life is now finished.

I also wanted to thank Dave Filoni and his crew for creating this beautiful show.
Thank you Matt Lanter, James Arnold Taylor, Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, Tom Kane and many other voice actors who I will probably never forget.

StarWars,"After watching the first episode of the documentary about the behind-the-scenes of The Mandalorian, I've realized how much each single director and producer was involved emotionally in the project. Not only Filoni (this guy has so much passion, love and care about Star Wars as no one could, you can see that in his eyes while he's talking about his first interview and meet with George). To be honest I did not expect Favreau also. He's been a leader in the development and as I know this is one of the first projects he is involved directly (correct me if I'm wrong).
To sum up, it was an interesting introduction episode.",The making of The Mandalorian
StarWars,"I know a lot of people have made the same point, but I think it the complaints behind the Matez Sisters arc goes beyond ""It's not good""

My opining is that if you took out the entirety of episodes 5-8 of The Clone Wars Season 7, not only would the series miss nothing, but it would actually make it better. Imagine if in Episode 9 of Season 7, after Anakin saves the day he gets a message from an unknown person only for that person to be Ahsoka. It would be a cool reveal. 

One of my major problems with the Martez Sisters Arc is that they don't do much aside from reintroducing Ahsoka or Maul to the series and having Ahsoka team up with Bo Katan.  I'm also pretty sure there's a time jump between Episodes 8 and 9 of Season 7 so the episodes leading up to that don't really matter

I think if everything Ahsoka did after she left the Jedi Order was left a mystery, then it would be better because we would use our imaginations to learn what happened up to that point. 

Now your probably thinking about what other arc the show could have done. I believe the show should have adapted the comic series **Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir**. The comic was about what happened to Maul after his cliffhanger in Season 5 of The Clone Wars. This would not only reintroduce us to Maul, but would also give an explanation as to how he got back to Mandalore, because if you haven't read the comic, how he escaped from Sidious after Season 5 is given about as much explanation as to how Palpatine came back in The Rise of Skywalker.

Another thing it would do is let us see characters like General Grievous, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, and Mother Talzin one last time before the series is over because those characters were mostly absent from the final Season and it would be great to see them again. It also introduces people who haven't seen Rebels (Like myself) to characters like Gar Saxon. Since I haven't seen him before he was just a random Mandalorian commander. Plus the comic is legitimately great and I suggest you read it

That's my opinion at least",The Martez Sisters arc shouldn't have been made because there is another arc the show could have done instead

I watched the entirety of the show, but I really would like to watch the finale with my family who have seen everything that is live-action Star Wars. They never really wanted to watch the animated shows though.

If I give them the basic information about the show (Anakin has a padawan, Darth Maul is back etc.), will they be able to understand and enjoy these episodes or would it be better to just watch it only with someone who has also seen “The Clone Wars”?",Can you watch the four-episode finale of “The Clone Wars” without having watched any episode of the series before?

Back then when we didn't know that we would get season 7 I watched the unfinished episodes several times. And when they announced season 7 I was so excited to see the unfinished episodes ""finished"". I mean there are so many unused opportunities so many episodes that are waiting to get finished and aired but won't. In the end I think that Disney was under pressure because of the fans and just wanted to finish the series. They never really cared and rushed the series. Don't get me wrong I like season 7 but it's just a small part of what it could have been and that they did it doesn't justify how they did it.

StarWars,"I didn’t want to put the name of the other movie in the title for spoiler reasons. 

But the end of TRoS is the exact same as the end of Avengers: End Game (another Disney property). 

Good guys spend the movie getting information that they need to them fight the bad guy. They ending culminates in a giant fight between the good and the bad guys. Just as the good guys seem outnumbered, the rest of the good guys show up. Through light speed in TRoS and portals in End Game. 

The similarities go all the way down to the last moments when Rey and sidious are fighting. Sidious says “I am all the sith” reminiscent of Thanos saying “I am inevitable” then Rey just goes and says “I am all the Jedi” reminiscent of iron man saying “I am iron man”! And upon beating sidious all the enemies are destroyed, exactly like in End Game. 

I refuse to believe this is nearly a coincident. Disney has always been formulaic in their movies  and it feels cheap to use the same ending in their two biggest franchises. I understand it is supposed to be similar to the ending of Episode 6 when Luke, Vader, and Sidious are in the chamber watching the battle happen outside but damn.",[Spoiler] Are we just going to ignore the ending of Rise of Skywalker is the same as another big movie?

I appreciate and try to enjoy every piece of sw content we get. The cw has the best aspects of every trilogy and tells a story with unrivaled depth and character development. This is a show I will fondly rewatch year after year. It means more to me than the creators could know.",How is it that the cartoon became my favorite piece of Star Wars?
StarWars,"I'm so glad the SW:TCW invested in developing Ahsoka's character more. Ahsoka, has became so much more powerful.  The way she leveled up reminds me of how Goku and the Saiyans of the DBZ universe kept breaking through their upper limits. She uses her abilities in many ways we haven't seen before. Using telekinesis to manipulate her light sabers and drill a hole in the ground so her and Rex can escape. Can you say, Darth Traya? She never demonstrated the ability to almost bring a ship out the sky before. She only stopped when she realized that Rex was about to be killed and at that point no one would be left to defend her from incoming fire \[and she didn't want Rex to die either\]. It reminds me of Star Killer (I think) who was known to bring a ship down and out of orbit. But that wasn't cannon. More recently Rey held a ship in flight, like Ahsoka did, in her attempt to rescue Chebacca but may have done so with an assist from Kylo.

So Ahsoka is at least as powerful as Rey. I would guess more powerful if a timeline exists where they would cross paths. I'm gonna have to say that she is way more powerful than when she was ""officially"" with the Jedi Order.

...and what's up with the owl? I know that's a tie in to an earlier saga involving the force weilders (the Father, Son &amp; Daughter) but was one of them, (the daughter) transformed in to that owl?  


Note: I have loads of screen shots from her epic Battle with Maul.

She has been indifferent to Star Wars and I dont push it so this was a collision of both worlds I want to embrace. I immediately went to amazon and got as many Ahsoka books or padawan books i could find in the 3-5 year old category. They were all used but worked out great. 

However I'd like to suprise her with an ahsoka figure or toy but there are none in stores and the ones I find online are marked up 1000%

StarWars,"Alright so now that we got the finale of the Clone Wars, we have seen some retconning of the “Ahsoka” book. A couple questions I have now from what we have seen:
(Forgive me, it’s been a couple years since I read the “Ahsoka” book so if I have anything wrong please correct me.)

1) Does Ahsoka now head to Thabeska and go into hiding followed by Raada? Does this series really change anything from the book?

2) Will we ever find out what happens to Rex in the meantime (outside from what we know from rebels)?

3) It feels like basically all of her flashbacks from the book got retconned, which I would say is mostly for the better (their capture of Maul in the series was much cooler than a ray shield in the book.) Has anyone from Lucasfilms spoke on this and does this have any affect on the rest of the book in your eyes?

4) She still doesn’t know Anakin is Vader right? I mean we saw her feel Anakin turn, but she can’t feel him in the force anymore in the book. Is that just because Anakin is dead, there is only Vader?

They were ""defective"" clones, so would the Republic even have bothered with putting chips in them, or decide to not waste their time doing it?

StarWars,"Just got done watching the last episode, just a couple quick thoughts. Their were a lot of great moments in the final scene but my favorite was Darth Vader looking up into the sky and you see the dark red hue in his eye and could partially see his eye and skin. haunting to think their's someone human still inside the suite. It made me think of the shot in New Hope when you see Vaders face through the mask. Which Ive never researched but I assumed was a complete accident in the film. Made me wonder if that mistake in the film was the influence for that final shot in clone wars. Not sure if anyone knows if someone connected to the film has ever said anything about that shot? 

Also, new topic, theirs gotta be another series with Darth Vader, right? Gotta go looking for Ahsoka, right? Disneys gotta capitalize on this popularity they have with Ahsoka. And add one of the most popular villains ever. That would be a hit. Especially if they stuck with that serious tone that final scene had.

StarWars,"Today, of all days, I celebrate how Star Wars is getting me through lockdown. On March 11th, I and two buddies of mine made a trip to Disney World in Orlando, FL, for the expressed purpose of going to Galaxy’s Edge. We had been planning the trip for about 3 months, and we traveled from three different states to meet there for that one purpose. We didn’t go to any other park, we were there just for Star Wars. As we got closer to the day, we were worried about how the newly (at the time) growing concern over coronavirus would impact our trip. We chose to push forward anyway (keep in mind, at the time the threat seemed minimal. We made that decision based on the info we had - very few cases in the US, and most on the West Coast. In hindsight, knowing what we know now, it was a horrible idea to choose to go, and we would not make the same choice today). However, that day ended up being the perfect day. We woke up early, got to the park an hour before opening...and when I say we got to do everything we wanted to do, I mean everything. We got Group 8 during the lottery for the Rise of the Resistance ride (for those of you who don’t know, this is incredible. We literally got to ride the ride within an hour of the park opening), we got to build custom lightsabers, we rode Smuggler’s Run, we drank Blue Milk, we stopped in at Oga’s Cantina, and I even got the Legacy Lightsaber I wanted from Dok Ondar’s. Everything that could have gone right went right. We marveled at how lucky we were to literally have the perfect Galaxy’s Edge trip. And, it was the first time we had ever taken a guys trip like this. It was amazing...A few days later, Disney announced it was closing down due to the virus. We returned to our respective home states and we were almost immediately put into lockdown. Since then, I’ve looked back fondly on that day as the last true hoorah before going into quarantine. During lockdown I have, of course, been watching the movies over and over  and catching up on TCW and the Mandalorian, and, to be honest, it’s keeping me from going stir-crazy during this craziness. So, today, I’m grateful for Star Wars. I’m grateful for good buddies who share my passion for this amazing world and its characters. And I’m grateful that we got to spend that one perfect day before being locked in. But, above all, I’m glad we made it home safely, and in good health. Stay strong out their friends.

StarWars,"So, when I was young I wasn't really into all the Star Wars hype and haven't ever really looked back at it. My birthday is today (May 4th) and just like every other year people tell me ""MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU"" and ""The Star Wars day is your bday?? Thats cool!"" only so I tell them that I never really got into it.

So I decided that maybe it's time to actually give it a try now, especially with all the time we have now with Corona going on.

Anyways,  I'm 24 now and (spoiler ahead) I know that Darth Vader is Luke's father. I've known that since elementary school just because Star Wars is so huge and the word goes around. But that's the only spoiler I know.

I read that the general recommendation to watch is Episode 4, 5, 6 into 1, 2, 3 

BUT

since I know that Darth Vader is Lukes Father, I read some other thread that with the knowledge of that, it might be more enjoyable to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

So, please tell me what the best watch order for me would be with this knowledge! Thank you :)",Question about watch order
StarWars,"After watching the last 4 episodes of The Clone Wars, I can't help but think Dave should've been involved on the creative side for developing the sequel trilogy. I know he didn't have any film making experience, but he knows how to tell a story and he could've helped Kathleen and co. to create a narrative plan/arc for the sequel trilogy. He could've worked with JJ and Rian in making sure the story was consistent and respected the lore. It's frustrating to watch the sequel trilogy knowing that there was never a plan and many missed opportunities. Does anyone feel like Dave should've been involved with the sequel trilogy? Also, I hope one day, Dave can make his own Star Wars movie, or even a trilogy.",Why wasn't Dave creatively involved with the sequel trilogy?
StarWars,"Hello fellow Star Wars fans. Today is the annual celebration of everything Star Wars and I hope everyone, despite this whole coronavirus stuff is enjoying it. But I feel like this Star Wars day is an end of a legacy that has been established. Today we saw the last episode of the clone wars released, and TLJ released to Disney Plus. I feel like this truly is the end of the Skywalker legacy in Star Wars. We have  filled every gap with standalone stories and series such as the clone wars and rebels to explain everything in between the movies. Skywalker as we know it has no direct descendants still alive meaning the bloodline is lost. Furthermore the next movies will almost certainly not be centered around Skywalker or his family. I may be jumping ahead here but I think this really is the end of the characters we cherished and loved, if you wanna argue otherwise i'm down to hear other opinions. BTW looking into the sunset while listening to binary sunset from Star Wars is an amazing way to celebrate May 4th.",I feel like this Star Wars day is a historic day
StarWars,"I had thought about this for a while now but the whole Skywalker Saga can be summarized with these three words.

The prequels are about the **Rise** of Palpatine and the Empire.
It's also about the **Fall** of Anakin into the Darkside.

The original trilogy is about the **Fall** of the Empire and ultimately Palpatine himself.
In the end it's the **Return** of the Jedi and Anakin into the light with help from Luke.

The sequels are a bit more muddled but still work as in the end the impending **Return** of Palpatine is the catalyst for the final battle.
In the end the **Rise** of Skywalker brings peace once and for all to the galaxy.


You could also apply these three to the trilogies as a whole.

The original trilogy brings the **Rise** of Star Wars into media 
The prequels at the time were seen as the **Fall** since we thought that was the end for Star Wars but with the sequels and media released since than, we are all seeing the **Return**

It's quite poetic.","The Rise, Fall &amp; Return of Star Wars"
StarWars,"I'm 26 and have never seen a Star Wars in my life. I wanted to start watching them now as I have a bunch of time off but idk what order to watch them in. Apparently you don't watch Episode 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc in order? I looked around and people told me to watch this order:

StarWars,"One of the most interesting what-if’s in Star Wars is that Qui-Gon and Maul likely would have aligned in many aspects ideologically regarding their philosophies on the Force and could have united to be a powerful balance against Palpatine in one direction and the Jedi in the other

Qui-Gon’s grey tendencies and Maul’s eventual realization that he was a disposable pawn could have drawn them together toward the center as competent opposition to both the tyrannical oppression of the Sith and the blinding fundamentalism of the Jedi

Sadly, they were ultimately both acting according to a false binary of light and darkness when Maul killed Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan “killed” Maul

May the fourth be with you... always.","My favourite Star Wars moments, shows + movies"
StarWars,"TL/DR at bottom

Watching Star Wars for the first time in a long time for May the Fourth. I was a HUGE fan growing up. So much so I had the dialogue from the while first trilogy memorized. Generally I've fallen out of love with the franchise over the years, starting with episode 1 (I really liked Ep 7 and Rogue 1 though, but not enough to have seen 9 yet). 

Anyway, I'm watching Jedi and it occured to me how little we knew about Boba Fett from the original movies. He was an absolute fan favorite. Iconically so even. But within the movies you don't really get enough info to find him more than passingly interesting (as a more mature viewer anyway). He has a cool look and job, takes a finger wagging from Vader, does one smart thing in tracking the Falcon and then is relegated to being a transporter and dies comically when he finally tries to spring into action in a fight. He's grade-a certified top henchman stereotype and nothing more. 

Of course, there was also his part in the TV special and the hype over the toy and his huge presence in books and fanfic that would come later, but what I described above is all you'd know if you just watched the movies and personally I wouldn't be very impressed by that if I were seeing it for the first time today. 

As a matter of fact, there are a LOT of characters who have had more or less the same treatment in the other trilogies who I looked at and thought ""ok, why should I care about that person"" or ""what was the point of that?"" There's the General Grievouses (sp?) and Cpt Phasmas and a lot more who I don't remember off the top of my head who younger viewers have REALLY latched on to.

It occured to me, watching Boba Fett, the great bounty hunter, get accidentally pushed into a jetpack misfire and fall to his death in the Sarlacc before he ever did anything effective in the fight he was in, that it was always the potential of the character that made him interesting for me as a kid. That wasn't reliant on what was actually on screen. At its best Star Wars is often a fertile playground for childrens' imaginations. In that way it's sort of like a tabletop rpg -it just gives the foundation and you bring the rest. 

I think that's what fans of the original trilogy did with Boba Fett and other characters and it's what younger fans have done with newer characters in the other movies.


TL/DR: In the original (theatrical release) version of Empire and Jedi, Boba Fett's appearances were so small and lacking in development and his death was so anti-climactic that if I'd seen those movies as an adult I would have thought he was pointless. That realization made me understand why younger fans like characters in newer movies I don't, and that those characters are just as good/bad as ones I like.",Boba Fett just made me appreciate how fans of the other trilogies can be so attached to characters that I don't find interesting.
StarWars,"Seen as it's May the 4th I was just wondering what everyone's favourites in each of these categories are:
Favourite Hero: 
Favourite Villain:
Favourite Anti-Hero (Bounty Hunters, etc.):

For me, my choices would be:
Favourite Hero:   Ahsoka Tano
Favourite Villain:   Kylo Ren (or Maul)
Favourite Anti-Hero:   Din Djarin (I think he'd count)
Favourite Film:   Rouge One: A Star Wars Story
Favourite TV Show:   The Clone Wars (and Rebels)

StarWars,"viewing Clone Wars and Rebels for the first time?

TCW's finale was incredible and made me hungry to re-watch Twilight of the Apprentice. Naturally, I've been religiously recommending TCW to my friends over the past few weeks, and I've finally gotten some to bite. I'm curious as to what the optimal way to watch is, though. 

On the one hand, watching in chronological order gives us a better picture of how the show was intended to be delivered, but I don't think that could replace the intrigue of seeing Ahsoka in Rebels and not really knowing what happened to her during Order 66. I really like that feeling of mystery, and I'm glad I had to watch Rebels before TCW wrapped up.

Thoughts?",[CLONE WARS and Rebels SPOILERS] Would you recommend release order or chronological order of....
StarWars,"Literally Star Wars is the most significant piece of art in my entire life. The purity of the philosophy and logic that go into the first six movies, as well as every Clone Wars episode (also Rogue One), is incredible. The philosophical range and potential of those stories is astounding. Quite simply, Star Wars has allowed me to grapple with huge life questions and the moral ambiguity of human existence. By relying on simple logic that is distilled to its most fundamental level and presented in easily digestible stories, Star Wars has created philosophers out of its billions of fans. 

I spent a significant portion of my college years pursuing my interest in philosophy in more academic settings. However, the ability to freely form original and personal philosophical perspectives is almost solely because of Star Wars.

The Dark Side and the Light Side are not foreign concepts to anyone, regardless of whether or not you know Star Wars. Again, simple logic distilled to its fundamental level. Basically, being presented with Bad &amp; Good, and constantly receiving other bits of logic explaining why different characters make their choices to find their paths. I honestly believe that, due to its scope of reach and cultural significance to this day, Star Wars is one of the most important works of philosophy ever made. Also it's an opera with badass music, so...

Thank you George Lucas, John Williams, Lawrence Kasdan, Dave Filoni, Irvin Kershner, and everyone else who was involved with Star Wars*!!!!!

MAY THE 4TH BE WITH US ALL

*Minus the new trilogy because those are films based on Hollywood plots with capitalist motives. While liking those movies is certainly not wrong, I would argue that they never really captured the true essence of Star Wars. It's a space opera told with amazing music and supported by solid logic.",Thank You Star Wars
StarWars,"Hello, this was surely mentioned somewhere in the discussion thread but I think it is interesting enough for a own post.

So my theory is that Rey is possessed by emperor palpatine at the end of TRoS. 

The most obvious reasons is that he has told her that this would happen. ""Destroy me and I will possess you"" (I watched the movie months ago so I am paraphrasing). And she did destroy him. He could have lied. But he is not the character for that and suffers from ""villain explains his plot syndrome"". He also acts in a way that really shows that he wants to be killed by her.

So he sucks all the juice out of Rey and Ben. Rey destroys Sheev and dies and Ben ""heals"" her. But Ben is all out of power and Sheevs reincarnates into Rey. I mean at this point we already know that force lightning and disintegration isn't able to kill Sheevs since he survived the explosion of the death star.

The last hint is the fact that Rey steals the name skywalker. Rey would not do it, her hole journey was about finding her root and accepting who she is and knowing who she is. Rey would take the name palpatin and own it and Rey would rehabilitate the name by her awesome future acts of heroism. Or she would at least take the name Solo to honor Ben and Han (to which she had a faaar deeper connection than to any skywalker).

Sheevs on the other hand would totally take the Skywalker name to profit from the fame and further disguises his true nature.

This theory is way more fun than the other theory, that most things where not really well written and the plot and story was sacrifice in order to hit a few bullet points. 

It definitely makes more sense that the lackluster official interpretation.",About the ending of the Saga
StarWars,"So I'm a bit on the fence on the subject.

The force was very black and white in original films, with the good side of the force just being called ""the force"" which is the natural order of the universe then you have the specially labeled ""dark side"" which is the unquestionably corrupt version of how the force is supposed to be used by villains. This original system lines up well with the whole hero's journey told in a space opera that the film was going for.

However, over the years interviews with Gorge Lucus muddied things up with him claiming the force had to be in place. We see this show up in the prequels with Anakin fulfilling the prophecy of bringing balance to the force, he destroyed the Jedi leading to only two Jedi and two sith (not that they were good movies). The Jedi were more considered with polticis then with spirituality them to misinterpret 'balance' as defeating. In the clone wars The Father and in The Last Jedi Luke both state flat out that balance in the force is literal.

It seems to me with all this in mind a grey Jedi doesn't make a lot of sense 1) if they are a deeply spiritual worshipper of the force then they would want to distance themselves from the corrupt light and dark force disciplines as much as possible so they would drop the 'Jedi' label  2) If you follow the above you'll see how the 'balance of the force' doesn't really seemed thought all the way through. While this is interesting we, unfortunately, don't see how the light side corrupts people physically and mentally similar to the way the dark side does which really undermines the balance dynamically. 3) Grey Jedi are at the heart of it (in my opinion) a video game mechanic so protagonists can use the force for attacking spells without worrying about turning evil but that disregards how Yoda explains the force work in TESB movie.",How does everyone feel about Grey Jedi

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Episode 8. But it's still Star Wars so I still like it. Solo had a lot of mixed reviews, but personally I loved it. It was an awesome, compelling, and believable backstory to an amazing, super important and beloved character. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and if you don't like some of the movies or shows, that's perfectly fine. But I choose to love every series, movie, game, and book for what they are. Beautiful extensions of the universe and (somewhat now convoluted because the Disney EU murder) continuity of the Star Wars franchise. I'm not a happy hippy with Disney myself, I love the EU so much, and was and am upset when The Mouse just up and killed it, but that's within their rights as its current owners. It's not like their banning it, the stories are right there. This post got a little Rant-like, sorry. But why choose to hate something that's brought so many of us joy?

May the Force Be With You!","Yo, Shout Out to the Sequel Trilogy this Star Wars Day"
StarWars,"Thank you. 

Thank you for introducing us to Ahsoka Tano, who is now one of the most developed characters in all of Star Wars. This show allowed us to see Ahsoka slowly grow from an immature child to a kind, patient, caring person. She was betrayed by the people she was closest to but continued to believe in what the Jedi stood for rather than what they had become. Down to the last episode, refusing to hurt or kill the clones after they turned on her is such a fantastic display of her character.

Thank you for bringing Maul back from the dead and turning him into a fleshed out character with motivation and purpose. We got to see him change from a crazed, revenge driven maniac to a calculated, plotting mastermind who clearly learned a thing or two about complex plans from his master. What was once simply a tattooed badass is now, once again, one of the best characters in all of Star Wars.

Thank you for bringing life and personality to the clones. What were once a nameless, identical mass of soldiers is now a group of people with personality and identity. The Umbara Arc is one of my favorites from the entire show and stars almost entirely clones.

Thank you for showing Anakin Skywalker's friendship with his master as well as his turn to the dark side. This show succeeds where the prequels largely fail. We see Obi Wan and Anakin bond and banter, and giving Anakin an apprentice was one of the best decisions George Lucas had. His relationship with Ahsoka is incredible to watch as it morphs over time, allowing us to see his own internal change.

I love this show and I love Star Wars. I am so glad there is still a piece of this franchise that the entire fanbase can unite around. Whether you love the OT, prequels, sequels, or any combination therein, we are all Star Wars fans in one way or another. This show gives me hope for the future, but it also has made me grateful for what it has given us.

StarWars,"Clone Wars just ended today and all the Star Wars films are on Disney+. I want to watch the final arc of Clone Wars, which occurs alongside Revenge of the Sith, in a way that paints the complete picture. In Clone Wars, Obi Wan and Anakin go off to do what occurs in Revenge of the Sith, and multiple times the show and movie intersect. What I want to do is watch Revenge of the Sith and the final arc of Clone Wars so that I get the whole story at once. My problem is I don't know which to turn on first and when to switch over between movie and show. I know scenes like the holonet conversation with Asokah and the Council happened right after Anakin left the conversation, so I can watch that scene in Revenge of the Sith and as soon as Anakin leaves, put on the same scene's continuation in Clone Wars. I want to do this with the whole Revenge of the Sith film and Clone Wars final arc. Any help on timing this would be appreciated. I read yesterday that someone is editing Revenge of the Sith into a 3.5 hour extended edition including Clone Wars scenes, but I don't think the person making it will release it publicly because of copyright concerns. Because of such, I want to experience it myself on my own.

StarWars,"It's literally like sticking all the people who control the ship, guns, propulsion, hangar bay,and everything else into a few rooms on the top of a, a prominently displayed, relatively thin pole. That too, in a mass produced military grade ship. The venator took care of this to some extent with it's dual bridge design but even then it isn't that secure. Look at the executor super star destroyer in RoTJ. The 19 km super dreadnought was foiled by one stray A wing that hit it in the bridge. They have advanced technology and put it into a raised bridge instead of something like an enclosed bridge that relies on camera feeds or something. I don't know. But why the raised bridge?

StarWars,"The clone wars finale was amazing. I love how it crossed into Revenge of the Sith. It was emotional and amazing. Arguably some of the newer best Star Wars made. But I still have some questions. 

1. Did Commander Wolffe go along with Order 66? Rex said in Rebels that Gregor and Wolfee's chips got removed. To be honest I thought the chips were going to be removed earlier this season or they were going to be removed after Rex found out about what Fives told him. What about Gregor as well I don't understand how he survived the Rhydonium explosion in season 5. Did he go back to the Republic? 
2. How did Palpatine know where Ahsoka was. Did he tell Rex to execute order 66 in general or did he know about the Siege of Mandalore? It was an emotional scene though. 
3. How much time passed when Vader found Ahsoka's lightsabers? 
4. People say a Clone Wars season 8 is coming out or that Lucasfilm has more stories to tell about Ahsoka. Anyone want to explain that? I would be so down for more Ahsoka stories or Clone Wars stories.
5. Why can't Dave Filoni take over Lucasfilm? He's a god when it comes to making Star Wars. He understands the knowledge of George Lucas and the Star wars universe. 
6. How much involvement did George Lucas have with the new season?
7. Is this the last time we are going to see Maul? I thought someone said that after Clone Wars we are going to be taking a ""break"" from seeing Maul for a while since he's been in Star wars so much for the last couple years. I hope we will one day get to see Maul's adventures during the age of the empire. Imagine if he fought Vader. 
8. Did Ahsoka encounter Obi-Wan or Yoda after season 7? I know Ahsoka did a lot of stuff after the fall of the Jedi Order but I haven't read the Ahsoka book. 
9. What happened to the Bad Batch?
10. What are your thoughts on the new season? I loved it and the visuals and story.",Questions I still have.

StarWars,"I just watched the last episode of The Clone Wars and it was so damn good, the whole siege of Mandalore was so good. This coming after Episode IX and once again some controversy like Episode VIII.

But leaving aside the fandom bullshit for a moment, my personal feelings of the last two films were complicated. I think The Last Jedi was directed, acted and executed well and the way it was presented was brilliant and fresh for a Star Wars film and story in general and the character development was top notch. I can say with confidence that I liked it, but I always have to pause a bit before I say I do.

Rise of course is a huge tumble dryer of confusion. It looked cool, it was fun but I feel JJ Abrams was not the right Director for ending the series.

But outside of main films we have had these amazing TV series, we have had a great couple of games (The Star Wars License needs to be spread to other developers not just EA but that's another rant).  The Mandalorian, brilliant. The last season of Clone Wars, brilliant. It is these things that make it feel like a roller coaster you know. Just a crazy ride of highs and lows.

I never want to get off.",Star Wars can be a Roller Coaster sometimes.
StarWars,"1.Maul is kinda overused and I hope he’s finally done.

2.Rebels ruined the end of the Clone Wars for me because Ik where all the characters end up. (I get it tho because they didn’t know that they were gonna get a shot at CW again)

3.I choose to believe Ahsoka died in the temple because that’s where her story should end.  

4.Time travel in rebels is dumb.

5. I choose to believe Ezra also dies before the OT because I don’t like an extremely strong force user being alive when Luke should be the final chance at Vader being stopped/saved.

6.However, I am ok with Cal Kestis maybe living through some of it because he clearly shows he can’t beat Vader and doesn’t strive to bring the Jedi order back to its former glory.

7.The clones didn’t get enough love in the final episode.  Rex got a lot but I feel like they tried to get away from them because of Order 66, but I think it would have been better to go all in.

8.Seeing Jesse (that was Jesse right?) leading the 501st against Rex and Ahsoka was one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve seen.

9.if you couldn’t tell I think most of Rebels is lazy. 

10.I feel like we should have gotten more Obi-wan and Anakin in the final season. (They just needed to do an actual entire season)

11.I feel the end of Domino Squad’s story wasn’t given enough importance in the Bad Batch Arch. 

12.I don’t know if I hate it for emotional or actual good reason but I can’t stand that Rex and Ahsoka never got to say any goodbyes.

13.Im still bothered that we never see Boil again. I feel Waxer and Boil were so cool just never given enough attention.

14. I kinda wish we saw the clone from the beginning of the show again.  The fact that I only have seen 20 some minutes of them but remember Thire, Jek, and Rys is ridiculous and I’m kinda sad about it.  

15.While the fight between Maul and Ahsoka was good and it felt earned in the sense of them being CW characters (You can’t really say Maul isn’t) and surrounded by everything the clone wars cast built, but it felt like a weird moment just because they really aren’t connected. 

16.This is just kinda a personal thing but I legitimately don’t know what to do now because this show has been in my life forever.",The Clone Wars ended and I’m gonna say some maybe controversial opinions

What are the best 3-4 episode of Clone Wars for her to watch to really build up the Anakin/Obi Wan dynamics that lead into Revenge of the Sith?

StarWars,"TL;DR: Instead of focusing on the negative, appreciate the positive. The newest generation of Star Wars is just as amazing as the previous generations, look past the negativity and marvel at the incredible stories we have.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I read the latest of many articles that have been published in the past year or so about the death of Star Wars as we know it. This particular article was published on CNET and detailed some of the universe breaking scenes from the Rise of Skywalker, among other things, that are causing the author to walk away from the fandom. We live in a time where everyone wants to defeat everyone else. Where the immediate reaction to an opposing idea is to tear it down and try to rally others to the opposition. I propose that this mindset is tearing us apart. Instead, we shall unite under the positivity of what we love. The characteristics of Star Wars that each generation of fandom fell in love with, whether your true Star Wars love is the OT, PT, ST, cartoons, EU, comics, Holiday Special or, whatever else, are still alive and well in a galaxy far, far, away.

&amp;#x200B;

First, let's look inward. Yup, at ourselves. Whether you spend your days on the playground, in the neighborhood on your bike with your friends, in the boardroom, in a cubicle, at your desk, or wherever else your life's journey has brought you, I want you to think about your journey. Think about what you are really proud of with your current circumstances. Have you had success? Are you good to other people? Do you take care of other people? Make people laugh? Accomplish goals? Make sacrifices? Each and every person on the planet, from the bouncing baby who just figured out how to crawl all the way to the grandmother passing her wisdom and accomplishments on to her family, has incredible successes earned through the trials of the human experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I want you to pick some of the things you are proud of and focus on the flip side. What have you failed at on your road to that positive outcome? Have you let people down? Failed to accomplish a goal? Didn't live up to your standards at some point? Found some messy bits? Fallen down and gotten back up? At some point in the storyline of your success is some aspect of doubt, failure or, imperfection. It is not all perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Us humans are imperfect to our core. Perfection is not the goal, nor is it even a possibility. How do we even go on then? If we fail on an unrelenting constant basis as people, groups, teams, fandoms, and nations, how do we continue on every day? Because we grant ourselves grace and unite under positivity and the passions we share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Grace. Let's focus on that and then drive this one home. Grace can be described as giving someone or something some ""slack."" It is the opposite of attacking someone when things go sideways. We would not be where we are today without grace. We rely on the concept of grace to coexist! Without grace, we would have bashed each other off of the planet with rocks a long time ago. Despite our best efforts to obliterate ourselves in the name of disagreement, grace always prevails. To grant that grace to ourselves and each other, we must ignore the reflex to tear down what we don't like or disagree with. This can only be accomplished if we get comfortable with the lost concept of civil discourse, the art of respecting your opposition, and finding common ground.

&amp;#x200B;

As members of the fandom, we all fell in love with Star Wars. Usually to the point of being able to look past whatever flaws exist in our favorite piece of Star Wars media. As our society has become more and more critical of everything, we as a fandom have become more and more critical of the flaws in Star Wars. There are problems in the OT, the PT, the ST, the cartoons and, every other bit of Star Wars media. There are problems in all Marvel media. There are imperfections in your car's paint job. There are problems at your favorite restaurant. There are problems at your job, in your closet, with your dinner last night, with your text messages and in every other conceivable facet of existence. But we possess the grace to look past all of that and appreciate the good in each of those things. It's time to start paying out some of that grace.

&amp;#x200B;

On this May the 4th, instead of allowing the dark side of the Force materialize as negativity in your heart about something that you loved so much at one point in your life, allow the light to guide you to all of the positives. Grant Star Wars the grace you grant yourself. So many amazing Star Wars gifts have been given to us in the past couple of years. Find the aspects you love and focus on those today. Then, take that positivity and spread it around, it's contagious.

StarWars,"My first memory of Star Wars is a picture of Jabba in a TV guide. Must have been early to mid 90s. My dad told me it's that movie with the little bears (Ewoks). We recorded Episode 6 on VHS and it became my favourite movie (I know there's tons of ppl that don't like RotJ) and I still like it the most because of the fond childhood memories. I watched it like once a week and almost cried every time Luke burned Vader. From this point on I absorbed everything Star Wars: Magazines, Games (I could't get past level 1 on Super Empire Strikes back on SNES), TOYS TOYS and TOYS again. My room was filled with posters and TIEs and X-Wings. Action Fleet (anyone remember) and self made Lego starfighters.",What is your earliest memory of Star Wars?
StarWars,"Happy May the 4th to all of you!!!  


I feel like getting into Star Wars ""again."" I have always been a super Star Wars fan, but I never really got into lore books etc. I read a couple of Star Wars novels in my life but that's pretty much it. I would like to get more into the lore so I can better know what happens between the movies, know more about the characters, why they decided to do what they did, etc.  


Is there a Star Wars ""History"" book out there so I could learn about all that without having to read every single novel? Kind of like a compendium or all the major events happening in Star Wars? I kind of doubt such a book exists but I think it'd be a good idea to publish one if it has not been done already.

StarWars,"I just think that it wasn’t the fulfilling ending I hoped for. Nothing really happened that episode don’t get me wrong I still liked the episode I just think it deserved a better ending. 

My main point for this:
The dialogue was very lacklustre as all together no one really said anything which worked for me in the previous episode but not this one.

If Ahsoka has to remove the inhibitor chip from Rex then how did Wolffe and Gregor do it.

The episode didn’t give that much to the relationship between Ahsoka and Rex the previous episode did a better job. 

I expected Jesse to die don’t get me wrong I know at this point clones were the bad guys but idk I expected something more from Jesse then for him to just fall to his death at the end.

At the end of the day this is just my opinion I still liked the episode I just don’t think it was as great as people think but people are entitled to their opinions too so I respect people like it. I just expected a grander ending for such a great TV show.","The Clone wars ending wasn’t that great (Just my opinion, everyone is entitled to that)"
StarWars,"I'm not sure how this post will be reacted to but it's my opinion. The way Maul and Ahsoka duel is nothing compared to any fight in star wars history. I know it's not the same animations but their movements are humanlike, Jedi and Sith are fast, strong, capable of moving with fluency, whereas they moved as if they were training. We've seen the ferocity of mauls fights such as the way he fought Sidious, and the speed Ahsoka can duel at, I expected the intensity of the anakin vs Kenobi duel but was presented with a slow fight that is illogical with their abilities. I haven't looked at much but I figure they used human sensors for the duel animation.",The Ahsoka Vs Maul Fight

StarWars,"So in Revenge of the Sith; Order 66 is given and the clones generally react as if they’ve known about the order the whole time and were just waiting for it to be given.

In Clone Wars, we’re led to believe that Order 66 is a secret, even to the clones, and that upon being given the code words; their subliminal programming kicks in and they’re compelled to execute the Jedi. We even see Rex struggle with the decision for a moment before trying to execute Asoka.

That’s fine, I get it that the story changes a bit over time and with different writers.

But my question is; if the order is to execute Jedi; why would Rex attempt to kill Asoka? He (and the rest of the clones) know that she is no longer a Jedi.

They even have to be given a separate order to execute Maul as well (presumably since he’s not a Jedi and would be safe from Order 66).

Furthermore; in Revenge of the Sith; we see Order 66 enacted without any harm coming to Anakin. In fact; he leads an entire clone battalion on the assault of the Jedi temple.

So are we to assume that Order 66 automatically means kill any known force user (except Palpatine) and that Palpatine had to given an additional command (unseen on screen) to all clones that Anakin was safe from Order 66?",Order 66 Question
StarWars,"Personally I have always been enamoured by the direction and story boarding of the Gendy Tartakovski series. There was an ingrained value towards patience and timing in the action scenes, it wasn’t afraid to indulge in its atmosphere or take itself seriously and for that I unabashedly admire it despite the scene where Jas’en wipped out his junk. In addition to this, it withholds the best interpretation of Grievous hands down. Sad that Filoni came down and suppressed him into a cowardly moustache twirler, whom covers up the dubious deeds of his master.

StarWars,"I'm about an hour in, and I've resorted to making this post to alleviate some fo the boredom. There are a few moments so dumb they're funny, but the rest is awful. It's really weird how the animated part comes in for no reason. It was really jarring, but I kinda liked it more than the live-action parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot of strange scenes and really weird universe stuff. I know it's not canon, but seeing English instead of Aurebesh was really strange. The music also was pretty wacky. lots of strange sounds, and it didn't feel like star wars.

I would really like a line of Power of the Force style figures based on the prequels and sequels. 

I wish that for about a week or so everything I know in my head about Star Wars gets erased so I can read novelizations of the movies and see how the characters and ships and worlds look in my mind based on my own imagination.

StarWars,"For me, the Clones were the best part of the show, and I loved every episode where I got to see them interact together. I loved watching the stories of different clones as they go from battle to battle, watching some grow to become veteran soldiers while also seeing many die along the way. At the end of the final episode, the shot of Jesses helmet amongst the grave sites really hurt as I did not just see the sad end to a veteran clone character (who was one of my favorites), but also an end to the stories of the Clones as we saw them in TCW.",Anyone else gutted at the fate of the Clones and the realization that we will not see them on screen anymore?

With clone wars finished, i watched the Mandalorian behind the scenes episode 1. The one thing that stood out was the love and respect from everyone towards Dave Filoni. Can’t disagree with them.

Also Reddit and Instagram have nothing other than love for this man’s work. And what he delivered was beautiful and pure.

I am not a sequel hater, but the work delivered on the clone wars and The Mandalorian is so much better imo.

StarWars,"I’m new to this group but I just wanted to show my appreciation to both Dave Filoni and George Lucas. 

My first language was Spanish and I actually learned English by watching the Star Wars movies growing up. I actually wrote a paper about Star Wars when I was in undergrad regarding how much it shaped me as a person. The series was my life, just like many on this page, and just finishing TCW finale and I am at a loss of words. I cried for Rex, I cried for Asoka, I cried for Anakin. It was satisfying it was to see a finale that had so much raw emotion and I was content with what was written.

Thank you so much Dave Filoni and George Lucas for creating art for the fans that have grown up with the franchise. This is a collaboration that will be missed.

#thankyoudaveandgeorge","Thank you, Dave Filoni and George Lucas"
StarWars,"People conveniently forget that it was Star Wars fans who bit the George Lucas hand that fed them to the point of Lucasfilm/Disney pandering to the hate as to not step on any toes by creating a story of nostalgia seemingly made in a board room. Star Wars fans loved it until they thought about its unoriginality and proceeded to hate it.

So then Star Wars needed to go back to its roots of being a true independent film like the original Star Wars in the sense of one writer/director, George Lucas and Rian Johnson. Rian's independence of the film took Star Wars in new directions and half the fandom complained that their childhood was ""ruined"".

So then Disney played it safe in the middle with rehashed subplots, and now people hate the trilogy.

Disney didn't plan out the trilogy because Star Wars fans are a fucking pest to please. We hate George Lucas, Disney tries to appease us, then we hate JJ Abrams for appeasing us, then we hate independent Rian Johnson for being bold and new, and then we hate JJ Abrams again for going back to the old.

Star Wars fans need to appreciate that they just got a brand new trilogy and accept the films for what they are, not what we want them to be. Let's not forget that the 10 year old girls and boys of today are the priority demographic of Star Wars who, in 10 years, will celebrate the sequel trilogy on reddit just like the prequel trilogy for last decade's 10 year olds.",Star Wars fans can't be pleased
StarWars,"The more I think about it, Maul and Savage is almost everything that I wanted from General Grievous. The similarities are striking.

* Savage is the menacing Jedi killer and managed to rack up a higher body count than Grievous ever did in the show
* He is also trained by Count Dooku
* Maul is the calculating cyborg nemesis of Kenobi that always runs away when he loses
* Maul even got Grievous' legs for a short time
* All three of them also have villain names that are super on-the-nose... 

It seems as if, by including the Zabrak brothers, the writers subconsciously compensated for all those missed opportunities with Grievous.",Maul and Savage filled a hole that Grievous was supposed to occupy
StarWars,"I have never watched the Clone Wars. I'm going to rectify that soon. I was aware that Maul survived Episode 1, but seeing him in Solo left a bad taste in my mouth. This guy said maybe five words in Episode 1 and here he is spouting so much exposition it's like he's an office manager or something. I feel it detracted from the *amazing* duel in Episode 1 and his strong silent presence.

Sheev's return was rushed but made logical sense. The alternative.. introducing a new Sith creature in the final episode.. would be jarring. Where was this dude for eight episodes? And it would dininish Palps as the ultimate bad guy. Having the Emperor reveal himself in the final episode also is consistent with Lucas's and Kurtz's vision of the original nine episode arc.

I will watch the Clone Wars and  I'm sure I'll enjoy Maul there. I have a good feeling about this. Happy Star Wars day.. I love all of you !! Even if our favorite Star Wars may be different. May the force be with you, always.",Maul's resurrection bothers me more than Sheev's
StarWars,"I mean I might be exaggerating but I think Darth Vader is the best villain (at least top 10) that I have seen. Because honestly he is pretty complex, there are times when you think Vader is just a mask that Anakin puts up so that he can excuse his many terrible actions, because if he isn’t Vader then he is a terrible person beyond redemption which is what I guess he views himself as before he meets Luke. 
He believes there is no good in him anymore or at least convinces himself that there is not good in him so that he can’t stop all the terrible things that are happening and have happened because of his actions. But deep down inside he wants himself to be punished for actions that he cannot forgive himself for. Basically he does terrible things to cause himself pain, things that Anakin Skywalker would hate himself after doing.
So essentially Vader is the mask that Anakin puts on (Figuratively and literally) to kind of punish himself for his actions, something that Luke eventually shows him isn’t necessary and that he can stop torturing himself and remove the mask to become Anakin Skywalker again and in that forgive himself for everything he has done. Vader just needed someone to see something that he himself saw within but was in doubt of, that deep down inside he never became a truly evil person, that was he still was a good man and when Luke, his own son (Who would remind him of Padmé) believed that he remembered who he really was beyond the lies of the emperor.

So at least I think that Anakin was always a good man even as Vader but as Vader he was just trying to convince himself very hard that he wasn’t . 

Just a thought what do you guys think? 👀",I love how complex Darth Vader is
StarWars,"I love Star Wars, grew up with it and it played a huge part of childhood. Star Wars the Clone Wars was different though, as I got to live through it in a sense. It kinda grew with me. As I got older, it got better. It was so cool to me seeing what the clones did especially after playing battlefront 2 pretty much daily at one point. I say all this because I didn’t think the clone wars ending would hit me like this. I’m not like super sad it’s ending, especially with an ending this great. But it kinda feels weird. For a long time we all got to speculate what happened (like with the unfinished arcs) but now we know. There’s no more of the clone wars story to tell after this (besides maybe revisiting past parts, but I mean more literally) The story’s there, from beginning to end. It’s actually over. And it was a great ride to apart of. May the 4th be with y’all",I just wanna say this about the clone wars
StarWars,"Star Wars has been a big part in my life as it has been in yours. From the day I saw the first movie I loved it in an instant. We bought the movies, lego sets and collectibles because our love for Star Wars seems impossible. For some of us it was probably the same thing we were bullied for because it was “nerdy” but it didn’t matter because at the end of the day Star Wars gave us the greatest feeling. It is sad to seeing the very thing I grew up on end today but it’s ok because at some point things have to end and without a doubt Star Wars ended with a bang.

Rest in peace to all the heroes of the Clone Wars. The Jedi, who lead valiantly in a war that upended their ideals. The clones, both the legendary and the unsung, who fought to the death in a war they had no part in. The Mandalorians, subjugated time and time again to civil war and cultural upheaval.The citizens of the Republic, forced into a galaxy of chaos by a leader they were forced to believe in. I grew up with this show, and along with the OT, PT, and KOTOR, it basically got me into Star Wars. Hell, it was the only Star Wars that was still coming out when I was a kid. I grew up alongside these clones, their commanders. Back when each battle seemed like a new adventure, each soldier a new hardened hero. I remember back when Hevy was the most developed clone. It seems so long ago now. Seeing this last season, especially these last four episodes has made me insanely grateful for this excellent show, which changed my childhood. To George Lucas and Dave Filoni; to Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, and James Arnold Taylor; to the countless writers, composers, voice actors, animators, and crew members: thank you for making my childhood what it was.

StarWars,"Okay so here’s my thoughts on EP12. I loved this episode it was really good and from a Star Wars fan who’s been watching the movies since the age of 3, to seeing the first clone wars movie when I was 6, I felt this was such a good payoff. I maybe would of included things which may of felt dragged it one and wouldn’t of been as emotional but one thing I would of liked I think would of been even more emotional than it already was. The things I would of loved to happen was Ahoska and Anakin to have one last conversation maybe just before he’s turned to the dark side or maybe just after, but that may of contradicted Rebels because I’m pretty sure Ahoska didn’t know that Anakin was Darth Vader till rebels. Another thing I would of loved which I think they missed out was how rex found Wolffe and Gregor, I think that would of been cool which they could of made a whole episode over however if they just had a cut where it was nothing to do with Ahoska then it could of broken up emotional tension. One thing I would of loved was when Darth Vader walked up to Ahoskas light saber on which I think was Hoth, Vader picked up her lightsabers and maybe with a sad voice said “Ahoska” and then it cut to Ahoska and she opened her eyes and said “master?” Or maybe not switching to Ahoska but they definitely should of made Vader say something. However even though I listed a lot of thing I think it was a great episode and a great ending. One of the best TV series ever and 100% the best animated Tv show. Might have to binge watch the rest of the seasons and then S7. Also happy May 4th",My thoughts on EP12 of the clone wars SPOILERS

On that note... Please enjoy part 1 of my Star Wars series. 

=============================================

A young Togruta woman sat at a table with an older Weequay man. The Togruta was wearing a set of dark brown overalls but the straps were tied around her waist instead of over her shoulders. The blue long sleeve shirt she was wearing had the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. Her fingerless gloves were dirty with oil and soot. Her goggles were up on her forehead covering part of her facial markings. She had a stern look on her face as she stared down the Weequay before her, her bare feet tapped in sync with her own heartbeat. 

The Weequay was dressed in high end garments and each finger was covered in expensive jewelry. He sat across from the Togruta and examined her up and down. 

""Are you sure this is the one I called for?"" The Weequay asked one of his many guards and they nodded in response. ""She does not look like she has the reputation you say she does.""

""Looks can be deceiving."" The woman said in a monotone voice not breaking eye contact. 

""I suppose they can. Can I assume you already know what you're hauling for me?"" he said. 

""I do.""

""Your pay?""

""I wouldn't have taken the job if I didn't know the pay.""

""Good. Do you know the route I wish for you to take?"" he asked as he motioned for a guard to come closer. 

She kept an eye on the guard as he approached. ""No."" 

The guard handed the Weequay a holovid and he laid it on the table. A map of the galaxy was projected as he began to talk. The planet Bakura, which they currently resided on, was highlighted, as well as Kalee... Her destination. 

""Why wouldn't you want one of your own men for a trip like this?"" she asked. 

The route is highlighted and it cut through the left, more empty side of the galaxy... The Unknown Regions. Suddenly, she understood why he wanted her. 

""I don't value you as much as my own men. No other pilot I could find was willing to do a run like this even for a high price."" The Weequay said. 

She contemplated her job for a moment as she studied the route laid before her. He wanted her to swing past both Jeddha and Ilum into incredibly dangerous and unmapped territory away from any and all established hyperspace lanes. This path alone would take her a month to traverse so she'd have to stock up on rations and whatnot before the trip. 

""I need upfront payment. Thirty-five percent at the minimum."" she said. 

The Weequay looked almost stunned at the request. ""And what for?""

""You want me to make the trip without starving to death, don't you?"" The woman said. 

He nodded without a word and motioned the same guard towards a vault. The money is exchanged, they go over the last few details, and they said their goodbyes. 

""It's a pleasure working with you, Joren Kay. Don't make me regret this."" The Weequay said as the Togruta takes her credits and leaves. She restocked her supplies and departed the station on Bakura and flew into orbit in her Ghtroc 720 light freighter. She programmed the coordinates for Zonama Sekot, as that was where she'd have to slingshot her trip from to resupply. 

Joren's BD unit, BD-9, appeared from a compartment on the other side of the cockpit and jumped into her lap. 

""Hey, Bud. Good to see ya. This one is gunna be a different one from what we're used to."" Joren said as she sent the ship into hyperdrive. 

BD-9 looked at her and tilted his head in a curious way. She filled him in on the details as she got up and headed back to the living quarters with BD riding on her back, avoiding her lekku the best he could. She said down on the couch and laid back. 

""Wake me up in an hour."" she said. BD nodded and nuzzled up on her belly as he waited patiently for her nap to finish. 

An hour passed and BD woke her up as the ship was only minutes from it's rendezvous at Zonama Sekot. After staying in stable orbit for a few rotations, she punched the ship into sub-light speed as she began her journey into the Unknown Region. A few days go by of nothing but rocks flying by. The advanced autopilot kept the freighter from hitting anything it couldn't sustain at this speed so that Joren and BD could play their games in the living quarters to pass the time. 

Little do they know that their ship has gathered the attention of a much bigger ship just outside of their sensors.",[Fan-Made Story] Lucrehulk: Genesis

StarWars,"Ok so before you come at me with blasters hear me out. This is just what I see looking at the movie and the clone wars tv show. So we know all the movies 1-9 at least not counting the other prequels. Are about Anakin skywalker and the skywalker line but think about it though is it really? We knew that it was the emperors plan to  eventually take over the republic for himself and transform it into the empire. Anakin was just a piece of his plot so he could set it in motion. Think about it how would the separatist know about certain attacks or information only the Jedi and republic had? Well that’s because the emperor was pulling strings, telling the separatist What was going on. Meanwhile he was also the big cheese of the separatist and eventually when everything came in circle with what the emperor wanted he got rid of the last separatist. So to conclude it’s really about the rise and fall of the republic and a story about a crazy man who wanted to rule the galaxy for him self Anakin was just a piece of his step, along with Darth Maul, Count Dukuo and General Grievous. Also 7-9 were just away to try to rebuild his empire but it obviously failed.",What if Star Wars is not really about Anakin skywalker or the skywalker line
StarWars,"So with the final episode of the clone wars series out and may 4th being upon us, I decided to put together a complete watch order for the movies, tv series, and major video games included in the Disney canon, going so far as to split up revenge of the sith between the movie and the siege of mandalore to the best of my ability. I did not include novels, comics, or any minor video games such as Star Wars commander (the game is about to be shut down anyway). Enjoy, and may the 4th be with you all!

StarWars,"Ok so I’m rewatching the prequels for the umpteenth time but first in a few years and this is about the closest I’m ever going to come to seeing these movies as though for the first time. I had a revelation.

Episode I always felt a little disjointed from the rest of the trilogy to me. It takes place much earlier, doesn’t involve the Clone War, and Anakin’s story feels shoehorned in as he has little to do with the overall narrative. So why start the trilogy there instead of giving us three movies set during the Clone War?

In Episode III Anakin is devastated when the Jedi Council won’t grant him the rank of master, way more upset than is justifiable. It had never really struck me as that weird because he’s obviously lustful of power but what about this- Anakin was born a slave, had to endure insults because of it but more importantly had to think of Watto as his master; he gets freed and joins with the Jedi where he doesn’t escape the masters of his enslavement- everywhere he looks is someone else he has to call “master.” When the moment finally came for him to be the master, after all his training and the heroics he performed on behalf of the republic and the Jedi, the rug is pulled out from under him. “We do not grant you the rank of master,” Mace Windu tells him disdainfully.

No wonder he turned to the dark side. With the Sith certainly there is a master and an apprentice but both of them are lords and that sounds way more impressive than just being a master.",Slave Master Lord
StarWars,"I suppose probably not as it was kept a secret that Anakin and Vader were the same person for more than a decade after Endor, and there's no indication Rex was ever privy to that secret.  

But perhaps that during their years with the Rebellion he told Luke about his adventures and bond with Anakin and Luke would let him know about his General's end.  (Heck come to think of it, they could reasonably retcon it so that Rex was source of most of Luke's understanding about the man his father used to be.)",Rex was on Endor -- do you think he paid his respects at Anakin's funeral pyre?
StarWars,"The clone wars series finale very much left me wanting more. First of all the actual runtime of the episode was only around 19 minutes, making it the shortest episode by far. Second the whole thing less the last 2 minutes was just ashoka and rex escaping a falling cruiser, didnt have anything to do with the jedi or order 66 other than the inherent fact that they were trying to kill ashoka and rex. That episode didnt leave me with emotions like episode 11 did.

I feel like they could've done a 40 minute episode and put more than just ashoka and rex in it. Like anakin slaughtering jedi and obi finding dead younglings or at least something more like an emotional scene/remake of all the clone wars jedi weve come to love being shot down by their clone troopers. Was very underwhelming in my opinion.",I'm underwhelmed.
StarWars,"TL;DR Master George Lucas needed a TV show and a good director as his apprentice to fully execute his vision on Anakin Skywalker.

There is no doubt that George Lucas is a creative genius. However that doesn't neccessarily translate to storytelling genius, which is evident in his questionable directing in the prequels.

However with a good director like David Filoni who can take George Lucas's ideas and creativity and channel them into a much more coherent storytelling format that the masses would find compelling, Lucas' vision for Anakin's rise and fall is fully described in the story arcs of The Clone Wars - we know how closely the two worked together in creating these episodes.

We truly got to see Anakin gradually and organically grow and mature into a truly heroic Jedi warrior with his infamous fatal flaws of attachment and emotional outbursts, which slowly and graudually grew more apparent. We saw the final straws that broke the camel's back in Revenge of the Sith when he finally falls to the dark side, but we got to see the rest of the load being added on one by one in The Clone Wars.

That part you may probably have heard before many times, but it's probably no coincidence that it fit in so seamlessly between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, because that was what George Lucas wanted to show us from the very beginning - he just couldn't coherently form it into a compelling story that we would enjoy. He tried showing us key parts of Anakin's life and events that would cement his downfall into the dark side, but it only partly came through for the audience in the movies. However with a medium like a TV show to work with alongside his apprentice David Filoni who was a far better storyteller, his vision of a truly heroic Anakin Skywalker with fatal flaws that were unfortunately amplified over time was truly realised.

There's a reason why those of us who grew up watching The Clone Wars were hit a lot harder by the fall of Anakin Skywalker. We were simply fortunate enough to have grown up watching George Lucas fully execute his vision on the character.",The Clone Wars completes George Lucas' vision for the prequels

StarWars,"I'm not here to discuss how good the movie is. I dont really like in the context of the whole franchise at all. However, I just absolutely fucking love watching that first little sequence. Like it's just so fucking absurd and hammy like Palpatines back! Kylo Ren is running around killing people Adam Driver is looking kick ass as ever. The shots are really satisfying to watch. And then the way palpatine delivers ""the dark side is a pathway to many abilities"" like it's his catchphrase. I dont know it's just so bombastic. Even though it still would have had a lot of problems I'm sure, I wish the film kept that same chaotic confident energy throughout, would have made for a much more entertaining movie for me.

StarWars,"I always watched the prequels, and could never find much redeeming about anakin. He came off as a petulant teenager and frankly a creep who u was half convinced used a mind trick to get padme to fall for him. 

Then I watched TCW starting in January, and caught up about halfway through the seventh season...this anakin was tragic. He was amazingly likable, good, kind, and funny. The thought of him falling to the dark side is almost unfathomable, which is why I wish the prequels would have showed him like that...it would have been far more effective. This anakin falling has very empty, and his fall is very Shakespearean.

In any case, I am just having a hard time coming to terms with him falling to Vader, and once again I apologize because I’m sure this is a tired topic but just wanted to post this as a first time clone wars person.","I’m sure this has been discussed a billion times, but I’m new to clone wars, and after finishing them I simply can’t get over anakin turning."

So i went about reading up on some of the canon, after return of the Jedi there were two other Emperors, there's the battle on jakku, theres an entire story where leia attempts to run for the Senate of the new republic but it gets revealed that her father was vader and ultimately fails. Seasons can have time skips as you would eventually have to reach a time close to TFA.

StarWars,"I read an article just now titled ""Star Wars Has Lost Its Mystique And Rise Of Skywalker Is To Blame"". It's goes on to discuss how alot of the decisions made in the 9th film ruined Star Wars and more specifically some of the ideas put fourth in The Last Jedi. I've seen this sentiment echoed a few different times and I believe it's misguided and inaccurate. I'll try to explain why.


Make no mistake about it, neither the 8th or the 9th film are perfect. They're both far from it but to blame the shortcomings of one on the other is overlooking the real issue. The fact of the matter is that Disney, for some odd reason, chose to hire two different directors for such a huge project. It's clear to me that despite what they may say, they were not on the same page and it really hurt the flow of the trilogy.


I'm not here to bash Rian Johnson, it was rumored that he may get his own trilogy in the Star Wars universe. If that were to happen I'd watch it and most likely enjoy it. As a stand alone film, The Last Jedi is an enjoyable watch. However as part of the sequel trilogy it's a mess that does more harm than good. 


Alot of his choices are baffling and show the lack of cohesion between him and Abrams. Listing a few, the casino scene is unnecessary, killing Snoke with no explanation of his back story is unsatisfying, Leia floating back into the ship was laughable, the Holdo manuever is questionable at best, Luke's character choices I don't particularly like and Roses character similar to the casino scene is just bad and unnecessary. 


People take issue when you bring up some of these things. Two in particular I'll address my reasoning for. First Luke's character, people like to talk about subverting expectations when it comes to this film. That's all well and good but there's a way to do it and then there's just doing it for no reason. I feel alot of the choices in this film don't fit the overarching narrative of the trilogy or Star Wars in general. This to me is definitely one of them, I just don't believe this is what Luke would become. It feels like a betrayal of his character and a forced way to subvert our expectations. 


The second issue I'll address is Rose's character. Completely irrelevant, poorly written and just no need to be in the movie whatsoever. You say things like this and people try to say you're sexiest or racist. Look I don't care if it was a man, woman, black, white, Asian, Latin, Wookie, Rodian or any other alien race from the Star Wars universe. Kelly Marie Tran is a fine actor and it's not her fault the character she was given sucks. I have no animosity towards her but I do think the writers did her a disservice. It was clear from the first film that Finn and Rey have a connection of sorts. But for some reason they throw Finn into this relationship with Rose that ultimately leads nowhere and just feels off when looking at the trilogy as a whole. Another clear example of the directors simply not being on the same page.



I want to be clear that I don't blame Rian Johnson. I don't blame J.J. This to me comes down to the baffling decision to hire different directors for a trilogy as massive as this one. I'd love to know what the full vision of J.J.s trilogy would look like. Don't get me wrong Rise of Skywalker has its fair share of issues too. All the ""course correcting"" it did, along with some of the conclusions it arrived at are not great in their own right. But I feel alot if this has to do with what Rian left him to work with. 


Both of these films can be enjoyable to watch. But the lack of cohesion is what frustrates me the most. It's clear to me that Rian's movie went against alot of what J.J. had planned and that is unfortunate. More than anything I blame the studio for this and instead of us arguing why we dislike one or the other or both. I think it's important we take a step back and understand why things turned out the way they did. 


I'm of the opinion that J.J. should have written all 3 of these films. Then as I said I'm sure I'd enjoy a separate Rian Johnson trilogy set in the universe. It's a shame this is what we ended up with. As far as an overarching narritive goes what we got is kind of a mess and leads to alot of dissention in the community. To blame the final film and say it ruins Star Wars is unfair to me. As does saying that same thing about the 8th film. They both have flaws but the problem to me is the lack of cohesion between the two directors and not the films themselves.",The real issue with the sequel trilogy
StarWars,"In the movies &amp; Clone Wars TV series, the light side force users who become force ghost only talk to the people they personally knew. Qui gon only talks to Yoda, Anakin and Obi-wan, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin only talk to Luke, Luke &amp; Leia only appear to Rey, etc. The only situation where this wasn't the case was that moment in ROS where Rey fights Palpatine, but given that was presented as a pivotal moment in the force, it seems like an exception to the rule. This would explain why Anakin never appeared &amp; spoke with Rey or Ben.",THEORY: Light side force users can only communicate to those they have a connection with.
StarWars,"I’m getting more into the expanded universe and was just wondering. I’m not trying to preach an agenda or looking to demonize Star Wars or talk about anything post-RotS. Please do not come here to rant about your opinions on the writing and/or casting of the movies or sexism/gender theory in the real world. 

Are there examples of Jedi being sexist or thinking female Jedi are inferior? Is it something that’s been phased out entirely within the order with how young everyone is when they join? I assume it still exists on other planets and in other cultures but I’m looking for information specifically on how Jedi viewed sex (and how they viewed gender if that comes up at all).",Did sexism exist within the Jedi Order?
StarWars,"I just finished watching the last episode ever of Clone Wars and I swear to god I almost cried. Not because the ending was particularly emotional or anything, though it was, but because this show was my childhood. I remember going to the theatre to see the movie, stopping at Walmart and McDonalds on the way home so my parents could buy me a happy meal and some Star Wars action figures. I was just an outlet for fantasies and creative thoughts back then. No personality beyond trying to be the funny guy. I guess some things never change. This isn’t just about the Clone Wars. It’s about what’s changed. Everything has gotten better. But, in a way, they’ve gotten worse too. That outlet I had when I was a kid has died. What was thoughts and love for the present has now become hope and thoughts for the future. I’m a different guy than I was back then. But, one thing I’ve always had in my life has been Star Wars. Since the day I pointed at a funny shape on a Disney World map, it’s always been here with me. I’ve always watched the movies, read the books, and played the games. Back then it was my shitty plug and play R2-D2 console. But it was also Clone Wars. I got older, and Minecraft came along. I lost that Plug and Play somewhere along the way. And when I tired of Minecraft, what did I have? Star Wars the Clone Wars. There always seemed to be another episode in my DVR. And as always, I was happy to watch it. I love Star Wars, and with it’s future uncertain today, I felt the need to take the time to reflect. Here’s to you, Clone Wars. To the 8 year old kid inside me, you’ll always be awesome. You’ll always be inspiring. You’ll always be a part of me. Cheers.",A Toast to The Clone Wars

On my 4K disc of Rogue One, at precisely time index 2:07:11 the audio (which is just the end credits music at this point) ""pops"" (you can actually hear a little ""pop"" noise) and it becomes instantly louder than it was before that. This is using the Dolby Atmos track btw. I don't understand why this is happening. I looked at the 4K digital version (using the code that came with my disc) and it didn't have this problem, so I know for a fact that this should not be happening and that there is some sort of glitch here. The regular Blu-ray version doesn't have this problem either.

Thank you.",Can anyone here please help me? It's about the Rogue One 4K DISC.
StarWars,"I just watched this right as it hit at midnight. The hype for this did not go unrewarded. The epic buildup through the whole season did not disappoint. 

A notable and sad moment was when Jesse had all of the clones together on the hangar blocking Rex and Ahsoka. Rex was trying to convince them that she wasn’t a Jedi. Jesse accused Rex of violating Order 66 and ordered all of the clones to fire on them. This tore me apart because of Jesse and Rex’s friendship. 

The crash of the Venator was awesome to watch. Ahsoka falling through the air with Rex trying to catch her in the Y-Wing was beautifully animated and action-packed. When they landed, she seemed to feel guilty by what she had done to escape. She buried every clone she could find and dropped her lightsaber on the ground. She walks away.


And... Oh. My. God. The last scene. An Imperial shuttle landing at the Venator Crash Site with snow troopers patrolling the area. We hear mechanical breathing and black boots walking in the snow. Vader walks to the Venator. He observes the graves of the 501st Battalion with Ahsoka’s markings on the helmets piked up. He sees something in the snow and reaches for it. Ahsoka’s lightsaber, covered in ice. He ignites it and walks away. 

The last shot of Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a clone helmet in the snow reflecting Vader walking away.


This episode was amazing, to put it simply. It showed how Ahsoka was forgiving of the clones and how she hated to fight them. I had goosebumps all through the second half. The way that the show ends in the clone helmet shot was just so incredibly well done. Dave Filoni has proved time and time again to be an amazing writer and director. He needs to be making Star Wars movies.

Also the saddest shot in the episode was the clones being ordered to fire on the droids helping Ahsoka and Rex escape.",Episode 12: Victory and Death -My Take
StarWars,"The clone wars is almost over and I would just like to say thank you to Dave Filoni, Matt Lanter, James Arnold Taylor, Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, Ian Abercrombie, Sam Witwer, Corey Burton, Catherine Tabwr, Tom Kane, Matthew Wood, Jim Cummings, Jon Favreau and everyone who made the clone wars what it is and for making our childhoods great by introducing and perfecting these amazing characters and quite honestly, saving the entire prequel trilogy

Thank you and the best of luck for all your future projects",Victory and Death
StarWars,"Yes, it seems like I’m jumping on the “sequel suck bandwagon” cause I am.

The first 6 movies + clone wars and rebels make a perfect story arch for Star Wars as a whole. And it has a happy ending. We watch the as Anakin turns into Vader, and back to Anakin again.  The rise and fall of the empire. Everything is perfect (from an overarching story perspective) 

The first 6 movies were Anakin’s story. They were about a republic that became the evil empire they were about a civil war for freedom. The fall of the Jedi knights. At the end of the saga we had some amazing characters and a great story. The Jedi, republic, and Anakin all had happy endings.

THEN THE SEQUEL TRILOGY comes along and says, “nah Luke failed to make new Jedi.” Destroys the republic which makes the OG trilogy useless, and then kills off characters we loved for a useless conflict. The ending was perfect and the sequel trilogy feels like a addition to just make money. 

Thoughts?",After watching clone wars’ finale I dislike the sequel trilogy even more.

StarWars,"In a recent episode of The Clone Wars, Maul explains that he played his part and was then cast away. What exactly was his part? Duel two random Jedi on Naboo and get cut in half? No. Here I will explain his part and why his master Palpatine is a genius. 

Palpatine was friends with the Jedi council long before he became supreme chancellor, that and the Trade Federation blockading his homeworld allowed him special knowledge of which Jedi knights would be partaking in the negotiations to remove said blockade. Dooku, who had trained Qui Gon Jinn had already left the Order at this point and was falling to the dark side. Dooku was a brilliant strategist and swordsman, an ally Palpatine would need in the coming Clone War, and so to ensure that when he did fall to the dark side he had Maul kill Qui Gon Jinn so that the apprentice would be unable to appeal to his former master’s remaining light. What happened to Maul after was of no importance to Palpatine since he was then going to recruit Dooku.

A side effect of this assassination of Qui Gon was that his apprentice, Obi Wan Kenobi, would be traumatized by the loss of his master, and given that Qui Gon had determined to train Anakin, Obi Wan would carry on his legacy and train the boy. This traumatized Obi Wan would then play a pivotal role in Palpatine’s scheme. He would surely teach his expert knowledge of the Force, which of course Palpatine desired, but also pass on the poor emotional coping skills that were part of the flaws of the Jedi. This led to Anakin’s emotional immaturity and shortcomings that would lead to his eventual downfall to the dark side. By becoming a mentor to Anakin, he would be able to monitor his eventual apprentice’s emotional state to determine when it was time to trigger his fall to the dark side, and when he did, Dooku was cast aside. 

Ahsoka was a liability to Palpatine’s plan. The bond between master and apprentice would likely have been strong enough to return Anakin to the light, which is why I believe Rex was the first clone commander given Order 66.

And that is why Palpatine was a long game playing genious.",Palpatine is a genius

StarWars,"Watching all the films and TV series, one could say that Sidious abandoning Maul for dead in TPM set off a chain of events which led to his undoing in TROS:  


1. If Sidious had not abandoned Maul on Naboo, Maul would not have become a crime boss.
2. Without Maul to lead them, Crimson Dawn would never have come into existence.
3. Without Crimson Dawn, Han Solo would not have met Lando Calrissian.
4. If Han and Lando had never met, the former would never have won the Millennium Falcon.
5. Without the Falcon, Han and Chewie would never have met Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Skywalkers.
6. Without Han, Luke would never have had the opportunity to destroy the Death Star, Vader would have unwittingly killed his son, and at least one of the Skywalkers would have perished at the Battle of Yavin.
7. Without the destruction of the first Death Star, Sidious would not have been motivated to use himself as bait during the Battle of Endor. 
8. Without all the Skywalkers surviving the Battle of Yavin, the son would never have turned his father back to the light.
9. If Anakin had never turned back to the light, he would never have killed Sidious as the Chosen One.
10. If Sidious had not been killed at the Battle of Endor, he would not have created Snoke as a puppet to turn Ben Solo to the Dark Side.
11. If Ben Solo had never turned to the Dark Side, Rey would not have awakened to the Force in the way she did.
12. If Rey had not discovered the Force on Starkiller Base, the Force Dyad between her and Ben would not have become a reality.
13. Without Rey and Ben working together, Sidious' plans for Rey to succeed him would not have been foiled.
14. Referring back to item #3, if Han and Lando had never met, Lando would not have become an ally of the Rebellion.
15. If Lando had never become an ally of the Rebellion, he would not have destroyed the second Death Star, and he would not have been present to rally the entire galaxy to the Battle of Exegol!

In the final analysis, Sidious' failure to rescue a defeated Maul on Naboo was one of his greatest mistakes. Since he was able to retrieve a mutilated Vader from Mustafar years later, there was no reason why he could not have done the same for his first apprentice.",Abandoning Maul in TPM: Sidious's fatal oversight
StarWars,"- Non Spoiler Post -

I want to thank Dave, &amp; Lucasfilm for making a great series and letting us see how this series closed out. From Geonosis to Order 66, The Clone Wars is and always will be one of the Greatest stories ever told in The Star Wars franchise. I remember when previews came out for the animated movie back in 2007-08, then the movie all the way to the series. The Clone Wars will have some the greatest memories in my childhood all the way till now. My one wish is that we could see more Clone Commando action, but the whole entire series delivered amazing battles, story arcs, and introduced new characters. Clone Wars forever !",Clone Wars
StarWars,"I just need to express how amazing I think this episode looked. Growing up I enjoyed watching the live action movies, but this last episode hit different. Don't get me wrong  the story was great, and Ahsoka and Rex are awesome. The visuals however just felt perfect. It didn't really click until this last episode for me. Ahoska falling through space looked great, especially the lighting and textures. And then on the ground with Rex, Ahsoka, and Vader. From the burn marks on the helmets, to Ahsoka's entire character model and the way her robe was flowing. And finally the imperial ship and Vader. His movement was incredibly smooth and the snow made everything just look that much better. Whether it's more Clone Wars or a different show, I think Disney should continue this style and quality of animation. Interested to hear your thoughts on it, do you think there is any animation style superior to this?",This episode (12) looked better than any other TV of Movie I have ever seen and it is the way I think Star Wars should be produced.
StarWars,"So, we know Jedi are pretty heavily inspired by Samurai given their sense of honorable or atleast mythic warriors, whose main skill lies in the usage of swords, who act as guardians for the people at large and adhere to a very strict code of conduct.

Sure the comparison isn't perfect but they do act and fight like how one would expect a modern samurai to...atleast in a Sci-fi capacity.

That got me wondering if the Mandalorian's one of the few groups or orders of people held in a similar high regard to the Jedi would be the Ninja Equivalent. They certainly fight more like Ninjas since they rely more heavily on various weapons, tricks and deception in battle rather than relying more on swords like the Jedi do. Also the fact most of their weapons and culture was developed to combat the Jedi much like how Ninjas themselves were originally ordinary people who developed skills and weapons specifically to counter the Samurai. 

Sure the comparison isn't perfect like I said, but I do feel like there is atleast some argument to be made.",Are Mandalorian's the Star Wars equivalent of Ninjas?
StarWars,"May the fourth be with you all! Happy Stars Wars day.

So, I've never seen the entirity of the Star Wars franchise. My parents are fans of the film and my sister has seen Star Wars too. While I've never watched the movies growing up, my childhood has consisted of seeing Star Wars posters, playing with Star Wars toys and owning the DVD's. The only films I've seen entirely are 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Rise of Skywalker' (please don't grill me) due to my parents wanting to drag me to the cinemas to see them. I must say I really enjoyed 'The Rise of Skywalker' more than 'The Force Awakens'. Other than that, I have seen video clips of the movies online and know the general storyline and plot of the movies. And I obviously know Darth Vader is Luke's father.

So I've been thinking to myself on whether I should watch the rest of the films. When my parents get the 'Rise of Skywalker' DVD they have this idea of doing a Star Wars trilogy binge before Christmas. I'm considering joining them so I can see all the movies for the first time.

What do you think? Should I watch them?",I've never seen the entire franchise. Should I? (May the fourth be with you!)

Is there anything that fills in the timeline between ROTJ and TFA? Anything that fills in Han and Leia's life together? Sorry if this has already been asked, or seems basic. I've tried to do some research but there's tons of books and only some are canon now? Anyway, thanks in advance for any direction!",Book recommendations?

After he failed to capture her he tried to find information regarding her last known recorded location. Why else would he be on that planet?,Where is Vader at the of episode &amp; how many years after the clone wars?

StarWars,"Despite the Ahsoka novel no longer being canon (I think it's the first disney star wars content to not be considered canon), I still recommend the book and just wanted to give some thoughts between the novel and the new clone wars episodes.

I'd like to start by saying that the new clone wars episodes are AMAZING and I'm very happy with how the show handled the Siege of Mandalore arc. I'd like to establish that I have no qualms with the Siege of Mandalore arc and am even happy that such a good arc is able to replace the Ahsoka novel in canon.

That is to say, I still recommend reading the novel (or listening to the audiobook). Even if it's no longer canon, or at least most of it no longer is, it's a wonderful read.

There are some parts I like more in the novel than in the new arc, such as Ahsoka's banter with maul about being half a sith, the parts after order 6y regarding how Ahsoka got her new lightsabers etc. But overall I do believe the new clone wars episodes are better and am happy that it's the new canon.

To get to the point, reading the novel does not take anything out of the experience even though it's not canon.

Tldr, I still recommend reading the Ahsoka novel even though it's not canon.",Recommending to read Ahsoka novel even if it's no longer canon

StarWars,"I love Star Wars so god damn much it's impossible to put it into words. I grew up with the prequels and originals and have always loved these movies.

I rewatched Episode 3 yesterday and god the ending just breaks my heart. I startes watching Clone Wars recently and I already love every single clones, they're humanized so well and it's so easy to care about them. Same with all the others, I love Anakin and Obi-wan even more thanks to TCW.

A lot of the time I wish I lived in Star Wars, I mean what a universe it would be to live in. Imagine being a Jedi! Seeing all these cool places, meeting so many great characters. Sometimes I want this so badly, just to get out of the real world, it hurts. The closest I can get to that is listening to the music or playing the games. 

I just love it so damn much, I'm sure so many people can relate. I sadly can't say I enjoyed the sequels, but I've got so much more that I can and do enjoy, and I'm so grateful for that. Not all the movies are perfect, everything has some flaws, but I still love them dearly.

Thank you George Lucas for creating this, thank you to all the people who've worked on Star Wars and thank you to the community who keeps on supporting it and keeping it alive. I think I might be feeling extremely nostalgic rn, but I do love this franchise very much. It's been a big part of my life, and I'm very grateful for it. 

May the Force be with you all, always!",Happy Star Wars Day (+ appreciation post)
StarWars,"Much in the same vein as DC's animated films. They could try out different animation styles for different projects. They could adapt different forms of Star Wars media such as comics and novels. Making an animated movie is nowhere near as expensive as a live-action movie is, and it's not as big a commitment as a TV show is. They'd also be the perfect testing ground for new characters, or even old characters they want to put into their big movies. Disney+ is already the perfect place to put these movies but I'd still want Blu Ray's made. I've recently been reading the Thrawn trilogy so I'd love to see them adapted.",Disney should make animated Star Wars movies
StarWars,You know what’s hilarious is that Rian Johnson’s trilogy would make soo much money because people hate him soo much they’d pay to see his movies just to write and record 3 hour hate videos on YouTube lol. Knives out also made a ton for its budget 160 for a 40 mil budget and Star wars 9 made 300 mil less he didn't hurt the brand it'd still make cash regardless just like Lucas which they swore he ruined their childhood and made a documentary hating on George. people hated the prequels and people still payed to see them.,Rian Johnson's Star Wars trilogy would still be successful
StarWars,"I know it's been a while but I just hadn't been able to watch it before...

I'll be honest, up until TFA dropped I hadn't watched any of the movies, so I didn't grow up with all the fuzz about the movies, and I do believe that affects the way I get the movies.

So... First, I believe this trilogy is built on nostalgia, in bringing old characters back and tell a story that is only written to allow the oldies shine.

Second... What the hell was that kiss? 

Third... Palpatine talks about a powerful bond not seen for centuries, why didn't we get this explained? on TLJ we could've had an explanation about how Ben and Rey were connected and also we could've known she was a Palpatine descendent (I truly feel that they ran out of ideas with this Palpatine heritage thing and that that is why it appeared just on Rise)

Fourth... What was the point of Rose during the second movie if she was going to be on stand by all the third one?

Fifth... Poe is my favorite character.

Please tell em what you think!",So I just watched the last movie and I have questions
StarWars,"Many seem to be very upset with the sequels for apparently ruining Anakin's Legacy and muting the prophecy he allegedly fulfilled when he defeated Palpatine. But, as to the release of Season 7, I've begun to watch The Clone Wars all the way through.

You may know where I'm headed with this. I just finished ""Overlords"" Episode 15 of season 3, where pretty much the Gods of the Force, or at least, the closest thing to it, asked him to remain on the planet and maintain the balance between two avatars of the force, representative of The Light and The Dark.

He refused. 

To that end, is it not true that Anakin failed? Was this not the moment that he was supposed to fulfill his destiny? I mean, a prophecy is a prediction, isn't it? Not necessarily a concrete description of the future.

To me, it seems Anakin's chance to do his job was missed. The avatar of the dark killed that of the light and subsequently, the entirety of the Jedi order was murdered.

""The balance has been broken""

Perhaps ""balance"" was killing all three avatars and leaving humanity to decide their own fates?",Regarding the Prophecy
StarWars,"Note: The reason TCW S7 got polished is because the fans + Filoni rallied for many years, and finally we achieved our goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr Dave Filoni, here is an idea a large chunk has been proposing for many years (and I am certain it has probably crossed your mind aswell), please push to make this happen:

&amp;#x200B;

tldr at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

**Synopsis:**

A new animated Star Wars series set after Revenge of the Sith and set many many years before Rebels, I am talking about 1 or 2 years post ROTS here.

The story will be about Vader and the rise of the Empire during the prime years of the empire, executing the Jedi purge with troopers (Transition from Clone to Normies) and some senate stuff.

*Title suggestion's:*

* *Vader*
* *Rise of the Empire*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Animation style:**

The animation style will be that inbetween TCW (Prequel Vibe) and SWR (Sequel Vibe).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:**

I understand that making a series of full 20 min episodes featuring Vader could be taxing on his presence, one thing I have noticed is that Vader is only present in the franchise for ""necessary"" moments; this keeps him as the mysterious dark figure we all grew up to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution:**  
Make the episodes as small shorts, perhaps 5 - 10 minute episodes each -&gt; Totaling the length to 60 - 90 minutes. This way there is no need to saturate Vader's character and appearance -&gt; Instead it can be shown as another Star Wars story, on par with the quality of a movie.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Pro's:**

* We get to see a visual depiction of the Great Jedi Purge.
* We see the Republic's transition into the Empire (Senate + Military).
* Commander Cody training Imperial Recruits.
* Possible Kaminoan Rebellion Arc.
* We see more Order 66 + the after effects of Order 66.
* Animating the series rather than live action will allow a lot more flexibility when creating.
* Happy Star Wars fan's.
* Happy Disney with all the money they are making with Happy Star Wars fan's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Con's:**

* It may take a bit of convincing to get Disney to agree to this.
* We may have to wait 2-3 years for this to become a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know other people's opinions on this idea.

**TL;DR:** A proposal for a new Star Wars animated series set after Revenge of the Sith focused on the Jedi purge and the Imperial Senate.","Dave Filoni - I know you want this as much as the fans, please make this Animated series:"
StarWars,"Just a thought I’ve had:

The final arc of TCW season 7 was obviously designed as a 2-hour film to be released in 4 parts. You could literally merge the episodes together and title it “Star Wars: The Seige of Mandalore”. 

Disney has been pretty clear that this is the final season of TCW. However, I think it’s very possible they will produce a few feature films covering some of the arcs we never got to see - stuff like Crystal Crisis, Ventress &amp; Quinlan Voss, Battle of Mygeto, etc. 

Disney+ could easily produce a 2 hour Clone Wars special annually for a few years. Maybe I’m just being hopeful...",More animated Clone Wars movies theory
StarWars,"In honor of May the 4th be with you I’m sharing a fun post about my favorites in Star Wars. You all should share your  favorites also!

1. Favorite non-force user: Captain (Commander) Rex. Rex has been my favorite for a while, since the show began in 2008. Wonderful character growth and built Anakin and Ashoka as characters.

2. Favorite force user: Luke Skywalker. Luke has been my favorite since I was a kid. I always hoped to be as cool and determined and caring as Luke was. 

3. First movie seen in theaters: Attack of the Clones. I was 6 when I saw this and it blew my mind seeing all of the Jedi on screen. Still one of my favorites. 

4. Favorite movie: Return of the Jedi. Hands down my favorite. Completes Vader’s redemption, Luke is a great leader and Jedi. Possibly best in the saga.

5. Favorite show: The clone wars. Adds so much to the lore and builds on characters we only saw glimpses of.

6. Favorite quote: Yoda to Luke in Ep. VII. Yoda tells Luke to pass on what he has learned. 
“Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also, yes failure most of all. The greatest teacher failure is.” This quote resonates with me because I’ve had a few mistakes in my life but I’ve learned from them and it reminds me that we use these mistakes to grow and help others in to be better.

Happy #maythe4thbewithyou 

And thank you to @hamillhimself @iamraypark @instadaniellogan @ashleyeckstein @jatactor and so many others for bringing these characters to life and being such a fun and important part of so many lives.",My favorites
StarWars,"After seeing Maul's entire journey in the series and how he was saved from being a simple sith with a cool lightsaber to a complex character with a grey morality that everyone loves I wish that Dooku had had the same love in his development. In Clone Wars he barely has any changes in his personality and, in fact, we hardly see any ambiguity in his actions. We as fans know that he hates the corruption of the Jedi and the Republic, and how, using the Separatists and Palpatine, he wants to inflict a necessary change to the Galaxy. His political ideology, his subtlety, is something that is lost in the series in my opinion. And since Dooku is my favorite character it hurts a little how it has been treated over time.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Am I a fool for wanting more for an interesting character, or is general consensus that Dooku wasn't that interesting and he fulfilled his role as a character?","Honestly, I wish Dooku could have gotten the same development as Maul."
StarWars,"Just been thinking the past few days and with seeing the end of Clone Wars ( no spoilers at all) just now, i'm feeling a bit nostalgic.

What is the epitome of Star Wars to you? 

For me it's always been Obi Wan and Anakin.  Those two going on their adventures in the prequels, Clone Wars series, even the video games like Lego Star Wars and the movie adaptions for PS2. Thats what I think of when I think of Star Wars. Thats who I emulated when acting out scenes with toy lightsabers as a kid.

I'm not sure anything in Star Wars is going to capture that feeling for me like seeing those two together did and it's got me a bit sad that with clone wars done for good I'll probably never see them two together again. That is unless theres some flashback shenanigans in the Obi Wan show if thats still happening.","What is ""peak Star Wars"" to you?"
StarWars,"I'm beginning my Star Wars Day celebrations in the morning where I'm gonna make my way through all 12 movies. 

Except this year instead of doing it all in one sitting I'm wanting to go ALL OUT because I'm not sure if I'll get this chance again.

So I'm planning to add in both the clone wars and Rebels into the mix, which is gonna take a few days as it is so to help counteract it a little I'm planning on condensing it down to what I think needs to be watched for: Self Contained plot, Overall impact, Sheer awesome factor... Basically only the important bits like the return of maul and the good bits like the Citadel arc.

This is the list I've concocted so far.


-Malevolence Arc (S1 It was the only good arc from the first season 

-Clone Cadets(S3) good episode and contextualised Domino squad

-Rookies (S1) see above

-Arc Troopers (S3)see above

-Ryloth Liberation Arc (S1) the only other good arc

-Brain Invaders Arc (S2) explores the relationship between in Ahsoka and Barriss

-Mandalore Voyage Arc (S2) Mandalore plot

-Cat &amp; Mouse (S2) fun episode that tied to the movie

-Boba Arc (S2) non essential but I feel it was needed for Boba Plus it gave a little more context for his later appearances

-Nightsister Arc (S3) begins the Maul arc, plus it also contextualised a lot of the NS and Dathormir appearances

-The Mortis Arc (S3) I kinda feel this is self explanatory

-Citadel Arc (S3) it's my favourite arc in the entire series, if you don't feel the same you don't have to... But you might be confused when Echo suddenly isn't there anymore

-Chancellor Assassination arc (S4) my Third favourite arc you don't need to

-Dathormirs fall and the return of maul arc (S4/5) more maul which is the recurring them for this season

-Fall of Mandalore and Ahsoka leaves arc (S5) grouped these together because they're back to back but it's all basically set up for the Siege of Mandalore (also 2 Amazing stories in their own right) This is also why point rain is in the list


-Conspiracy Arc (S6) Amazing emotional arc and sets up Order 66

-The Lost Ones (S6) The Tie In to Sifo Dias was really cool, and the order 66 part was the reason I put it here

-Force Ghost Arc (S6) or Yoda's arc, this is hear for the same reason Mortis is

-Bad Batch Arc (S6) it's a great Arc over all

A Thing to note is that the Siege of Mandalore is here but I would be watching it after Revenge of the sith.

I'd like some constructive criticism here of what people think in general, if things should be put in or taken out etc. And also I'm wanting to build a list for rebels  so if people could help with Taht I'd be really appreciative.",I've come up with a list of Arcs and Episodes for the clone wars down to the important bits and wanted people's opinions.

Leave your opinion in the comments.",My top ten of the entire Clone Wars series.
StarWars,"I really don’t understand why people are excited for the new series because they haven’t created a series on a character that fans love like Ahsoka, Darth Revan or even a series or trilogy on the old canon story after Ep. 6(Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo and Anakin solo.) Instead they have chosen to give, in all honesty a minor character, from a spin-off film his own series. And while I get that K-2SO and Cassian were popular it’s annoying as they could do a similar type of show but for Ahsoka when she went by Fulcrum, and she is a character that almost everyone loves and has been a major part of the Star Wars universe.

Also, a different annoying thing I have about Star Wars Disney, I am so frustrated by the fact that in the sequel trilogy and spin-offs there has been hardly any new, exciting ships designs, which bugs me as a big fan of space battles. I mean the most unique, and good, design of the Disney era is the the U-wing which I actually really like, but when you look at the Sequel trilogy there is honestly nothing new. I mean out of all three films pretty much the only new ship in either the FO’s or Resistance’s fleet is the SF-17 bomber which is terrible(I’ll talk about it later.) 

It just annoys me to help though thinking about how much better the prequels were, apart from the dialogue, just because they introduced interesting planets, cool ships, for the most part good characters, new species and most importantly actually seemed innovative. Whilst the Sequel trilogy literally rips off the OT.

So, I’m going to talk about the SF-17 bomber now, even though it’s been two years since TLJ. I’m literally going to just make a comparison between the Y-Wing and the SF-17. For one thing the SF-17 was a newly built ship yet it moves 100x slower than the Y-Wing which was made 50 years ago and still works at that time. Another thing, the SF-17 has a crew of 5 people, and can still be easily destroyed, meanwhile the Y-Wing can fly with just one pilot and an Astromech for Navigation/Rear gunner. 

It’s all of those comparisons that make me think has anyone whose part of the Sequel trilogy ever actually seen Star Wars.

I know that lots of other people share this opinion but seriously, we need to just boycott Disney given how much they are ruining an amazing universe, and to the  people that like the new films and like what Disney have done is just show them that Disney are trying to change the dating system from BBY/ABY to BSI/ASI. Which is so retarded as that would put Ep. 1 at 62 BSI whilst Ep.7 and Ep. 8 would be 0 BSI and 0 ASI. And the final film, Ep. 9 would be at 1 ASI, but with the Battle of Yavin used as the dating system you would have Ep. 1 at 32 BBY and Ep. 9 at 31 ABY, which I think everyone can agree is the hugely better system",Am I the only one who isn’t excited for the Cassian Andor series?
StarWars,"After seeing The Rise of Skywalker in theaters my wife and I decided to do a whole watch through of all the Star Wars movies and shows, starting with The Phantom Menace. She had never seen all of The Clone Wars or Rebels before. We were able to finish season 6 of Clone Wars right before season 7 started. 

After about a month of only one episode a week, we got impatient and decided to start Rebels while also keeping up with the new episodes of Clone Wars (which was an awesome decision).

Earlier this week I realized we had the chance to watch A New Hope on May the 4th if we sped up our viewing. After 25 episodes in 5 days and watching Rogue One tonight, we will be celebrating May the 4th by watching the series finale of Clone Wars and A New Hope.

I hope you all have fun celebrating watching, reading, or playing your favorite Star Wars stories. 

May the Force be with you.","Tomorrow I will be celebrating May the 4th by watching the newest piece off Star Wars media, followed immediately by the oldest."
StarWars,"What did you feel when you first saw the trailer to ""The Force Awakens""? Hope?

What after you saw the movie? Nostalgia? Disappointment?

How about the Trailer to ""The Last Jedi""? Hope again?

And the movie? Surprisement? Excitement? Disappointment again?

Now comes ""The Rise of Skywalker"" Trailer. Still hope?

I hoped till the last second of the movie. Maybe it was naive or the longing for sense. That in the end they would come up with an explanation to all those plotholes and unbelievably convenient coincidences.

The movies of the latest trilogy can be criticised on many levels. They also did things right and showed us amazing moments! But those only linger. Thus they don't remove a feeling they shockingly created. A feeling that is far worse than any technical critique: The feeling of not caring anymore.

I was a Star Wars Fan. Since i was a kid and my older brother showed me the old trilogy in secret because our parents wouldn't let me at my age back then. We always had that connection and talked about the movies, books, games and the overall lore. But not anymore. Because we don't care anymore.

Yes i watched all of the new trilogy at first chance in cinema. But i never thought i would walk out of a Star Wars Movie thinking about it like Transformers: ""at least the effects were amazing"".

I want the STORY to be amazing! In the old trilogy our beloved characters developed while they undertook an epic journey at which they had to tackle challenges, suffer losses and make sacrifices to achieve something of importance.

SPOILER WARNING FOR IX!

Nowadays all it takes is an uninspired version of a former frightening villain who melts himself with his own lightning blast because he didn't force-foresee the power of an extra lightsaber wielded by his indestructible granddaughter who conveniently became ""all the jedi"" in the same timeframe in which the legendary Luke Skywalker couldn't even lift an X-Wing out of a swamp!

Yes, maybe the last part is exagerated and false. But as i said: i don't care. The writers didn't so why should i?

I once loved a universe full of believable characters, surprising storys and mystic adventures.
That is gone because of an advertisement for merchandise which is devoid of established logic.

TL;DR: If you feel anything like me then don't just use #maythefourthbewithyou to show love to a once fascinating universe. Add #maythestorybewithyou to remind Disney that all we want is a great story.


Please Disney:
Make me care again

StarWars,"Star Wars is eternal, but it doesn’t help the fact that with the final episode of the Clone Wars, the final piece of George Lucas Star Wars is coming to a close. Dave and the rest of the team have done beyond an incredible job of sending this era of Star Wars off with the biggest bang they could; we may never truly get ANYTHING prequel based again. Regardless, not hating on any kind of Star Wars, just been thinking of how I wish it could go on forever. Midnight will be hit hard tonight everyone. I’m glad we could all take this ride.",Nothing but bittersweet waiting for the final episode to drop.
StarWars,"There is a roughness in the sequel trilogies. Its hard to describe but it feels like an even more decentralized and scattered Galaxy. Idk if I make sense but for example the Knights of Ren and Kylo having an unstable light sabre with the hilt guard. The brute force aesthetic of the First Orders AtAts and Star Destroyers who in many ways feels weaker than the empires. The resistance being an even more outdated and weaker rebel alliance.

We went from Civilization in the prequels to the tyranny of the Empire and now its a devestated post world were the structures of power have been reformed into dust. Its a galactic dark age, not due to the first order but every side trying to exist as a weak mockery of what came before. 

It feels like Medieval europe to the Roman Republic and Empire and its end is the final start of an attempt to recreate. With Luke's death the last of the Old Jedi are gone. Eventually new dark siders will rise but hopefully also a new galaxy not trying to emulate the past but create something new.

Fyi I still wish Rey didn't adopt a last name, kiss Ben or just most of the sequel trilogy feeling like it made sense. But thinking of it like this kinda makes me appreciate it somewhat. I just wish they had been more bold with the saga. Made new designs etc.",The One thing I do like about the Sequel Trilogy.
StarWars,I've done some digging into this but all I could come up with was that he wanted other people to tell Star Wars stories. it seems odd he'd do this since he had three more movies plan. Did he just think Disney was going to make them then they screwed him over? If he did think that why didn't he make them guarantee it? Or why not hire someone else to make them or sell them to a company he had more control over? This is especially interesting because he seems like he's not a huge fan of the new movies and am wondering how he feels seeing the direction of new Star Wars stories.,Why did George Lucas sell Star Wars?

StarWars,"I just want to congratulate Dave Filoni and his team for creating this show. I only just began watching it when Disney + came out and I was hooked immediately. The characters were the true pull of this show for me and seeing them deal with real problems in real and deep ways made this stand out from the first episode. The final episode of this show is one of my favourite episodes of tv of all time. The cinematography is just incredible with some truly terrific shots of Ahsoka in her robe mirroring the end of rebels while also conveying so much raw emotion. The final shot of Vader reflected in the destroyed clone trooper helmet sums up the true purpose of the show and shows how Ahsoka and Anakins relationship grew and became more strong with time and ultimately the image  reflects the two characters we love in what they have become. The music is absolutely incredible in this show. Towards the end of the episode the music is some of the best and most fitting for a scene in Star Wars and carry‘s the raw emotion held in the scene. I love this show and this was a truly incredible way to end it. I don’t think I would have any problems calling characters like Ahsoka my favourite in all of Star Wars and would have no problem calling this some of my favourite Star Wars content out there.

Thank you to Dave Filoni and his team for creating this absolute masterpiece.",The end of the clone wars
StarWars,"
Now hear me out, some of you will argue that it’s the Original Trilogy because that set it all up, because Empire Strikes Back is the greatest of the movies and it has the best acting. True, the Original Trilogy is amazing, but the Clone Wars era is the best aspect of Star Wars and here’s why... 

When we begin, we are thrown into a galactic war between the Republic Government and the Separatist Alliance and the story mainly follows Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex. 

These Characters progress brilliantly from beginning to finish. When we begin, we see Anakin as brash but light and full of determination that nothing could stop him. At the end, we see him angered, lacking trust in his order and feeling abandoned by his friends. Obi Wan is wise and cunning, back went through so much during these 3 years. Maul’s resurgence, the death of Satine, having to survive the war and Order 66 and to face his brother. Rex at the beginning was heavy in spirit and committed to defeating the droid army and at the end he is conflicted on the point of it all, why did so many of his brothers have to die. 

And last, but not least, Ahsoka at the beginning is arrogant and lacking experience in life, but she progresses so beautifully as a Padawan and person, she makes mistakes, as everyone does, but leaned from them naturally and became skilled and strategic, but was betrayed by her order and left as a result, leaving Anakin feeling abandoned himself. The character development is the most definitive and excellent of all the Star Wars characters.

Also, in Clone Wars, it feels like an action war, in the Original and Sequel trilogies barely any characters who we connected to died. In war, there will always be casualties and that’s something a bit lacking in these trilogies. Whereas, in the prequels and Clone Wars, you have characters like Qui Gon Jinn, Hevy, Fives, 99, Gregor (at the time before Rebels), Satine and Savage. It presents an actual war spread through seven seasons.

I would like to thank George Lucas and Dave Filoni for their creative vision and determination in preserving this series and making it the best Star Wars series of all time. Thank you!",Why Clone Wars is the best aspect of Star Wars
StarWars,"My relationship with Disney and Lucas film is a mixed relationship, I like what they have done with the tv shows and Games. And the Star Wars stories movies (rouge one and Han Solo) however I dislike the the sequel trilogy, but when I heard about the renewal of the clone wars I was thrilled and exited of what might come. As well as anxious of the potential that Lucas-film and Disney could destroy my childhood show, but when the episodes where released I was pleasantly surprised and relieved that Dave Filoni and the team at Lucas film where able to re create the anxiety and betrayal we all felt in revenge of the sith. 

For that, I want to thank you. You have made my childhood memorable!

What is everyone’s favorite throwaway scene/line from the Star Wars saga? We all know the classic moments and lines, but what about those hidden gems that stand out to you?

Mine is from TPM: Near the end of the podracing scene, Sebulba throws a spare part over his shoulder and destroys the podracer of Mars Duo. Just before he crashes, he lets out a solid “Eraauuuuu!” Not sure why, but I always laugh at that moment and it’s long been an inside joke between friends.",Favorite throwaway scene/line?
StarWars,"I liked the episode. It was brilliant, but I just want to know if I am the only one who thinks there is missing something?

I personally think between the moment Rex and Ahsoka land on the moon and the Empire/Vader scene, there should have been at least 5 more minutes. Maybe narrated by Obi-Wan's message of the fall of the Republic and the jedi order. Then we would have seen Ahsoka and Rex going separate ways and Rex hinting that other clones could still be saved from the inhibitor chips and we could have also got to see a little of the galaxy during the montage. 

Additionally the moment Ahsoka leaves the grave morai (the bird from rebels which also flies above Vader in the finale) should have been seen watching her in the background.

And the clone helmet in the last shot of the episode should have been without any legion markings or with blue for the 501st.

StarWars,"It was the night before May the 4th. 

Not a Jedi was stirring, not even a Padawan;

The Lightsabres were hung, on the rack with care.

In a hopes that Anakin would soon be there.

The Younglings were nestling all in their beds.

While visions of being slaughtered came to their heads.

And the groundskeeper settled down for a nice long nap.

When out in the plaza there arose such a clatter.

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the window with  a wave of a hand.

The Moon on the stairs of the overarching Temple.

The silver Moon giving way to objects below. When what my wondering eyes did appear.

But an army of Clones, led by a hooded figure.

I knew in a moment he must be Skywalker. More rapid than Eagles his Clones did come.

As he pointed his Lightsabre and shouted their orders.
""Go forth!"" ""Go forth!"" ""They all must burn!""

To the top of the stairs! On the top of the wall!

Now run away! dash away, run away all!

As the dead bodies did fly.

When met with an obstacle, Sabre ignited.

So gunned him down the Clone troopers did.

With an army of Clones, and his Sabre ignited.

And then in a banging I heard on the walls.

As I drew my head, and was turning around.

Out through the door Skywalker did come.

Dressed in black from his head to his foot.

And his boots all tarnished with dust and debris.

A Lightsabre ignited he had in his hand.

And he looked like a monster just waiting to strike.

His eyes-How yellow they glowed in the dark.

His cheeks were pale, his face deadpan!

His mouth was shut, closed as the door.

The clench of a fist, he, narrowed his eyes.

And the dark, encircled his body like a cloak.

He had long hair, and had a metallic hand.

That whirred when he movied, like a rusty old clanker.

He was tall and lean, a menacing fellow.

And I cried when I saw him, fearing for my life.

A flourish of his Sabre, and a footstep forward. Soon gave to me know I had everything to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work.

And raised up his Sabre; and swiftly struck down.

And de-igniting his Sabre, attatching to his belt. Giving a nod, out the door he strode.

He returned to his Clones, and with a nod gave the order.

And away they all marched, down the halls in unison.

But Skywalker exclaimed, as he walked down the corridoors-

""It has been done my Lord""",May The 4th be with you all!!

Some of us haven't even seen TCW. I think the show serves the same purpose as the x-wing book series or the Thrawn trilogy did.

It sucks he never got to see the ending of the season. 

By time the post mortem and registration of his death was done, without realising it, I’d arranged for his cremation to occur on Star Wars day. I’d already picked that he’ll enter the crematorium to Binary Stars.  

It’s so very fitting for him as the giant Star Wars geek that he was and as sad as I am about losing him, I’m happy knowing that he’d have loved the fact today was the day of his cremation.

For the first part if the film, the queen of Naboo is played by a decoy, whilst the true queen adopts the role of handmaiden

My question is, to what extent does the decoy stay a decoy and not become the actual queen. This person calls herself the queen, acts as the queen and sends various messages/transmissions as the queen. The true queen however, spends the whole time serving, is ordered to clean a droid, AND DOES IT. 

To the extent this decoy is implemented, she may as well be the real queen. The reason the Trade Fed wanted to capture the queen was to sign a treaty. Were they planning in signing the treaty and then claiming its null and void because this person who did everything a queen does wasnt technically the queen?",Could someone explain the whole decoy queen element of TPM
StarWars,"It seems since the movie came out, I'm one of the only ones who actually REALLY enjoy TLJ. I really don't understand the hate for it other than maybe one or two things. I think it's one of not only the best Star Wars movies, but one of the best movies in general. It's beautiful, deep, unexpected, true to Star Wars and legacy characters while giving us something new and fresh.

This is my favorite Luke Skywalker movie. I think Hamil's performance is top-notch, and his character arc in this movie was perfect. He's a Skywalker, of course he's going to be dramatic by running away from everything. He saw what the legacy of the Jedi brought to the galaxy. It brought war and conflict while the Jedi were pretending to be peace keepers. After what happened to Kylo, I can understand Luke not wanting to be a part of any of it anymore. In his mind, he was making the better choice by staying out of everything. But the point of his arc was that he was wrong. The galaxy really did need a hero and a legend. He realizes that through Rey and Yoda, and he did one of the most Jedi and Luke Skywalker things ever by being a distraction to let the resistance escape and giving them hope while apologizing to Kylo and coming to terms that he will not be the last Jedi and there's still hope for them. That's so beautiful. God I can't describe how perfect that is.

The movie was BEAUTIFUL visually. Luke walking out to face the entire first order on Crait, oh my god. The tree burning scene with Luke and Yoda, the hyperspace through Snoke's ship, Ach-to, it's all so beautiful. 

I loved the force connection between Kylo and Rey. It was something new and it really built their connection. I loved Rey's want and need to be a part of something bigger, wanting to have important parents, but realizing through the force vision and Kylo that she DIDN'T need that. She could make her own destiny and shouldn't rely on others. Rey had a villains backstory while Kylo had a hero's backstory, yet they turned out opposite. That's art. 

There's so much more I can talk about like the entire Luke and Yoda scene, Luke training Rey, the music, Poe's arc, and yes even Finn and Rose's arc. I just wanted to share a few things on why I loved this movie. I would have to rank it #2 right behind ESB and right in front of RotS. 

What do you guys think about the movie? If you don't like it, tell me why. I would love to have a discussion about it.",Are there any other huge TLJ fans out there?
StarWars,"I just finished listening to ‘Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View’ audio book and I am in complete shock. For those who are unfamiliar, it is a collection of 40 short stories that was released for the 40th anniversary of A New Hope, and it’s absolutely amazingly well done. 

The stories are all told by and about characters that are either in A New Hope or very closely connected to, and all of the stories relate to famous scenes from the movie giving you an unexpected and refreshing new point of view on scenes we know and love. If you aren’t a fan of Star Wars books because they can feel a little too removed from the storyline we know and love in the movies, then I highly recommend giving this one a shot. 

The audiobook version is brilliantly done. They use just enough official soundbites of blasters, explosions, TIE fighters etc without over doing it. And the voice actors at times are SPOT ON, it’s a real joy to listen to. I was so surprised at how much it felt like an extension of A New Hope. It’s as if you’re watching the same movie we’ve loved for so many years and all the sudden the camera turns 180° and starts following a different character in the scene. Grab yourself a glass of blue milk and settle in tomorrow and give it a listen or a read. 

The nostalgia is so strong with this one. Trust me.",If you’re looking for some seriously unexpected nostalgia tomorrow and want something new on May the Fourth...I highly recommend the book ‘Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View’
StarWars,"

 the Sith bend the code or ""make the code work for them"", by that I mean that they will do things and try to excuse themselves in the code, being selfish, power hungry and basically just pushing their own agenda; after all, most Sith don't even care about the Empire and it becomes rather obvious if you play a full dark side sith.

Lana on the other hand believes in the Freedom part, power allows you to make your own options and, of course choose the fate of your lesser; although it's hard to know if she truly cares about her people or if she only sees them as tools. So in the end, she is the only ""true"" sith, since most reach their freedom by seeking power but don't realize that their own greed for more power enslaves them. Lana know her limits, she knows what must be done, she knows that the search for power never ends, so she seeks power in others where she can use to help and save the Empire and, subsequently, The Galaxy.",Lana beniko is the one true sith Lord
StarWars,"We see the Separatist killing civilians, torturing prisoners, etc. Therefore as kids, we all thought that the Separatists are evil. However, there is no reason at all for the Separatists to obey any martial law as the Jedi break martial law all the time too. In the case that there was no martial law in star wars the argument would have to change a bit: There is no reason at all for the Separatists to follow any ethical standards as the Jedi break them all the time. 

My line of argument will be based on the geneva conventions.

The first war crime in the clone wars series is perfidy, also known as false surrender.

* In the battle of Christophisis Obi-Wan pretends to surrender to buy time for Anakin to win the fight
* In the Battle of Ryloth Anakin claims to give himself up if the Republic was allowed to bring humanitarian aid to Ryloth. Instead, he flies a cruiser into the Separatist command ship
* In season 7 Anakin fakes surrender kill the commander of the local separatist forces

The Jedi torture prisoners of war

* Anakin force chokes a prisoner from Geonosis
* Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, and Anakin torture Cad Bane

The Jedi use child soldiers

* Underage padawans like Asokah act as commanders of the republican army

The Jedi kill/ try to kill enemies who surrender

* Mace Windu tries to kill Palpatine
* Anakin kills Count Doku

The Jedi force soldiers from the enemy side to fight for them

* To infiltrate the citadel Droids are reprogramed",The Jedi are just as evil as the Separatists

To me the Republic appeared to not give a flying fuck about things like suffering of sentient life so did they think the Republic would just like execute the clones ore just cut them loose to room the galaxy causing trouble.

StarWars,"This is just my thoughts on the matter. I’ve been thinking a bit on why people disliked the sequels. Personally, I thought they were good as individual films, but don’t produce a concrete trilogy and don’t mesh well with the previous films. I decided, just for fun, to try to come up with my own sequel trilogy. When I did this, I realized that the task was nearly impossible. Let me explain.

I am of the opinion that if you are going to continue a story, in either sequels or prequels, what you add needs to enhance the original story and feel like it’s not really separate from the original conflict. Let’s take the prequels as an example. What did they add to the original story? Well, they added more character depth to Kenobi and Vader and they gave us an idea of who the Jedi and Republic were. This meant that we gave more of a shit with the original trilogy. They also expanded the story to include Anakin being prophesied to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force, which he ultimately does in Return of the Jedi. Again, it enhances and adds to the original story. I say this as someone who generally dislikes the prequels as films, but likes them on the basis that they did add to the story. So what was the story about when the prequels were added? It was about Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who was destined to bring balance to the force, turning to the dark side due to Darth Sidious, who desired to bring the sith back and throw the force out of balance, and then being redeemed through his son, Luke Skywalker, and then destroying the sith and bringing balance. At the end of return of the Jedi, the sith were destroyed, the empire was on the run, and it can be assumed that a New Republic is going to be built and the Jedi will be restored. The story was ultimately about bringing balance to the force. Now comes the question. What can be added to the same story?

Well, nothing. The conflict was resolved. If you throw the force out of balance again, or bring back the sith, then you have undermined the point of the original story. And if you use new villains, then it’s not really the same story anymore. It may involve the same characters, but it’s not really tied with what came before. You can tell stories set after Return of the Jedi, but they won’t be apart of the same story the first six films were telling, and you might risk contradicting the original story. Return of the Jedi brought a proper end to the story that neither needed, nor could have a continuation. This is why no matter what they did the Sequels would always be problematic.",Star Wars should not have had a sequel trilogy at all.
StarWars,"So I have a question, because at the end of this new trilogy there is only 3 force users left who arent spirits, there is rey, finn and that sweeper boy. So lets assume for a moment the force continues on through bloodlines and doesnt end with those 3, what exactly is there to prevent a jedi from going dark and doing this force war all over again? Cause jedi arent machines that come out on an assembly line with no emotion, no thoughts of their own, all it takes is one dark jedi and this starts all over again",[spoilers] A question about the sith in the future
StarWars,"Why wasn’t Luke and ex machine the whole time? Well it’s simply bc Disney didn’t want him to steal the new characters thunder. ( in other words they wanted to sell merchandise more then tell a story) 

Dave Filoni, John favreau and Kevin Feige understand this more the Kennedy ever could, if there is only one reason for the hiatus between films it is to work out this problem at the top. I’m sure when new movies come out Kennedy will not be part of it. THANK GOD! 

Here’s to 2 trilogies and 3-4 spinoffs over the next 10-15 years with animated and live action shows tying it all together the way clone wars and rebels did such a great job at. 

While we all want an original story some sort of reboot is necessary to compete with the first 6 movies. 

So we need the Jedi to come into power once again and then face a menacing threat that actually wins in the first trilogy and then the 2nd is about removing that threat...then maybe we can get a third trilogy that actually takes us somewhere amazing. And actually tells an original story about victory over everything. W o rehashing old storylines and bringing back the deceased",Sequel trilogy sucked bc it was not producer driven. The first 6 films produced by Lucas had different directors for ESB and ROTJ. A set script was followed. KATHLEEN KENNEDY unfortunately didn’t do much producing by letting Rian Johnson take full control. She singlehandedly ruined ROS.

StarWars,"This is a galaxy with a population well into the trillions, if not much higher.  The separatists can produce many times the number of clones they said in the movie.  The 1.6 million number we get in attack of the clones just makes no sense, especially considering they were produced to combat battle droids, which can be produced at a much much faster rate.  I mean, 1.6 million clones really shouldn’t even be enough to take one very well fortified planet.  Think about it this way: 1.6 million men wasn’t enough people to invade WWII era Germany, yet the republic was regularly taking and then defending planets.  It just seems to me that there should be more like billions of clones than the, comparatively speaking, very small figure we get in AOTC",It always bothered me that there are so few clones.

StarWars,"The second episode of the new trilogy, revolves around a rebellion space ship who is escaping from the first order, ignoring the stupidity of the people involved and how bad the film was, especially considering fuel was never an issue in no star wars film before this, according to newton's first law, since in space there is no air, and in that moment: no gravitational pull or any other forces influencing the trajectory and speed of the spaceship, couldn't they just go full speed for a second and then turn off the engines? They wouldn't be wasting fuel and would still be moving at top speed. If this right, is Mickey Mouse just a bigger idiot than I thought or just an idiot alongside me?","Question about space and ""Fuel"" in star wars."
StarWars,"So I've been thinking about this while trying to not be as frustrated with The Sequels as much as I am:

What if Palpatine being a clone in The Rise of Skywalker was a contingency plan like Operation: Cinder from Battlefront II. But he was a failed clone that the real Emperor Palpatine passed his consciousness into shortly after Vader killed him in Return of the Jedi. 

  
Being a failed clone, meaning this is technically a new character holding the mantle of Emperor Palpatine. This explains why hes a complete idiot when it comes to planning, but is still Sheev enough to be recognized by Luke and the OT gang (and apparently the resistance too).

  
This wouldn't change the fact that the Sequels are a bad trilogy overall, but it can somewhat undo the damage the Sequels did to the Original 6 Movie Skywalker Saga. This way, Anakin is still the Chosen one and he did bring balance to the force.

Idk, it seems like a better explanation than that the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.",Penny for your thoughts...

Basically overpower the opponents with sheer strength and hope they can't hold up as that is all that is really needed

I mean as far as Vader is aware the Jedi Order is dead, there are no combatants alive that could match up to him. Even blaster wielding foes are no problem to a Jedi/Sith","When engaged in lightsaber combat, did Vader have any tactics other than brute strength?"
StarWars,"I honestly hate that they make the clones turn into “zombies” who are brainwashed because of the inhibitor chip and kill the Jedi because they can’t help it. It takes out the human in them and makes them seem like droids that are programmed for a single task. Clones were originally just soldiers who followed orders because their allegiance to the republic topped any allegiance to anyone else. Old canon didn’t have an inhibitor and they simply followed orders. 

Order 66 is a regular order that anyone can look up including the Jedi. The order basically allows troops to terminate any Jedi who is a traitor, which is the same order that allowed dogma to kill prong Krell. 

Also, if you don’t consider the inhibitor chip, clones are soldiers who are primarily loyal to the republic and chancellor, and that beats any loyalty to the Jedi. I’d like to believe that they had no chip and followed orders simply because at the end of the day that’s where they’re allegiance lies. 

If anyone played the original battlefront 2, you would know that the clones were torn apart from the order but chose to follow because they are soldiers and didn’t need a chip to follow orders. By giving them an inhibitor chip, it takes away the emotions simply to make the clones look like they had no choice.

StarWars,"I'm not going to sit here and argue whether or not the new trilogy is good or not, and let me know if this has been brought up before, but Rey in all three movies sustains almost no *major* injuries.   


I was just thinking about it with a friend and we were talking about how Anakin gets horrifically mutilated at the hands of Count Dooku, and then again by his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi. On top of psychological trauma like watching his mother die in his arms, and being a slave as a child with his mother, and nearly dying in a pod race for mysterious space wizards who just wanted money to go home.

And then there is Luke who was protected by his friends and Ben for the most part in A New Hope, but he gets almost killed by the Wampa, his hand is cut off by Darth Vader, his aunt and uncle who were his strongest parental figures were burned alive by the empire, he watched his new friend get killed in front of him, is almost killed by a monster and squished in a trash compactor, he loses Biggs who was his childhood friend, he found out the identity of his father and then saved him only to have him then die in his arms, watched Yoda die in front of him, he was almost murdered in front of his father by Palpatine, and on top of it all he kissed his own sister. 

Rey was thrown into a tree by Kylo Ren knocking her out cold for a good amount of time but there was little to no noticeable physical damage to her, she definitely would have broken bones but you could never tell, she sees that Finn got hurt badly but didn't really have to worry about it because he ended up being fine. She loses Leia which absolutely is painful but was not as traumatic as watching someone you love dearly die in front of your eyes. All of the ""damage"" she takes is more or less completely unseen. You don't have to see someone get hurt to know they are hurting, but it just makes Rey feel even more infallible and overpowered.

Thus, they push the boundaries of cinema in ways that are fundamentally incompatible with the diluted, executive-driven processes employed by corporations for their valuable IPs. The virtues/values of SW (under Lucas) are fundamentally incongruent with ""story-groups"", or trying to push social agendas, and MOST importantly...  innovation.

I have been listening to a lot of Lucas interviews/ideas/articles, and the thing that stands out is that Star Wars literally CAN be anything. The guy made something unique, and yeah it is cool to hate on prequels and whatnot... but the GL literally said ""screw that noise"" and just stuck with the story he wanted to tell. His ideas are BOLD, and showcase an affinity to cinema that is almost unparalleled. He is an artist of an umpteenth degree, and I'll stick to that belief to the very end.

You got the most bankable franchise because of Lucas.

Not Iger, nor Alan Horn, Kennedy, def not creatives like Abrams or Rian. Their attempts at bottling that spark of Star Wars ultimately led to shrinking the visionary tenants the franchise was borne from.

It's not just guns going pew-pew, nor massive destroyers with a bad guys cloaked in black, nor is it a multitude things that will take a better part of the day to list.

It's all encompassing. It is cinematic tenants stretched in ways that are seen as unorthodox. It's built on non-conformity.

SW is silly, and experimental, and all-encompassing when it comes to cinema, and brings all that to the forefront. Largest art-house franchise in the world? YUP.

It is what led to its success, and the model needs to be fundamentally revamped if it is somehow to work under Disney (It won't. Quality might improve later on, but their model as of now is not indicative of being able to tackle this franchise the same way Lucas did.)

I honestly would've loved to see LucasFilm stay a private corp, but now they are beholden to share-holders and executives lending to many cooks in the kitchen.

Star Wars IS dead.

And no I am not talking in monetary terms. There is money on the table and a lot of it (vastly due to Lucas and all others who worked with him closely having the massive influence they've had)

But, the artistic inclinations it was built upon are dead.

Not to sound too pessimistic, but Star Wars as a brand is a different beast now. Don't judge on what came before, and maybe you can find some different artistic inclinations that might resonate with you.

Nothing lasts forever my dudes, and there's beauty in impermanence. Create something beautiful, and let it burn... art, bruhs.

TLDR: Star Wars as IP is too big. Disney loves money. Disney run by shareholders/executives. Disney wants as much mass-market as possible. Process of pleasing many people is detrimental with artistic inclinations being thwarted. So, Star Wars is a different beast now. Different art. Embrace that and don't be disappointed. Maybe.","Star Wars films are experimental, span multiple-genres, and highly technical. Thus...."

I also want to say, f*** whoever thought killing her off in the start was a good idea, she had so much potential in Star Wars, so much she could’ve done, so much we could’ve gotten with her, but no, apparently it’d be better if she was killed off in the start and never spoken of again. That is probably the only reason why I hate The Last Jedi.


One more thing, to give you a understanding of how much I love her, I’d rather be her more than me, I don’t care if I die at the same time, would be much better than my life now. I also (please don’t judge me) dream about different scenarios where she survived, for example, she was late, or got out of the hangar in time, or took off in time.

StarWars,"Solo-7/10 I liked this movie a lot but I found myself bored during the final 30 minutes of the film. 

The phantom menace-9/10 I throughly enjoyed this film and though liam neeson was a great qui gon. 

Attack of the clones-8/10 I didn’t like this as much as the phantom menace but I still loved it. And paddle was definitely my favourite character in this film!

Revenge of the sith-10/10 I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this film by far my favourite prequel. 

Rogue one-6/10 pretty average but I really liked the ending 40 minutes.

A new hope-10/10 instantly loved this film and already planning on watching again.

The empire strikes back-10/10 my favourite Star Wars film definitely a movie I will enjoy more and more with each rewatch

Revenge of the Jedi-9/10 my least favourite of the the OT but I still liked it a lot and it was an amazing end to a perfect trilogy.

The force awakens-7-10 I really liked this film a lot but I didn’t think it did anything particularly great.

The last Jedi-1/10 I HATE this film.

The rise of sky walker-3/10 I dislike this film quite a lot but it had some great moments.",I have just watched every Star Wars film for the first time and here is what I think of them!
StarWars,"I was rewatching The Rise of Skywalker and I once again came across the scene where Kylo heals Rey with the force. I have asked why Obi-Wan hadn't kept his master from dying and I have thought about the plot hole that they created in doing this but since there has been time for Disney to explain the whole force heal thing, is there a legitimate canon explanation as to why Qui Gon Jinn was not force healed when he easily could have been? Not hating on the sequels or anything I am just genuinely curious. Thanks :)",Canon Explanation for Obi-Wan not force-healing Qui Gon?
StarWars,"Ok so like a little under a year ago I had a dream about a Jedi padawan that got injured. Cant remember who it was or who his master was. It felt so real though, I also dreamed it in the clone wars animation, it was kinda weird but anyways. Later that day I had gym and we were playing frisbee and it was pretty windy and the idiots on my team just kept chucking it as was as they could. So basically I was doing nothing, I started day dreaming and expanding the dream I had the night before, and basically since then I have kinda been expanding it in my mind building more characters strengths and weakness to the characters. Im kinda obsessed now with my alternate universe. I also kinda reused some characters, such as Siri Tachi. It takes place during the clone wars and yes I know she died. But it my dream and she is legends anyways so she’s not dead, instead of getting shot in a place that would kill her she got shot in her leg or something. I haven’t read the book, just the stuff of wiki so I don’t know it that would work it’s just my head canon with my limited knowledge.

Anyways getting to the point. I recently started making a Google docs righting down everything that happened to these people, and every thing about them. I did this Because things kept getting lost in my mind and I couldn’t remember everything. For a few weeks now I thought of making it in to book form, but the thing is I’m a terrible writer I mean look at my grades. But I got bored today and decided why not if it was shit I could just delete it later. I’m on chapter 3, I don’t think it’s terrible, it’s definitely readable and I have done a lot better than I thought I would. Anyways the story itself is kinda long, but there’s sections I half the first half all built in my head I just need to write it. 

Now of course some characters I most certainly did not create such as Siri, Anakin, Ahsoka, obi-wan, Rex, the Jedi council peps, and so on. 


Some character names I have created are

So yeah, the name of the book is *In The Darkness.* as you can see in the title.",In The Darkness
StarWars,"I see people say Anakin was a bad seed in AotC and we see nothing good about him but I disagree. In the opening chase we see Obi Wan and Anakin bantering as they chase down Zam through the city and in the arena fight as well. There is clearly a bond between them like big and little brother. I also see people say that murdering younglings wasn’t a shock because he killed the tuskan raiders but it’s pretty obvious the sand people aren’t viewed as ‘people’ but monsters

Even then I disagree with the idea Anakin should have been completely noble and idealistic. In Empire when Yoda says to Obi Wan Luke has too much anger in him like his father (at this point Luke doesn’t know Vader is Anakin so I doubt Yoda meant Anakin in the present)

Sure some his dialogue is a bit clunky and cringey but I don’t think Anakin was all bad. We see his softer side along with his anxiety",Why do people say Anakin was a bad seed in AotC?
StarWars,"Just a fun what-if I wanted to make. Enjoy!

Everything would stay the same until the scene where kylo reveals Rey is a palpatine. Rey attempts to jump onto the falcon, like she did in the film, but is pulled back by kylo, with the force. The falcon is shot down by stormtroopers and crashes on kijimi, exploding. Finn protects Poe 3po bb-8 and d-o with a force bubble, which is how it is revealed he’s force sensitive. Poe says something like; “is this what you were going to tell her?” Finn nods. 

Then, as they try to repair the damage to the falcon, the knights of ren show up. Cue epic fight, in which Poe, Chewbacca, and Finn take on the knights of ren. Finn uses some sick force powers, and even kills one of them. A giant avalanche happens, causing a wall of snow to fall between the knights and the rebels. They go back to kijimi, where they explain to zorri the situation. 

Kylo attempts to take Rey to exegol, but she ends up snapping, using the force to make his ship crash in an asteroid field. They have the same fight that they would have had on the Death Star ruins, but instead on these asteroids. This would be a space battle, with them jumping from asteroids, and using the force to form air bubbles around themselves. The fight ends  with Rey electrocuting kylo with force Lightning, and she ends up taking kylo’s ship to kef bir. 

Meanwhile, the knights of ren call for backup, and sith troopers are deployed on kef bir.
Meanwhile, babu frik reveals he’s been building an army of droids, featuring b-1 battle droids, droidekas, b-2’s.. just a whole bunch. Babu also shows Finn a mega droid he had attempted to construct, powered by a damaged lightsaber. As the droid army fights the sith troopers, Finn attempts to fix the lightsaber. 

Meanwhile, Rey lands on kef bir, where she finds the ruins of the second Death Star. The same thing happens as in the movie, but instead of dark Rey simply spooking Rey, they end up having an extensive dual, which ends with Rey getting bombed by the knights of ren, having arrived to destroy the way finder. 

Rey fights them, and is overpowered. But then, kylo arrives. He claims he needs Rey to live, but the knights refuse, claiming that Rey needs to die. Kylo and Rey end up battling them, ending with a total wipeout of the knights of ren.(one or two of them have ambiguous deaths, such as being force pushed off the ruins. This is so they can return in future content.) kylo tells her that they need to go to exegol, but Rey attacks him again, exhausted. 

The same thing happens that happened in the movie, and the film goes the same way, until Rey leaves ach to. Since Poe and Finn are on kijimi, other resistance fighters get a chance to shine in this final battle. A much more intense space battle occures, with, instead of just having to take out a power signal, we have a prequel-like battle in the skies, with the return of ships like mon calamari cruisers. Meanwhile, The battle is looking hopeless for the droid army, as they are being overwhelmed. Then Finn emerges, with the lightsaber repaired, glowing with an emerald blade.

The movie goes the same, and it’s intercut between the space fight, Rey kylo and palpatine on the surface, and kijimi. Rey is about to kill palpatine and complete the ritual, when ben arrives, and Rey and him attempt to Overtake palpatine. They are beaten by him, and, Rey reluctantly agrees to do the ritual. Kylo objects, and pleads to palpatine to possess him instead. Despite reys objections, ben does so, slaughtering palpatine and allowing him to possess him. 

Palpatine, now in bens body, falls on his lightsaber with the force. He ignites it and duals Rey. Eventually, ben regained control temporarily, and kills himself by stabbing his lightsaber through his chest. As he dies, he tells Rey that he’s sorry. The movie continues as it did otherwise, with the rebels destroying the fleet, and the sith eternal falling. 

Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca, along with the droid army, beat the sith trooper Army on kijimi, and everyone reunites on Ajan kloss, where they learn of leia’s death. They mourn, but celebrate her, and the heroes of the rebellion that led them here. We flash forward years in the future, at night. R2 is outside the new Jedi temple, projecting a hologram to a floating cloaked figure. The hologram ends, and the figure floats off into the night.

IIRC Anakin never said this, and further Obi-Wan talks about Anakin as though he was a separate person from Vader (bc everyone doesn’t know the twist yet) so he’s definitely talking about Jedi Knight pre Mustafar Anakin.

StarWars,"I was rewatching Attack of the Clones yesterday and noticed that the Republic becoming aware of the Clones was due to a series of lucky coincidences that even Sidious couldn’t have planned. 

- Jango sends Zam to use killer millipedes. 
- Obi-Wan leaps through the window and manages to grab the droid, which comes flying back to Zam. 
- Zam shoots the droid but Anakin manages to catch Obi-Wan and they manage to spot Zam and go after her. 
- They manage to keep up with her and follow her to the bar. 
- Zam decides she’s going to try to kill Obi-Wan rather than sneak out the bar while they’re distracted. 
- Jango managed to track them to the bar and rather than shoot her, hits her with a poison dart that he got from Kamino. 
- Obi-Wan only finds out about Kamino after going to Dexter, after Dooku painstakingly deleted all references of Kamino from the Jedi Archives.

But Rogue One was excellent. I loved it from start to finish. The ending fight scene was great. There were so many amazing scenes. The story, although it was really only written to explain a plot issue with the Death Star, was actually pretty good. Character development was good, the characters were interesting and entertaining. 

It was also the first Star Wars movie where there wasn’t a sudden heroic rise at the end where the heroes manage to win and escape death. They achieved their goal. But practically all of them died in doing so. I even liked Krennic as the villain. Mads was obviously brilliant in the movie as he is in everything, and K-2SO was actually the first time I’ve appreciated comedic relief in a Star Wars movie for a long time. I just thought it was brilliant and really don’t think it gets enough recognition for actually managing to live up to the high standards of the original movies, and while it isn’t as good as them, it still hit the nail on the head with practically every aspect of the movie.",Rogue One was Great
StarWars,"In the late 70s/ early 80s, I was not alive, however the portrayal of the Jedi were cunning warriors, peacekeepers of the galaxy, people you dressed your kids as for Halloween. Not much was known about them since they were all dead in the original stories we grew to love, Other than Luke, who truly became a real Jedi at the end of ROTJ, and solidified what it meant to be a Jedi. Someone with composure, self control, and upmost humility. (which is why I’m not a fan of the direction luke was taken in TLJ, but that conversation is for another time and doesnt matter right now)

Fast forward to George Lucas’s prequels, when we finally got to see what the Jedi order was like. They were portrayed as extremely flawed and egotistical, which ultimately lead to their failure.

And you know what? that’s pretty genius and genuinely such and interesting idea. I believe it’s a great story that the Jedi were responsible for their own downfall.

As more and more Star Wars canon was added, the clone wars, and a line in TLJ where Luke tells Rey how flawed they are. We have come to only know the Jedi as selfish and failures. Even Ashoka no longer claims the Jedi as her people.

Which once again I will say, is a great story to tell, and it has been told.

Reys story kind of embraces the positive traits of the Jedi and I love that about her, but I never got the feeling that she truly understood what being a Jedi is about, and I don’t really consider her to be an ideal “Jedi” at this point, she’s just a good person who follows a path that enables her to help people, and she happens to have a connection with the force.

But i really believe it’s time to bring back the word “Jedi” and make it an optimistic and hopeful word, someone you aspire to be like. Someone we wanted to be when we were kids, maybe a storyline where someone accepts the flaws of the Jedi, but chooses to move past it and and embrace all of the positive qualities of the Jedi. 

Maybe even training a new era of Jedi, and redefining them so they are made into what Jedi were originally thought to be.

tl;dr: I’m a rambling idiot",I really want a storyline in a film/series where the Jedi are redeemed/ brought back to the original “heroes” they were originally portrayed as while also respecting canon.

StarWars,"# Order 66 / The Chip

**I have questions.**

* So, let's say you knew about order 66. If you sent a holo message of a convincingly Darth Sidious looking dude saying ""execute order 66"", would they then go jedi-genocide?
* Does the chip programming end? Or is it it like popping a fuse and that's just how they are now?
* It seems like many of the clones were genuinely fond of their Jedi compatriots, how did that affect their psyche after order 66? Maybe the chip affect is permanent just to stop them from mental breakdowns?
* Could trauma/electricity/other damage to/around the chip enable/disable it?
* Obviously not every clone saw the Sidious message, how did they go all order 66?  Is it a social cohesion thing where they see other clones attacking jedi and so that means ""I guess it's jedi killin' time!""
   * If that's the case, why didn't it become a massacre when Tup killed Tiplar in The Clone Wars?

**An answer: Secret Handshake?**

I actually think it might have been an interesting touch that there was a kind of secret handshake, magic word, or other secondary trigger to cause a clone to trigger another clone. So, instead of all the other clones in the area seemingly miraculously instantly being on the same page about it, there would be a wave of murderous intent, which could have interesting story / scene / cinematic implications. You wouldn't necessarily need to explain it, you could just show it, and I think it would be pretty clear what was happening.  
But that doesn't appear to be what happened.

Alternatively...

**Answer: Clone Genocide Pulse?**

*OH! I got it! I'l make an excuse for Star Wars!  Time to jump through some mental hoops for a clever retcon... Star Wars style! Seriously, that's a giant chunk of Star Wars since Empire.*

Anyway, what if each clone had \*two\* ways to go order 66?

1. Direct order from Darth Sidious. This causes you to go order 66, but at the same time emits some kind of pulse to all other clones in the area.  Presumably this would be powered by some kind of biological energy store, probably good for 1 shot.
2. Receive the order 66 pulse from another clone, then send out that order 66 pulse to make sure you get everyone in the area. Clones far away from the original order could still be in murder mode almost instantly.

*This brings up new questions:*

* Could you stop them from going order 66 if you stuck them in a Faraday cage?
* Does Tup's malfunction mess up this idea?
   * I guess not necessarily, but it seems like he likely would have triggered the other clones. Makes it suddenly a little bit more of an odd stretch, but nothing crazy. I work as a programmer. Bugs do strange things sometimes.",Order 66 / Compliance Chips - I have Questions. Also: Genocide pulse idea

I mean, it would be a pretty cool story. 
For example a poor farmer who's family died and the jedi just did nothing to safe them, so she wants to get the force to help those who the jedi ignores.

StarWars,"Vice Admiral Holdo gets a TON of shit for not disclosing her plan way earlier, but I’m not going to touch on that further. 

My question is: why couldn’t the “mutineers” have simply told Holdo

&gt; Hey, I don’t know what your plan is, but we have a plan that gets us literally light speeds away from the FO, and here’s our pitch

They didn’t have to “mutiny.” 

I put it in quotes because it’s not really mutineering when they all have the general shared, broad goals. 

They still could have pitched the plan — which IMO would have been approved by Holdo since it’s sacrificing 2 for a 100% shot of saving hundreds rather than hoping that the FO doesn’t realize that dozens of carriers going to the nearest/only inhabitable planet are evacuating — and she could have still rejected it, and they could have still mutineered and had gone with the plan anyway.

**TLDR — nobody chiming in with, “well, Poe should have pitched their own sound, reasonable plan to Holdo instead of hiding it as a mutineer”? Even if he got rejected, what changes if they go on and mutiny all the same anyway?**","(The Last Jedi) TLJ spoilers, also controversy incoming.

StarWars,"So before I get crucified I just want to say that I *did* enjoy the episode overall. It was good. Nothing life-changing, but good. 

However, ever since the episode landed I've been seeing countless threads on this sub with titles along the lines of ""This is the greatest thing to ever come from Star Wars"", ""thank you Dave Filoni for reigniting my love for SW"", ""OMG, I'm STILL CRYING after this"" etc etc.

Am I the only person here who thinks there's just TOO MUCH HYPE over this episode? Even just a tad? 

Like I mentioned, I did enjoy the episode; but on imdb this episode is listed as the fourth highest rated episode of any TV show. Ever. It wasn't THAT amazing! I honestly though the two ""Seige of Mandalore"" episodes were considerably better.

Some 'issues' I had with the episode... 

1. The Darth Maul hallway scene was ripped straight out of Rogue One. I don't have a problem with this in and of itself but the praise for this scene has made me realise that there is a HUGE double standard when it comes to the fan base.

It's like: Disney copies something from OT = ""bad writing""; TCW copies something from Disney movie = ""Dave Filoni is a genius! This is the best thing SW has ever done!"" 

2. Order 66 was kind of underwhelming. Having spent the last two weeks marathoning TCW and Rebels, I already knew Ahsoka and Rex were going to survive order 66 and go on to have a strong friendship. Yet everyone on reddit is raving about how ""tense"" this episode was. 

Also, in Rebels, Rex mentioned he had his inhibitor chip taken out, but we're led to believe this happened BEFORE Order 66, not AFTER the order had already been issued. And what about Wolf and Gregor (if I remembered their names correctly)? When did their chips get taken out? 

3. Am I the only one who had a problem with Ahsoka **willfully** freeing Maul so that he could kill some clones all for the sake of a distraction? I mean, I get that she was in a tough spot and I suppose it isn't the worst tactic given the circumstances. My problem is this: throughout the show Ahsoka is regularly shown as being a good person with a high moral code, one who has developed a close relationship with the clone troopers, so the thought of her intentionally freeing Maul **knowing** that he was going to on a murder spree with these clones (what if Maul killed Rex?) didn't really sit well with me. It felt out of character for Ahsoka. At no other point throughout the show do I recall any instance where Ahsoka willfully put others in danger to save herself. Again, I realise she was in a tough situation but it just didn't sit well with me. 

Anyway, thanks for hearing my rant I guess lol. I'm still looking forward to the last episode, I just hope it's better than this one. This episode didn't live up to the hype for me. 

What do you guys think? Does anyone agree? Or am I just some kind of madman for thinking this?","Am I the only one who thought ""Shattered"" WASN'T all that great?"
StarWars,"My personal ranking is 

- Star Wars Galaxy Adventures. 
- Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)
- Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003)
- Star Wars Resistance 
- Star Wars Forces of Destiny
- Star Wars Rebels 

To me, Galaxy Adventures is the peak character design and style in the Star Wars universe. 2008 Clone Wars is probably the most recognizable and well-known after the canon movie designs, and even with giraffe neck Anakin, 2003 Clone Wars has a classic and nostalgic feel to it despite the crazily exaggerated proportions. Resistance has a slew of great character designs, even if the shading/shadowing in the animation looks strange at times. Forces of Destiny is not really that well known, and some of the character designs/animation is straight up not good (Leia for instance), but Anakin/Padme/Obi-Wan have solid designs, and Yoda doesn’t look like a ketamine soaked loaf of bread. Which brings me to Rebels; I don’t actually hate the design in Rebels, the quality is there and the animation moves fluidly. It’s that after The Clone Wars, something about it is so off-putting, IMO. Maybe it’s because everything looks like it’s been put through a slimming filter (looking at you Ahsoka), I don’t honestly know. If I could base it off Anakin-Vader and young/old Obi-Wan’s designs alone, it’d be near the top. But then there’s non-Vader Anakin and his floppy hair, Sidious's weird chin and chiclet teeth, and of course, the infamous and much hated on Yoda. Overall the bad character designs overshadow the good ones for me. 

I’m curious to hear other opinions though!",How would you rank the character designs and quality of the Star Wars animated series?
StarWars,"I refer, of course, to the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each race has a lot to them, but how well do you think they could do in the SW universe?

Here are my thoughts on each faction:

**Terrans**  
They'd stomp in ground fights with Marines, Siege Tanks, etc., but in space battles they could be beaten by Star Destroyers. However, the Terrans have much easier cloaking access, so Wraiths could take apart Star Destroyers. The Death Star could be a problem, but a few Ghosts could take it out if they infiltrate it.

**Zerg**  
Totally overpowered. The Star Wars universe has never (to my knowledge) faced an enemy quite like the Zerg. Any planet would get overrun in days, and in space battles they'd never be able to handle that many Zerg. Sheer numbers alone would win the Zerg many a fight, but their adaptability would also ensure the SW races wouldn't be able to effectively counter them. The Death Star could be easily infested by the Zerg, and its weapon would not be truly effective against them since the Zerg don't really rely on any one planet.

**Protoss**  
Overpowered. They would dominate ground fights with their Zealots, their Templars could be a handful for even the most powerful Jedi or Sith, and their capital ships would decimate any SW fleet. Plus the Protoss have plenty of planet-destroying weapons, so the Death Star wouldn't beat them.",How well do you think the Starcraft factions would do in the Star Wars universe?
StarWars,"In finale of Episode 9 Rey travels to Tatooine, finds an old Luke's place, then called herself Skywalker.

Why she did that? I have an answer. She is mother of Anakin Skywalker. She traveled not only to Tattoine, but back in time to give birth for Anakin. Obviously, she was impregnated by Kylo Ren, when he healed her. It was made through the force, so there is why Anakin is so strong. 

An evidence for this we can find partially in Episode 1. Mother of Anakin tells that Anakin was like impregnated by Force itself. Well, technically it's true, because Kylo and Rey never had real sex (mostly due to PG-13 rating).

Another part of evidence we can see in Ep. 8, where she saw herself in that cave. She is past, present and the future. She is the time loop itself.

How she traveled through time? I dunno. Somehow. A lot of things going in Episode 9 somehow, why not this one?

Why she didn't fight back the raiders in Ep.2? Maybe, she lost connection to the Force during time travel.

So, she called herself Skywalker, cause she knew she will be the mother of Anakin.

But all this stuff leads us to interesting things. Kylo, in fact, his own grandgrandpa and he is father of his own grandpa. And his mother is own granddaughter. Palpatine is Anakin's grandgranddaddy via Rey. Family connections are complicated in this family.",I have insane theory. Rey is mother of Anakin Skywalker
StarWars,"Upon viewing the recent episode of TCW, in which Order 66 takes place and Ahsoka is on the run from her clones aboard the Venator, a few random questions popped into my head and maybe the answers are obvious.

Number one: what happened to Cut Lawquane when Order 66 was issued? If you remember, Cut was the clone who deserted the Grand Army of the Republic and started a family on Saleucami. Anyways, surely nobody contacted him about Order 66, but his chip was activated right? Would his demeanor change? Or would he remain the same as there were no Jedi present?

Number two: How does Order 66 work exactly? More specifically, why does Sideous even need to contact the clones and tell them to execute Order 66 if there are chips in their heads that can simply be activated? How many calls did he have to make? Because based on the context from the movie/show, he calls certain clone commanders individually, and then the commanders relay the massage to their men.

Again, the new episode got me thinking, and maybe the answer is right in front of me, but if anybody knows the answers, my wandering mind will be at ease. Thanks!",A few questions about Order 66
StarWars,"So I haven't watched rise of skywalker yet so my knowledge isn't complete which is why I am asking 

In the original trilogy prequels and comics we all know sidious wanted a true apprentice one that will surpass him 

In rise of skywalker sidious cloned himself but it didn't work because the citadel had not prepared yet as his betrayal happend earlier than expected.

So why not clone anakin/vader and teach him how to transfer his spirit into a new body 

He could have prepared a body and when it was ready he could have had anakin transfer his conciouness 

that way vader would be full power",Rise of skywalker plothole
StarWars,"Rogue One is unironically my favorite Star Wars movie, and I think a big reason why is that there's very little actual Jedi in the plot. I'm not quite on team EmpireDidNothingWrong but I must admit that the Jedi are just generally unlikable. They're arrogant and conceited, and despite the fact that Eepisode III is a meme and really not that great of a movie, it was honestly kind of satisfying to see the Jedi get taken down more than a couple of pegs.

Going back to Rogue One, it's fantastic not only because of the plot and the action and them actually sticking to the plot, it's fantastic because there's very little actual Jedi actually involved in the movie (and Ben Mendelssohn did a fantastic acting job as Director Krennic)",Did anyone else find the near total lack of actual Jedi involvement in Rogue One to be one of the best things about that movie?
StarWars,"I’m sure I sound stupid, but what was Vader’s position in the empire? Was he like the VP to Palpatine, or was that Tarkin? It seemed like he was the one sent to kill someone/deal with Luke, and didn’t seem to be appreciated very much at the meeting in the Death Star in ep4. Was it like Snoke and Kylo Ren where he was just kinda part of it because he was Snoke’s apprentice and he mostly just did his own thing?

Edit: Thanks everyone who responded, now I realize he was the Dwight to Palpatine’s Michael Scott",What was Vader’s role in the empire?
StarWars,"Note: this is MY opinion and you may comment any other ideas you have if you think what I say doesn't make sense or something.

Starting off, I think Palpatine isn't dead. Vader killed him in episode 6, and now Rey did the same in episode 9. We have confirmed that in episode 9 Sheev is a clone. So what prevents him from using the clones again after the events of episode 9? 

I think another movie to finish off the saga could work. Again, feel free to disagree, and I know that people will probably not like the move away from movie trilogy's, but if we get a movie that has Rey, maybe even some other characters that are still alive from TV shows or just people that haven't been killed off (such as the Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and Sabine). 

If a movie with all characters from all movies comes out, that is made well and isn't rushed, that takes time to think about and stuff, I believe the fan base would like it. 

Again, I'm not sure about this, it's just me thinking about it, I haven't asked any friends what they thought of it, any other opinions or feedback is welcome.",What I believe Disney could do to better the sequel trilogy
StarWars,"&gt; A silent buzzing vibration came from a compartment concealed within his armor. Cody frowned. ""Go on ahead, General. We'll be right behind you."" That concealed compartment held a secure comlink, which was frequency-locked to a channel reserved for the commander in chief. Kenobi nodded and spoke to his mount, and the great beast overleapt the clone commander on its way down into the battle. Cody withdrew the comlink from his armor and triggered it.

&gt; A holoscan appeared on the palm of his gauntlet: a hooded man.

&gt; *""It is time,""*, the holoscan said. *""Execute Order Sixty-Six.""*

&gt; Cody responded as he had been trained since before he'd even awakened in his creche-school. ""It will be done, my lord."" The holoscan vanished. Cody stuck the comlink back into its concealed recess and frowned toward where Kenobi rode his dragonmount into selfhessly heroic battle.  
&gt; Cody was a clone. He would execute the order faithfully, without hesitation or regret. But he was also human enough to mutter glumly, ""Would it have been too much to ask for the order to have come through *before* I gave him back the bloody *lightsaber*...?""

&gt; The order is given once. Its wave-front spreads to clone commanders on Kashyyyk and Felucia, Mygeeto and Tellanroaeg and every battlefront, every military installation, every hospital and rehab center and spaceport cantina in the galaxy.

&gt; Except for Coruscant.

&gt; On Coruscant, Order Sixty-Six is already being executed.

(I'm skipping the scene where Bail Organa goes to investigate the situation at the Jedi Temple)

&gt; Order Sixty-Six is the climax of the Clone Wars.  
&gt; Not the end - the Clone Wars will end some few hours from now, when a coded signal, sent by Nute Gunray from the secret Separatist bunker on Mustafar, deactivates every combat droid in the galaxy at once - but the climax.  
&gt; It's not a thrilling climax: it's not the culmination of an epic struggle. Just the opposite, in fact. The Clone Wars were never an epic struggle. They were never intended to be.  
&gt; What is happening right now is why the Clone Wars were fought in the first place. It is their reason for their existence. The Clone Wars have always been, in and of themselves, from their very inception, the revenge of the sith.  
&gt; They were irresistible bait. They took place in remote locations, on planets that belonged, primarily, to ""somebody else."" They were fought by expendable proxies. And they were constructed as a win-win situation.  
&gt; The Clone Wars were the perfect Jedi trap.  
&gt; By fighting at all, the Jedi lost.  
&gt; While the Jedi Order overextended, spread thin across the galaxy, each Jedi is alone, surrounded only by whatever clone troops he, she, or it commands. War itself pours darkness into the Force, deepening the cloud that limits Jedi perception. And the clones have no malice, no hatred, not the slightest ill intent that might give warning. They are only following orders.  
&gt; In this case, Order Sixty-Six.  
&gt; Hold-out blasters appear in clone hands. ARC-170s drop back onto the tails of Jedi starfighters. AT-STs swivel their guns. Turrets on hovertanks swung silently.  
&gt; Clones open fire, and Jedi die.

StarWars,"So I was playing Battlefront 2 (2017) and I noticed some blaster rifles, specifically the E-11, E11-D and A280  and likely many others had very clear parts that wouldn't initially seem relevant for a energy weapon, a magazine, a cocking handle and clear chamber, etc.  


Now to be clear I know that the original props were old ww2 guns, made to look sci-fi, but is there any explanation in cannon or legends that explains why the guns have these parts, or is it something we're meant to turn a blind eye to, because ***gun goes pew***",Is there an universe explanation for blaster rifles having ballistic rifle parts?
StarWars,"I have just finished The Mandalorian again, and in the last episode Moff Giden said something that left me wondering. He talked about the Siege of Mandalore, and some kind of ""Purge"", carried by the Empire. Now, I'm currently watching the Clone Wars flawless finale, the Siege of Mandalore, and I've seen said Siege, but carried on by the Republic, against the mandalorian's faithful to Maul, the Mauldalorians. 

&amp;#x200B;

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",darth plaugis
StarWars,"     I’ve always wondered if it would have worked out better if they didn’t introduce the inhibitor chip in Clone Wars. If you look at Episode 3 and the original Battlefront 2 it seems the intention was to have Order 66 be a code for if the Jedi ever went rogue, that Sidious just took advantage of. If they did it this way then it would have been left up to each clone to take out their respective Jedi and not mind control. I wonder if that would have worked better, with any clone that wouldn’t comply, due to a personal connection, being branded a traitor as well.
      I just thought about this again yesterday because the latest episode of Clone Wars sort of muddied how the inhibitor chip works, with Rex being able to communicate with Ahsoka while not having control over his actions.
      I know I’m arguing semantics over a poorly written scenario but I can’t help but wonder which way would have fit better.","Clone Wars, better without the inhibitor chip?"

So, why didn't the empire commission a bunch of these? I think I read somewhere it was primarily an assassin Droid. But even if they were super expensive or resource heavy to commit one Droid is worth dozens of troopers who need constant care and 100% loyal to it's protocol. 

I feel like an army of 100 of those dudes would be worth way more than any number of Stormtroopers. Is there a lore reason they didn't? Are these droids not actually that good and IG-11 was unique/plot deviced?",Question. Why didn't the empire use IG droids?

Last month however, Disney+ revealed that the last episode of TCW would be aired and I was curious. I started watching the clone wars and was completely hooked. I quickly realized that if I wanted to catch the series finale I would have to watch A LOT. I’ve been doing that for 2 days and realized o only have about hour and a half of clone wars left. Maybe it’s because I just watched the Ashoka episode but I just feel empty.

I’ve been so hooked on the series I never realized it would actually end - I feel absolutely heartbroken and sad. I intend to watch Rebels after TCW but was informed that it wasn’t that good. 

I JUST BADLY WANT THE CLONE WARS TV SHOW TO LAST FOREVER. Ik that sounds pretty selfish and I know it must come to an end sometime but I do not think any Cartoon Series ever could relocate the effect TCW has on me.

But they all are well aware that Ashoka is not a jedi, just a civilian and Maul is definitely not a jedi, yet clones tried to execute them both. My question is why. Especially considering that Rex is very close to Ashoka it seems hard to believe that he would not go by with the logic of 'I am ordered to kill jedi, she is not a jedi, I don't have to kill her'.

StarWars,"Is it just me or are the prequels closer to a Galactic Civil War than the Originals which we call the ""Galactic Civil War""

The Prequels are about thousands of planets that are leaving the Republic called the Separatists(People who want the republic to seperate). So we have 2 massive sides waging a War, with one side trying to keep the Republic together and protected, and the other trying to take over the Republic.

The Originals are about a group of rebels from certain planets, that are completely outnumbered by their opponent, which is the current government. So wouldn't this be more like a Galactic Revolutionary War? Or just a series of terrorist attacks on major military stations in hopes it will collapse said government.

StarWars,"I'm sure it goes without saying, but these last few *Clone Wars* episodes have been phenomenal and I figured I may as well add to the dozens of other posts on the matter. My hope for the very last scene would go something like this:

After faking their deaths (if that part of the *Ahsoka* novel remains canon), Ahsoka and Rex say their goodbyes and go their separate ways. Ahsoka boards a ship, perhaps the Silver Angel, and once in space she stares out among the stars. The music swells into something hopeful, but after a moment the score fades into something more ominous and the scene cuts to Darth Vader on the bridge of a Venator - also staring out into the stars.

StarWars,"So This Is An Idea I Had At One Point And I've Built Up On It Ever Since, Sorry If It's Bad...

So The Main Character/Protagonist Of The Story Is: Maxwell Lenoda (LEN-OH-DAH)

A Separatist Citizen In His Late Twenties Living On Raxus Prime Throughout The Clone Wars, He Would Be A Simple Guy Trying To Get Along In Life. He Is A Skilled Technician And Mainly Helps Maintain The Equipment In The Local Droid Foundry. He Keeps To Himself A Lot And Only Really Talks To His Colleagues At Work And His Little Sister Which He Holds Very Dear To Him. He Doesn't Care Much For The War Since To Him, It's A Distant Conflict That He'd Rather Not Concern Himself With.

The Other Main Character Is: Lily Lenoda, Maxwell's Younger Sister By A Few Years.

She Is A Carefree Girl Who Loves Her Brother Very Much, She's Also A Bit Of A Klutz, More Often Than Not Tripping Over Her Own Feet When Running Around. The War Is Practically Invisible To Her, She Know's There Is One, But Like Maxwell, Doesn't Care Much For it. Her World Revolves Around Her Brother, As She Is Very Clingy To Him, But She Does Know When To Lay Off.

The Two Are Inseparable, Only A Power Akin To A Thousand Suns Could Tear Them Apart.......Which Is What This War Would Exactly Do...

The Purpose Of The Film Isn't To Add Major Things To Any Existing Lore In The Series, But To Simply Describe And Show The Life Of The Average Citizen Of A Faction That Was Made To Fail...

The Film Wouldn't Show To Much Fighting As That's Not What It's Meant To Do, It Would Show The Inner Politics Of The C.I.S. In A Few Scenes But Not Too Much As To Not Bore The Viewer With Constant Bickering Over Internal Affairs.

However This Is Still A Star Wars Film, And So, In The Latter Half Of The Film, It Would Show The War Finally Reach The Confederacy's Doorstep, This Would Be The Only Major Addition To The Lore. The Battle Of Raxus Prime Would Be A Hard And Grueling Battle For Republic Forces, As The Separatists Had Fortified Raxus After The Failed Attack On Coruscant. It Would Show Separatist Droids And Even Militia Men Fight The Republic Invaders. Maxwell, Lily, And Many Other Citizens Would Simply Be Caught In The Cross-Fire Either Hiding Or Trying To Find A Transport To Get Them Off World.

The Battle Would Seem In The Separatists Favor, But Then Would Turn Sour As Order 66 Is Executed And The Droid Shutdown Command Is Sent Out, Leaving Only The Armed Militia Men To Fight The Clones. At The End Of it All, Maxwell And Lily Would Meet Their Ends At The Hand Of A Republic Artillery Cannon That Was Aiming At The Same Foundry Maxwell Worked At And Had Recently Arrived At To Hide Away.

And Thus The Film Would End Off With It Showing Raxus Prime Falling Under Imperial Rule And The Destruction Of The C.I.S. Remnant Forces On Other Planets.

Like I Said, This Film Isn't Meant To Convey A Message About The Force, Or Tell A Tale About Ancient Jedi And Sith Fighting A Bloody Battle, It's Meant To Show The Hardships Of Everyday Citizens Living Under The Flag Of The Confederacy Of Independent Systems And Their Fate At The Hands Of The Galactic Empire.

StarWars,"I just wanted to point something out about the clones with how they behave after Order 66. Back in season 5 (I think), when Tip carried out Order 66, notice how he sort of tried to kill Tiplee by slowly walking towards her in the middle of a *battle.* He was under the effects of Order 66 and clearly made no effort to preserve himself despite the obvious risk. Now look at the new episode. In every instance of the clones engaging Ahsoka, they're blindly rushing towards her, regardless of who's in the way. I know blindly carries the connotation of doing something because you don't know any better, but the clones do. Unlike Tup, who was reduced to rambling, the clones in these episode are fully aware of their surroundings and can hold their own in a fight, which makes sense. They're to hunt down any Jedi, no matter the cost, even at their own lives.

Now look at Maul's encounter with the clones. It's clear that they're panicking and are trying to contain him. Hell, some of them even run after being disarmed, both literally and figuratively. They're actively trying to distance themselves from him, yet when Rex, Jesse, and the other clones ambush Ahsoka in the briefing room, they're rushing in there, firing blindly despite the fact that their CO is on the *same end where their blasters are pointed.* I don't know anything when it comes to the military, but I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge that you DON'T point a weapon that can very easily kill people in the general direction of someone important.

Another example was in the last moments of the episode, when they try to storm the medical bay. Again, they're blindly Zerg rushing Ahsoka, despite the fact that they're in a very disadvantageous position.

And yes, I know that maybe it's actually part of their training and that there's a method to their madness, but Tup also showed the same level of suicidal obedience, and that was just one clone. Also, it may also be a possibility that the reason Tup was practically comatose was because his inhibitor chip malfunctioned instead of being properly activated. As a general rule, if a program does something too early, it probably won't do it as well of it was properly run, but that's up for debate and discussion.

Tl:Dr;

I hope you enjoy, those who see this, and I apologize in advance for any tears shed. I was crying while I wrote this. Here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

Dear fandom  
How to say to you?  
Sometime last night  
Fives said his final farewell  
Like a flame that flickers out too soon, he died, he's gone... 

We dedicate every binge-watching to you   
You changed this fandom,   
You helped make the Clones human   
And when you're on screen   
We all cheer for you   
And we never really move on

You had come of age through the Clone Wars  
We cheered and cried for you  
Sometimes that’s all we’d do

You and your brothers built a strong foundation  
And we were there with you  
The way was clear for you  
And you blew us all away (every day)

Every day, every day  
You blew us all away (every day)  
Every day, everyday  
You blew us all away (every day)  
Every day

Ooh  
Every day  
You blew us all away  
Every day",Dear Fives
StarWars,"The first ark comes out and people like it enough, no one seems crazy about it.

The second ark comes out and Reddit seems to question why they even made a 7th season.

The third ark comes out and everyone acts like Filoni is God's gift to entertainment, and asking why we are only getting 12 episodes. 

I love Filoni as much as the next guy, but he has made good episodes of Clone Wars, great episodes of Clone Wars, and bad episodes of Clone Wars. Have we also forgotten he wrote and directed what many believe to be the worst episode of The Mandalorian? Him doing the sequel trilogy would not have made it guaranteed that it was great. 

People complain about the ""kiddy"" aspects of the new trilogy and praise the realism of Rogue One, but want the guy who gave us puffer pigs and space whales to be in charge. 

Ideally I think it would be best if Favreau and Filoni together were the Kevin Feige of Star Wars. With Favreau focusing on everything live action, and Filoni covering the animated projects, as well as the comics and novels. With the 2 of them working together to make everything connect.",This season of the Clone Wars has shown how much of a short term memory the Star Wars fan base has.
StarWars,"I’m a bit confused on to why people keep making youtube videos conplaining and criticizing the new star wars films. When I found out that Disney bought Star Wars back in 2012, I understood that Star Wars as we knew it was over and that the story finished at Return of the Jedi. Whatever we would get after, it could not belong to that story any more for the simple fact that it was not going to be told by George Lucas.

So I never saw these new movies as being part of the “canon”. How could they be if they are being told by Disney? In fact the movies are just a remake of Episodes 4 to 6. They are a story of their own and only take characters from the Lucas Movies as a basis. The naming of episode 7 to 8 is just a marketing strategy but I never bought it. Force Awakens is almost the same story as New Hope. And in both trilogies end the same way: the heroe defeats Palpatine.

I watched these new movies without connecting them to the Lucas movies and I thought the movies were good. Obviously they are made for children and I (I’m 34) onviously find a lot of things in these movies that are silly, but these films were not made for people my age. It’s what Disney does. 

I feel like fans should stop complaining. Lucas decided to sell Star Wars. And from that moment, Disney has the right to do whatever they want with it and its characters...",Why are the Star Wars fans so upset about the sequel trilogy?
StarWars,"Watching it today after the latest Clone Wars and moly mama, the movie honestly is REALLY good. People argue Anakin's turn was too quick but the movie does an EXCELLENT job of showing how out of place and ostracized Anakin felt at every turn. 

He couldn't tell Padme too much about the dreams (His last came true). He couldn't tell The Council or Obi-Wan about Padme or his baby.

When he told Yoda about her upcoming death, he basically said don't worry about it, it's only natural... Don't attach to her, be emotionless. Anakin is all about emotion and at every turn, he was wronged... Every turn except Sheev.

When he was on the council, he was allowed there but wasn't granted the rank of master. This was something NEVER done before and for someone who was supposed to be the chosen one, this felt like a HUGE grievance against him. Mace Windu proudly ostracized and belittled Anakin at every turn then almost killed his only chance to save his wife. 

When he killed the younglings, he probably felt like he was saving them from a life of suffering under the Jedi like he did. Padme and Anakins romance was way better than the AOTC and felt like people who actually cared.... Weird people.

That is all, the movie is actually good and I'd rate it over every single sequel movie. It is the best SW film imo (Empire 2nd). ANH is legendary but Luke is VERY bland in that film, exceptionally so and the film is pretty standard feeling. That's probably blasphemy but it's true. It's a mediocre film that gained a ridiculous amount of traction die to the immense creativity and love behind the universe .",Revenge of the Sith is WAY better than it's given credit
StarWars,"I am going to start off by saying I am not a big fan of the sequels but I appreciate the memories and enjoyment it brought while watching it with my siblings. I also appreciate the great visuals throughout the movies especially the way TLJ was shot. I didn't like the direction the Sequels took regarding Luke's Character but that's a discussion for another time. 

The one thing I really wanted to see explored was the Force was balance and what it really means. They talked a bit about balance in TLJ but didn't seem to explore it in TROS. We see from the prequels and the original trilogy. The Jedis rejection completely of passion and love drove Anakin to the dark side and the eventual demise of the Jedi. We also see that the Sith's complete acceptance of selfishness and indulgent ways can lead to a person with good intentions become corrupt. Both views are extremely polarizing from the Jedi and Sith. I would have hoped to see what balance really meant and Luke's Jedi order be open to all aspects of the force as Palpatine put it. I remember during the marketing of the Sequels they depicted kylo and Snoke as dark side users and not just Sith. I thought that would have been explored but it never was. I think this came from a lack of vision and a cohesive story but wha can you do. 

Do any of you wish these themes were explore the more   deep and thematic aspects of the force?",Exploration of the Force
StarWars,An animated tv show that has characters never even seen in a movie did a better job of making me feel any emotion than anything in the sequels. The characters are far superior. The storytelling is far superior. Dave Filoni is the true successor to George Lucas. Watching these animated characters grow together and then suddenly have to turn on each other against their will was heartbreaking. Seeing Rex tear up when he’s about to shoot Ashoka knowing full well what he was doing was a lot more emotional than watching Rey scream for 3 movies then kill Palpatine in a pretty phoned in way then claim she was a Skywalker. The episode is fantastic. The arc is fantastic. Filoni is outstanding and is truly the best storyteller we’ve gotten since George and it’s not even close.,Season 7 episode 11 of the Clone Wars was far more emotional than anything in the sequel trilogy.
StarWars,"I read somewhere in the Lore of Star Wars that in ancient time, before the use of lightsabers. force users (those who would become jedi) used actual swords and some \[Pacifists\] used a staff. These weapons was entirely imbued with the force.

With this said, could a modern Jedi/Force user have two wooden sticks (For simplicity I'm just gonna call these sticks ""pares"") imbued with the force as his or her weapon. using them like a lightsaber. minus the cutting people and deflecting blaster rounds.

I'm thinking this individual would not kill his/her adversary but instead, disarm him/her and use the force within the pares to knock them unconscious by hitting them in the head. I'm also thinking that s/he could use the pares against blaster rounds but without being able to deflect them back at the one shooting, instead the blaster rounds just dissipates like sparks.",Could a force users saber be a pair of sticks?
StarWars,"This may be an unpopular opinion, based on the previously prevailing views of the prequels, but the politics were one of the good parts of that era. The Prequels were based around the idea of a fall from grace, ostensibly about Darth Vader’s but also about the Republic becoming the Empire.

Compared to the Galactic Civil War and First Order-Resistance War, the Clone Wars felt more like an actual war. Both sides had their reasons for the war, how it happened was explained in detail, and if you get really into it, their were fair points in favor of the Republic and the Confederacy. I see people complain about trade being the cause of the Naboo Crisis in Episode I, but to me that’s one of the most realistic parts of the entire saga. Trade disputes often led to conflict historically, and trade routes to the Outer Rim would definitely be important in the Star Wars galaxy.

The Clone Wars has a subtext of the Human dominated Core vs the alien Periphery, intrigue between political factions as well as Force ideologies. The fact that Leia could follow in the footsteps of both Padmé Amidala and Bail Organa was awesome to me once I saw how they had fought to prevent the Clone Wars and to prevent Palpatine’s growing authoritarianism. 

I enjoyed the sequels, but something I think they lacked, especially with RoS out, was any kind of political motivation for the central conflict. Bloodline did a good job sating some of that thirst, I love the Centrist vs Populist angle, because it evokes that Clone Wars era divide again, but I wish they did more in the films themselves with it. A huge question after Episode IX is “Who controls the galaxy? Is it just anarchy now? Local warlords?”

It might not be everyone’s favorite part of the prequels, but in my view, the politics of the era made it more interesting and enriched the world of Star Wars. I hope future Star Wars content can flesh that out even more.",Politics is what makes the Prequel era interesting
StarWars,"Just got access to Disney+. Watching ep 5 in glorious 4k HDR. Vader's helmet has never shone so brightly, snow speeder scenes are as crisp as anything. 

But so far the real memorable moment is this. In the scene when Leia kisses Luke after arguing with Han, as she pulls away from the kiss, there is a barely visible spit tentacle between the two of them. I'm watching on a 65"" 4K LG C8 OLED but I caught it. Maybe some things are better left in standard definition? Figured I'd share this little discovery as I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else yet.

StarWars,"We all know how Palpatine orchestrated the creation of the Clones from the very beginning to include the inhibitor chips so he could have them turn on the Jedi when the time was right. If he can achieve that level of forced programming with humans, surely it would have been easy to also install something into every Republic Army droid to make them follow Order 66 as well.

But Palpatine isn't concerned about a few Astromech droids. Why would he even bother with such a small thing? And yet those droids saved Ahsoka and Rex and will no doubt be instrumental in their escape in the final episode.

I am the only person who liked Ahsoka at first but now I’ve grown to hate her. 

What originally made Ahsoka so interesting was the fact that she was not seen in the movies making her mortal unlike most other characters. What made her cool was the fact that she adopted traits from obiwan and Anakin she had obiwan’s banter and anakin’s recklessness and hardass bad cop mentality. But mostly her story would always be “You’re a kid and I’m an adult, so I know best, shut up snips” and I was in my teens at the time clone wars came out so I sort of felt for her. But once it became apparent that she is never dying, Anakin and obiwan were gone and she grew up and fully matured all the purpose of this character was gone. 

She leaves the order because they were hypocrites claiming to be good but doing deceitful things, yet she does nothing against the evil. Why did she not help with destroying the Death Star, a planet destroying laser must be okay, I guess? Also, how the hell did, she beat maul, MAUL, c’mon man. Maul was slapping obiwans balls around the whole show. Might I remind you that Obiwan is the guy who defeats the “Chosen One” who is also Darth Vader so how did maul get defeated by a padawan who didn’t even hold a lightsaber for a year (or at least long enough to get a new look). In rebels she defeats people without even using her lightsabers she just thinks and their sabers turn off, pretty ridiculous for someone who hasn’t even finished the standard jedi training. She has devolved into a hypocritical Mary sue. Also, why would Ahsoka sense Anakin’s unspeakable act but Obiwan wouldn’t. 

For my money Anakin should have been forced to watch Ahsoka’s final moments before order 66 this would help his decent into the dark side but also explain why he talks so weirdly and is so possessive of Padme in the movies. Watching your daughter-sister thing die by force lighting would probably fuck you up. Sidious could have killed her in the ‘underneath the jedi temple arc’ and disappear before Anakin could stop him from killing Ahsoka or discover who he is. The story ends with Anakin holding Ahsoka’s lifeless body as the small crack of sunlight surrounding them fades away. 

If they are going to keep her around then she at least needs is a contrast character a “white sith” that does the opposite of Ahsoka. Also, an episode on why does she have an octopus’s butt hole stretched over her head the fat tentacles are gross. I still love the new episodes though",Ahsoka is over-rated

StarWars,"So after my college semester is done I’m planning on watching every single movie and episode (clone wars and rebels) in chronological order listed below (keep reading please!!)

TPM
AOTC
Clone Wars (chronologically)
ROTS
Solo
Rebels
RO
ANH
ESB
ROTJ
Mando
TFA
TLJ
TROS

Now the trouble comes with season 7 of the clone wars and episode 3. I know episodes 9-12 are literally happening at the exact same time as rots, so how should I watch it? Should I watch to the point where anakin and Ashoka separate for the last time then watch rots then go back and finish the episodes? Watch the episodes then the movie? Try to line up the movie and show and play and pause each part?

Maybe I’m thinking too deep on this but I want to hear some feedback.",Important question and I need input
StarWars,"I currently run a Star Wars adaptation for dungeons and dragons fifth edition and it’s likely that my party will be coming across a sith temple in the near future. I’m in the process of making plans for ways of making it difficult to access and traverse the temple, and my main idea for the traversal is to have a series of tests or puzzles each based off of one of the major elements of the sith code, but I’m finding myself at a loss when trying to think of such puzzles, and so I’m reaching out for ideas.",Sith Temple Tests
StarWars,"With the release of the recent Clone Wars episode, many people have begun hating on Mace Windu regarding his seemingly arrogant remarks towards Ahsoka. But, I see that scene, and Mace in an entirely different light following that scene.

Ahsoka is the one to reaffirm her neutrality as a citizen rather than a Jedi, which prefaced his remarks. To Mace, Ahsoka wanted nothing to do with the Jedi, so why would he inform her about their plan to remove the most powerful man in the galaxy from his position? Does Mace seem like a dick, sure, but remember who this man is. Mace Windu is a pragmatic and dedicated individual who has fought a war for three years. He knows the war is coming to a close, and he is faced with the extremely delicate situation of trying to bring peace to a galaxy at war. By telling Ahsoka about their plans, he opens up the possibilities of her attempting to alter them, as she no longer abides by the council or the code. In conclusion, Mace wasn't being an asshole to Ahsoka, he merely wanted to end the war without creating any further complications and if successful, give Ahsoka time to revisit her connection to the Jedi postwar.",In Defense Of Mace
StarWars,"Whenever I see this brought up I cringe internally so hard. It’s like people have completely blotted out what happened with the Franchise and the fan base back in the 2000’s and replaced it with nostalgia glasses. 

After the prequels came out (and especially when TCW movie came out) George Lucas was being burnt on the figurative stake for “ruining Star Wars” until he finally sold the franchise to Disney in 2012. Now in the present day suddenly people are begging for him to come back and “save his vision”? Seriously? The fandom goes round and round in different directions and never knows what it wants. WE, the fans, were the ones who practically forced him out to Disney in the first place guys.

If George Lucas created something on similar quality to the Prequels after hypothetically regaining access to the franchise, it’d be the same story as before, he’d be criticized just as he always has (the recent “MACLUNKEY!” addon to ANH outrage being the biggest example of this) and driven out by us once again. I love the guy and his ideas (they’ve largely inspired my own life) but he’s made some doozies of Star Wars movies and choices in the past. Whether it’s George or Disney at the helm, the result will most likely be the same, the fandom will stay divided. His original idea after all for the overarching narrative of the series was in perspective to the midichlorians (bleh). 

The man does what he wants with the stories he’s made, we’ve seen that with Han shooting second and all the other baffling choices and edits he’s made to all of his entries, it’s clearly not to appease us fans, it’s for him to realize the vision he has of Star Wars. 

Personally, I don’t blame him, it’s his creation, he shouldn’t try to create something he wouldn’t be happy with, he probably honestly believes the changes he made improved the story he made, regardless of the backlash it receives. 

But he can’t “save” Star Wars. That’s up to the new generation of creators. So don’t ask for his return as a messiah figure, because it’s not possible and it wouldn’t ever work out in the end, for us or him.","No, George Lucas could not come and “save” Star Wars today"
StarWars,"So I just got done with a full Star Wars movie marathon. It was fantastic (as you’d expect) but I couldn’t help but feel a little let down. The lore of Star Wars is so complex and so cool, but the prequels felt dry, the originals (though classics and good plots) were a little old, and the sequels (though entertaining movies) could’ve been done in a single movie. So I’m doing what any normal person would do. I’m rewriting the movies. I’ll maintain as many plot points as I can and I plan to leave some portions untouched, but I thought it would be fun to rewrite the entire saga as a fan fiction/ experiment to see if I could make them any better.

One of the main things I’ve been wanting to fix was Anakin’s fall to the dark side. There were a lot of factors that could’ve played into his fall based on the lore. The prequels chose two and sort of half assed it. They went with the power hunger and the padme in danger route. I think there are many other possibilities or improvements.

They could do an inception kind of thing where sidious plants ideas in anakins head until he is consumed by them (sort of the gist they were going for but I think they could make it more convincing.)

They could make Anakin, like sidious, feel that he was better than everyone else and have him confront that but be discovered by sidious.

They could have the Jedi council find out that he was created by sidious and cease all of his training making him hate the Jedi 

They could pull an Ahsoka and have him be framed or somehow shake his faith in the Jedi.

Any of these could work, and likely it would be some small combination. So here’s my question

Which of those do you think sounds the most interesting?",I need your opinion on a rewrite.
StarWars,"The first thing to keep in note is the fact that Rex already knew something about darth sidious because of Ashoka. The moment palpatine popped up, he puts it all together and realizes the whole story.

You can see the small silence palpatine had after issuing the order to Rex, he realized how close he was to failing and saw the anger and realization in Rex’a eyes. He was also probably not expecting to be called darth sidious. He knew there that there were some people who were too close to the truth. (Luckily for him not close enough)

But eventually control took over and Rex became a shell of himself, and then went on to do what you know would happen.",The reason Rex called palpatine “Darth sidious” is actually brilliant.
StarWars,"I would love to see an animated version of revenge of the sith with the new clone wars arc edited into it once the arc finishes. The only difference I would make to any bit of the movie or arc would be to add the line “Save Me” to anakin as he’s burning but wanting obi-wan to save him. Those two words would change the whole dynamic of obi-wan and Vader’s relationship and just elevate it to another level imo. Vader hates obi-wan because he left him to die on mustafar. It would also give us the chance to see more  of the battles on utapau and mustafar. I didn’t feel like we saw a whole bunch of what went on during the mustafar battle due to other things needing screen time. 

I also just want to see the obi-wan battle on utapau and the mustafar battle in CW animation style ngl lol.",How many people would pay to see an animated version of revenge of the sith?
StarWars,"I really don't get it after watching the movie. It feels so weird.   


They have this intricate amazing premise set up of a massive army in waiting along with the original first order and they lost to a few rebels on some animals? Also; shouldn't the massive gathering of sith been able to do something as well? How could they not fight off a small incursion, those were SUPREME STARSHIPS. Like; they were insane. And did the rebellion really kill millions of people that easily? I mean, each one of those ships had to have what, an entire cities worth of people?   


Idk maybe I'm over thinking it; but the end seemed really weird to me.",Can someone explain to me how the First Order even lost?
StarWars,"His name is Darth Torpok and in terms of personality he's a womanising (when it comes to species he's not too fussy) smooth talking combat pragmatist who keeps dangerous animals as pets as they keep him in his feet and is fond of whatever the Star Wars universe's equivalent for cigars are that he usually lights with his lightsaber. He's not as ambitious as other Sith lords as he knows that those who try to rule over whole planets meet with an early grave.

He's accompanied by a cadet in the Sith army called Jicif who he took a liking to when they first met as Jicif made him laugh. Jicif's role is similar to a squire to a medieval knight and since he's not a Sith apprentice trying to kill him there's genuine trust between the two and Jicif is the one person who is allowed to insult Torpok and get away with it (mainly because Torpok simply insults him back). When Jicif falls for the daughter of a general in the Sith army Torpok sends the other rivals for her affection to dangerous battlefields and has those that survive meet with a nasty accident. Torpok is eventually able to secure a reservation for Jicif and the daughter at an excellent restaurant by threatening to kill the owner.

Torpok's story mostly revolves around him often unintentionally helping a lot of people even though his motives are purely in his own interest. His adventures with Jicif include:

* Seducing and sleeping with a ruthless queen which ultimately causes turmoil within her family and ruins her reputation which in turn leads to the ruthless royal family getting overthrown. When leaving he fights and kills the corrupt, power-abusing royal guard as he wants to get some fighting practice done.
* Killing a cruel dictator because he was rude and annoying. Him and Jicif also kills several members of the dictator's secret police because he's in a bad mood and fighting always cheers him up.
* Bringing down a powerful crime lord when another Sith lord bets he can't do it.
* Destroying a giant dangerous out of control prototype war droid before it could destroy a nearby city simply because he was bored and didn't have anything better to do at the moment.
* When him and Jicif crash land on a backwater planet they kill some notorious thieves when they tro to rob them, casually walk into a camp of bandits, sit down at a table and begin eating their food and when some bandits try to stop them Torpok kills them with the force while still eating which gives the other bandits the message not to stop them. When they arrive at a village they're regarded as saviours who are going to help them but they're too tired to object and stay the night. When the village is attacked that night by raiders Torpok kills them simply for disturbing his sleep. A few days later the duo kill some pirates and take their ship but not before Torpok sleeps with a few of the villagers.
* When some jawas are terrorised by a dangerous beast Torpok captures the beast so he can keep it as a pet.

Torpok is aware of how many people he has unintentionally helped and can get annoyed by the gratitude he often receives as he doesn't see himself as a hero but he is willing to exploit his reputation if there is something in it for him (usually either women, alcohol or as I said at the start, the Star Wars equivalent for cigars).

Please let me know what you think and if you have any ideas you can add to Darth Torpok.",My idea for an Old Republic Era Sith Lord
StarWars,"Personally I don’t think they should renew the exclusivity deal with EA but instead allow any studio to pitch their idea for a Star Wars game.

Now I’ll be honest I enjoy battlefront 2 after all the updates and I liked fallen order, however for having the license since 2013 and releasing 2 decent games in 7 years is a bit ridiculous.

EA also thought that this would be a license to print money but that blew up in their face with the lootbox controversy. 

If Disney allowed other publishers to make games alongside EA then we could see a new Star Wars game every year in a range of different genres making some serious cash for Disney.

Hopefully when the time comes Disney consider this option and allow more than just EA to use the Star Wars brand, even with games like maverick and fallen order 2 in apparent development this would not hinder either of those games dev time.",What do you think Disney should do when their contract with EA runs out in 2023?
StarWars,"Everything being set in stone has always kinda put a damper on Star Wars for me. It bleeds into almost every aspect of the series.


New cool Jedi character? Why isn't he helping our protagonist in X movie? There always needs to be a reason written for why these character avoid being in the movies/shows or else it starts to unravel. It creates this feeling of you know what is going to happen to this character as soon as they appear on the screen. They'll either be killed or somehow removed from the spotlight for plot reasons.

Nothing crazy will happen because we know Ashoka is in the Mandalorian and Maul will be in Rebels. Rex will get his chip removed and be in Rebels(and ROTJ I think? I forgot how that panned out).

It would be so refreshing to follow new characters, away from all the predetermined outcomes. It allows for betrayal, death, and uncertainty we cant get in the Skywalker series. 

These are just my thoughts on something thats always bothered me. Im not saying there needs to be the threat of dying for there to be suspense, the latest episode of clone wars proves that, but just uncertainty in general is nice and fun to have every once in awhile.",They need to get away from the Skywalker saga to have a sense of uncertainty in the series for once.

I’ve seen a few s4 episodes, a couple s5 episodes, and then the last 3 episodes of s7. I want to watch all the really good episodes of it before next weeks finale is out. I plan on watching all of s7 before then, but aside from that, what are some essential episodes for me to watch so I can appreciate what’s happening even more? I personally thought the last 3 episodes have been better than even some of the movies (all of the sequels especially), but I want to be able to appreciate them even more.

StarWars,"Whenever I watch star wars videos I see people often say that RotJ was the least good of the original trilogy and most flawed but I really don’t get why. To me personally it’s probably my favorite of the originals with Empire being really close. Honestly ANH is my least favorite of the originals. I just feel RotJ was much more emotional and impactful than ANH which makes sense since it’s the third movie. Luke just felt a lot more interesting and showed how far he has come from that plucky young adventurer in ANH. We see him go into some morally questionable actions specifically the force choking the guards at Jabba’s palace and how he has kind of turned on his masters for lying to him which was leading him down a darker path. The theme of it was essentially like Anakin in RotS is essentially the road to hell is paved with good intentions that being to save his father. Not to mention his interactions with Vader was amazing

The biggest issues I hear people bring about it are that it refuses the Death Star, the Ewoks (though this has died out) and the plan to save Han was kind of stupid. Eh i understand these complaints but to me the positives vastly outweigh the negatives and feel the criticisms just don’t weigh down the best parts which to me are some of the best parts in the entire OT (Luke and Vader interactions, their fight, the Emperor, Jabba’s palace and barge etc)",Why do people say RotJ is the least good of the original trilogy?
StarWars,"So I just played the two games for the first time since they came out using PS Now and I have some... statements. Now I’ve heard that the story in the first one is really good but I was pretty let down. I like the premise a lot but I don’t really see the turn in the characters. Like one minute they go from the empire to the next moment they’re good. I get the whole “go form the rebellion thing” (even though that’s pretty dumb in of itself) but I didn’t get the feeling of StarKiller ever really having a gradual move to the light side. Just kinda felt like an immediate switch. 

Now the gameplay in the first game was incredible. I loved the saber duels at the end of levels and really felt powerful cutting my way through troops. 

The second game however was the biggest disappointment I’ve had in a while. I was shocked by the dismemberment which was great but the game felt either incredibly easy or incredibly frustrating at times. There were no saber boss fights besides Vader’s lame one at the end which was just throw these things back at me then fight my minions repeat x5. 

The story also managed to be even worse than the original. What little there was to the characters was completely gone now and all that was left was “much gotta save Juno” despite of the whole point of the ending to the first game was sacrificing himself for the rebellion. 

Basically if you are looking at playing these games either for the first time or the first time in a while (on PC, PS Now, and Xbox backwards compatibility), end it on the first one. As a bonus the first game has some really excellent dark side ending dlc.",Force Unleashed.
StarWars,"What if the movie started with Rey been captured by snoke (basically it starts on the third act, but a lot changes, like instead of being right after ep 7 it takes place like 1 or 2 years later.

Rey has been training with Luke but after a distress call by the resistance Rey chooses to help the resistance but she's captured by the first order on her way.
Cut to a torn Kylo perhaps haunted by anakins force ghost or nightmares of Han's death has lead him to kill snoke (leading to the throne fight but this time it's at the beggining) after the fight everything on crait happens but no Luke, instead it's a chase, and the resistance barely escapes from the first order.",Alternate start for episode 8 and essentially the whole film
StarWars,"Without Fives it's reasonable to assume Ahsoka isn't able to turn Rex and does not escape. We will learn more next episode, so this may all be wrong if it looks like she could have escaped without Rex. But if we assume she gets killed if Rex does not turn then she never helps the Rebellion. Without Ahsoka Vader gets the Holocron. Without Ahsoka who knows what happens with the rebellion as she was incredibly valuable to them. The only Jedi Fives was able to save may have been the reason the rebellion survived. I know it's far from a guarantee, but I don't think its improbable to assume Ahsoka dies without his hologram warning and without Ahsoka the rebellion dies. Did Fives's sacrifice end up toppling the Empire?",Fives did NOT die in vain. In fact he saved the galaxy
StarWars,"Since I saw Star Wars for the first time when I was 5 years old, I’ve been in love. I’ve been a fan, own all the movies, grew up with posters on my wall, toys, a bed set, clothes, Darth Vader masks and toy lightsabers. In the 15 years since I saw it for the first time my love has never died. 

On the internet though, sharing your opinions with other fans is terrible. Star Wars elitists are the most obnoxious people on earth. On any post someone makes about the newer 3 films, you have bombardment of people saying “those aren’t canon. you shouldn’t watch this because it isn’t canon. star wars sucks because it has girls who are strong and aren’t chained up in their underwear next to a slug” 

It really is annoying to constantly see elitism and gatekeeping in this fandom. Disney makes a post on instagram saying you can soon watch all 9 movies on their platform, and what is the comment section filled with? “why would i wanna watch the last three?” “the last three arent canon” “i’ll only be watching the first six since they don’t have rey” “the original trilogy is the only one you should watch” and all of these comments have thousands or hundreds of likes. we get it. YOU don’t like it. YOU aren’t the decider for everyone else. 

It is a think in this fandom and many others that turn away new members from joining because they’ve only seen the newer three and when they say it it’s like their opinion is invalidated because they don’t agree with them. I seriously hate this fandom, i’ve never been able to attach myself to it because it is filled with elitism and “oh you don’t know who this guy is because you didn’t read issue number 6 of this comic telling an obsolete storyline for the expanded universe, fake fan” 

All in all I love star wars but this fandom keeps me away from making friends because most are rude. I like all 9 films, and the amount of times i’ve been belittled or reacted to as lesser than because i like something out of the norm is astounding. i really hope it changes and people can see that everyone has different opinions. if it isn’t canon, who cares. is the expanded universe not considered non canon too, yet everyone loves it. I agree the new movies have lots of flaws, but it’s more on story telling than on having a female leader or a female lead.",This fan base is really atrocious.
StarWars,"I have not started the final season of Clone Wars yet, I'm waiting for the season to be complete before I start so i can binge so please no spoilers in the comments. I have the Ahsoka novel and Son of Dathomir comic series on my reading lists, and was also waiting until clone wars was finished before I dove into those. Having said all of that, would i need to do all 3? Based on whats happened so far in season 7, how much new info would I gain from the novel or comics? I would probably read Son of Dathomir either way because I like how easy to digest comics are and the art style but should i/do i need to read Ahsoka too in order to get the full picture? Also, am I saving everything in the right order, should I read the novel/comics before watching season 7? Help me r/StarWars, you're my only hope!


Tl;Dr waiting to start CW season 7 until its over to binge, once I watch season 7 do I still need to read Ahsoka novel and Son of Dathomir comics????",Clone Wars final season vs Ahsoka vs Som Of Dathomir (No Spoilers)
StarWars,"Obvious hyperbole, I don't actually think these are the biggest mistakes of star wars, but it's a progression of two things I noticed that just kind of bother me about how certain characters are handled throughout canon.

The two main examples of this are Boba Fett and Darth Maul.

It's no surprise that at a glance, both villains are ultimate badasses... Excellent visual story-telling and lots of intrigue associated with them. They are silent, but always shown being very observant - basically waiting for their master to sic them on one of the heroes with a ""you'll get your turn"" sort of look to them.

But oh my god were these villains handled poorly in the movies. To the point that these are some of the biggest let-downs in the entire series. Boba Fett getting hit in the back by a blinded Han Solo causing him to smack into the side of Jabba's sail barge and fall into the Pit of Carkoon. All in a matter of like 10 seconds. Maul dies in a cooler way and leads to a pretty emotional scene after he kills Qui Gon in front of young Obi-Wan Kenobi only to be killed off seconds later, denying what could have been a spanning nemesis for Obi-Wan throughout the series.

Now, I know what you're about to say, so before you say it: yes both Boba Fett and Maul actually survive these encounters. But not really. It's incredibly obvious that they were killed in these scenes and everything after like Darth Maul in Clone Wars and Rebels is just trying to correct the mistake of off-ing them in the first place.

But anyways, this leads me to what I think is the second biggest mistake in all of star wars: too much of a good thing.

After realizing that characters like Boba Fett and Darth Maul were popular with fans and going: ""oh.. maybe we shouldn't have killed them off so fast, let's bring them back"" they double down and show wayyyy too much of both of them. 

With Maul making tons of appearances in Clone Wars and Rebels having a personal battle with Ahsoka, appearing in Solo as what seems to be a level above the main villain of the movie... I think it's undoing the exact thing that made him great: the mystery. Same with Boba Fett, though its mostly just ruining the mystique of the Mandalorians as a whole... we're told they are these rare and mysterious warriors, but it feels like every other character introduced is a fucking Mandalorian: like *the* Mandalorian (Mando i.e. Dyn Djarin), Sabine Wren, the whole Mandalore plotline in Clone Wars.

So at the end of the day. I think it's good that they are receiving more fulfilling conclusions than the movies provided, but in the process, I think how some have handled it have ruined the entirety of what made them great. That being said, these are just my opinions. I'm not trying to attack yours, so if you disagree, I'm perfectly fine with that.

TL;DR: its one thing when a cool and mysterious villain is handled poorly like Boba Fett and Maul, but then it gets worse when what's left that makes them great (being cool and mysterious) is ruined by being overused.",One of the biggest mistakes in star wars followed by the second biggest mistake
StarWars,"I got this idea after watching the new episode today

What if there was a first person shooter game set in the Clone Wars where you play as a Clone Commander. You start out on the battle of Geonosis. Eventually you're assigned to a Jedi general. The Jedi would be an original character. You grow to love your Jedi general. Eventually you're in phase two armor. You fight a battle on this planet then that planet then in the middle of some mission on some planet you get a message from the Chancellor. Now all of a sudden you have to hunt down this Jedi General that you grow to love over the game. Itd be like the original BF2 campaign but with original characters and you have no idea when 66 is coming. Theres no clues besides maybe some subtle hints. But the game is meant to be played from the clones' perspective where it just happens out of nowhere and you are compelled to obey it.",Idea for a Star Wars game
StarWars,I just feel like there could be so much interesting backstory provided to add context which furthers emotional stakes that weren’t really there in the films. Seeing Ahsoka just sensing Anakins turn was absolutely brilliant. Even with only a voiceover I was devastated. Some possible storylines for the Sequel wars could be kylos training or Finn doing something useful like his friendship developing with Poe while gaining victories for their side. Would love to hear some more possible ideas in the comments.,Someone should make a Clone Wars style show set during the Sequel Trilogy
StarWars,"Mace is HORRIBLE. 

He is constantly rude and dismissive to Aniken though he knows he is the chosen one, only because he believes he was allowed into the order though Mace votes against it. Sure he says Aniken struggles with anger and confusion but we have seen so many Jedi deal with that too. He is just bitter he didn’t get his way. By extension he treats Ahsoka like shit too.

He is also a full warmonger. He has no interest in the peaceful route. Rather than take Jango in for questioning like the council had asked Obi Wan to do, Mace just straight beheads him. He even tells Boba later to just get over it. He has no compassion which is one of the basics of the order.

His entire life revolves around the stringent Jedi code and rules of the temple. He is essentially a Zealot who rejects any who do not follow his own path. I can think of so many other reasons he is a horrible Jedi. Everything about him is what is wrong with the Jedi order and allowed Sidious to rise. I think that makes him an interesting character but a terrible Jedi. I always see people talking about how he is their fav Jedi and I have to assume it’s because he has a fan favorite actor and a cool lightsaber colour because for the life of my I don’t know why else.",Mace Windu is one of the worst Jedi we have ever seen and people only like him because of his purple lightsaber.
StarWars,"Hey everyone so I’m showing my gf the ENTIRE Star Wars saga from beginning to end starting with episode 1 - 9 with EVERYTHING in between that is important, with that being said we’ve watched episode 1 and 2 and before 3 I want to watch a few episodes of the clone wars, can someone give me a link or their advice of the important episodes without the fillers that to her would be pointless, I for one have watched season 1-6 twice and currently on season 7 but I know watching 120 some odd episodes could be tiresome for someone who isn’t as much of a fan as us so any advice would be great 😁",Clone wars order?
StarWars,"star wars has literally always had strong, empowering and inspiring females. Right from 1977 we had Leia and Mon Mothma, both super independent women who inspire others. They all have wonderful arcs. In the prequels, we obviously have Ahsoka (have you ever heard anyone say I don't like Ahsoka) who we grew with, her story, her arcs, her character all brilliant, that's why she is one of the most loved characters in star wars to date. Then there's Padme, a woman who's independent, can fight for herself and most importantly fights for what is right. We have so many string Jedi, aayla secura, aadi galya, luminara unduli, bariss offee. If you want badass women who rule over others, we have asajj ventress (her arc is one the best), aurra sing, bo katan. There are so many leaders, padme, satine, tu chi. Then we have Sabine wren later. Women have always been there in star wars and the fans have never been against it. Kathleen Kennedy wanted another woman character, yes we need more of course. But due to her sheer lack of creativity, stubbornness to look into older stories and hunger for control (there's this quote in clone wars, ""one who seeks control, shall never find peace."") she created this ""perfect"" Disney princess who had no flaws and was extremely bland. No one can relate to someone like that, therefore the backlash. Rey has no plot or personally and overall I think she has done the worse for the future of women. The prequels did have real world politics, but it was part of the plot. Here the plot is part of the politics...",The women backlash from the point of view of a woman
StarWars,"Look, high republic could be total garbage, but people are stating it like it’s a fact right now. I’m going to wait till I read some of its content before making that decision. I wonder if any of them have even read a canon novel/comic. Cause every complaint is comparing it to the sequel trilogy. These are completely different departments with different people. Fallen Order had its own crew, Mandalorian had its own crew. The haters also say they should have just done the old republic, but I feel like they would still complain saying they are ruining it or should do something new. The rest of the haters are just yelling sjw. Look, I hate sjws just as much as the next guy, but the only thing that annoys me as much as sjws, are anti sjws. If the high republic ends up being a let down, I’ll be the first to admit it. But I have faith because out of all the new canon novels, there were only three I didn’t like. Pretty good track record.",Why are people trashing High Republic before it’s even out?
StarWars,"(Originally posted on r/PrequelMemes)

There's some amazing continuity in filmmaking going on in Clone Wars s7 e11.

In the original hologram conference in ROTS, the scene ends with a symmetrical horizontal wipe cut over Yoda's face (01:01:53). 

*Processing video nug8pujas6w41...*

In this episode, the scene continues and immediately Ahsoka enters (00:02:57). The transition is marked by an in-frame effect very similar to the wipe cut. Behind Mace Windu's face, you can see the doors opening in a horizontal motion which reverses the wipe cut from ROTS.

The wipe cut in ROTS reveals Palpatine; the doors in this episode reveal Ahsoka.

StarWars,"Show us his birth and training on Kamino, and how he got his name and how he rose through the ranks to become Captain. 

Show us his POV throughout the Clone Wars, and how the war changed him and his comrades. 

Show us how he found Wolfe and Gregor after Order 66, and how he removed their inhibitor chips, and what they did after going into hiding. 

Show us his perspective during Rebels, and what he did after he joined the Rebel Alliance. I don’t know how feasible this is, but I think it’d be cool for him and Wolfe to find out if any other clones disobeyed Order 66. 

Show us him watching Luke’s medal after “A New Hope”, and he hears someone mention his name is Skywalker. Have him meet Luke later, and have him talk about Anakin and Ahsoka and his experiences during the Clone Wars. These stories would only strengthen Luke’s faith in his father, and Rex playing a small part in Anakin’s redemption would be absolutely perfect. 

Show us him during different campaigns between “A New Hope” and “Return of the Jedi”. 

Show us his perspective during the battle of Endor, and watching the destruction of the second Death Star. Have him attend Anakin’s funeral with Luke, and they’d reminisce about their experiences. 

Show us him being rewarded with retirement, and have him watch as Luke and Ahsoka build the new Jedi Order.",You know what I’d like after season 7 of The Clone Wars is finished? A comic book arc that examines the complete life of Captain Rex.

After Ben has his conversation with Han, throws his lightsaber into the water, and is fully embracing the light side, it would have been neat for him to turn around and Anakin be there finally revealing himself to his grandson. He doesn’t say anything, but points back towards the Death Star throne room remains. Ben finds a pile of wreckage in the throne room and in it is Darth Vader’s lightsaber. Ben picks up the hilt and Anakin appears in front of him and says “You under estimate YOUR power”.

StarWars,"It seems very odd considering from gameplay they have the same power scaling. The strongest enemy  outside of bosses either encounter are ATSTs and both display the same power to destroy them. I think the part where people overhype Starkiller is the famous Star Destroyer scene and him beating Vader despite both of these working extremely well within the Star Wars universe.

Starkiller has many huge things working for him that has given him his crazy force powers as a child and that's the fact that he was born from two Jedi lovers who left the Order to be together to raise their child. Just look at how powerful the Skywalker twins are from being born of Anakin, The Shan family from being born of Revan and Bastila or Rey's strength from being born of Palpatine, someone born of two masters will obviously have high force powers. Starkiller also spent 10 years being subjected to the most brutal training Vader could think up, and giving him the most pure and unfiltered Sith training probably ever done due to how the rule of two works. There are alot of lore represented reasons as to why he was so powerful, Cal is powerful because of his OP PLS NERF ability to literally take not only force power but skills from objects with strong force connections to them. To give you an example of stupid op that, if Cal touches the Skywalker lightsaber he gains all of Anakin's skills at the height of the Clone Wars, instantly mastering all forms of lightsaber combat and likely absorbing a large chunk of the force within the weapon. That's OP, that power has no cap, so if he does the same with anything such as sniffing Palpatine's robes, he'll get he same affect. If Cal were to ever just go to The Valley of the Sith Lords and JUST TOUCH SHIT, he'd become a god. How do people not see that as OP but think Rey or Starkiller is? That isn't a trained ability that is just something he has a birth, he just got an insane dice roll and is living it up. What reason does Cal even have to run form Darth Vader when all he has to do is touch his lightsaber once and know everything in his bag of tricks. He's absurdly op and yet this is fine to people but not Starkiller. BTW I want to point to that Vader has an insane power scaling moment in Fallen order, he uses the force to hold back an entire ocean, that's power and also works within the Star Wars lore.

Okay so let's talk about Star Killers feats. As I said before he and Cal both show the ability to destroy AT ST, and they both know how to fight powerful force users. To address the Star Destroyer scene all I have to do is point you to Yoda. As Yoda makes it very clear, size doesn't many anything to the force, if you have the will to do, then you will unless you're being acted upon by another. Even if you refuse to accept the words of the Grand Jedi Master then the simple fact that he didn't bring down the Star Destroyer should suffice because the Star Destroyer was already going down, he just made it go down faster and prevented it from crushing him...mostly. If you have an issue with him bringing down a Star Destroyer, saying that's impossible then take that shit up with Luke Skywalker who during the battle of Jakku was destroying ENTIRE FLEETS with the force. Slamming Star Destroyers into each like he was  making a giant metal imperial sandwich. It's well within lore and even so preached by the grand master that this power is well within the force to be done. Well how did he defeat Vader, simple lightning. Vader's suit is specifically designed by Palpatine to be weak to lightning in the old lore and Starkiller specializes in force lightning so much that he invented his own ability called Lightning Shield. Now tell me, what the mynock ass is Vader going to do against an ability called lightning shield? Die, he's going to die. On top of that Vader was significantly weaker then Anakin, it wasn't until the retcon did Disney actually make him more powerful then Anakin. While I dislike this change it is a lore reason that people forget as to why Vader isn't pulling off the same feats as Anakin.

I understand the idea that Starkiller is OP but if you think he's too strong then you have to atleast acknowledge that Cal has the ability to insanely powerful scale. While Starkiller was nothing short of a force giant Cal could easily surpass Luke in his might given enough time. Not because he's better trained, but simply because when he rolled a D20 he landed on 36.",I find it weird that people think Starkiller is OP but think Cal Kestis is totally fine.
StarWars," Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it. When the episode ended my first thought was: is that all? Sure, we got to see order 66 from Ahsoka's and Rex's perspective, but I think this episode could have been much more. I wanted to see more Maul instead of just one Rogue One Vader hall scene and something to happen that we don't know already. We only have one episode left, so I expected much more action. Now I hope the last episode will be a bit longer with more action.

I'll probably get downvoted for this but this is what I think. Or it might be just because I watched it after episode 10 that is in my opinion the greatest episode in the entire show.",Opinion on episode 11 TCW (SPOILERS)

Ben Solo was an edge Lord of the sequel trilogy, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the plot to create a cliché ending… He had such a knowledge of the script that he could even change Rey's parentage between movies. ""The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" said Palpatine in his only memorable line in episode 9. He had so much plot armour… the only thing he could do was give up his life energy to satisfy Reylo shippers. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",A tragedy indeed.
StarWars,"TLDR: This is some good ass television my god

I've been a fan of Star Wars since around the period leading up to the release of the Force Awakens, when my Dad introduced me to the original trilogy so that I'd be all caught up. Safe to say I loved them all and loved the movie when it came out, but I'll try to leave my opinions on the sequels out of this. Point is Star Wars has not always been a part of my life like so many other fans, and I'm still relatively new to the universe even 5 years later.

My Dad on the other hand has been a huge fan all his life after watching Star Wars in cinema back in '77, and is in the large majority of older fans who despised most of what the prequels were. Skip forward to this February when the new season of Clone Wars is released and I decide to watch the first 'Bad Batch' episode despite having only seen a few episodes prior when the show was still on Netflix. I was in love, and to my surprise so was my Dad.

Since then I've been watching every single episode in chronological order, and I have almost nothing but praise for this fantastic show. Everyone seems to feel Season 1 is the weakest and while I found this to be the case, I still really enjoyed arcs like Ryloth and even the Malevolence episodes. It's been a blast watching the show grow and develop in both maturity and technical quality - having just finished Umbara my mind was blown at how far this show has come. Even Dad has occasionally watched episodes, and despite his bizarre disdain for Obi-Wan he was been really enjoying the world building and connections to the OT (Tarkin in Season 3 was a big hit). I find this interesting above all because we both found Rebels far too whimsical in tone to be taken seriously, a shame given it set in my personal favourite era of a galaxy far, far away. Compare this to the brutal, sometimes devastating plotlines in TCW and it's a breath of fresh air.

If you've read this far, thank you. I've just had a lot of praise for this show for a little while now and wanted to get it out in a community that I hope will appreciate it. As I said, I've only just finished the Umbara arc (mid season 4) so please no spoilers if you want to reply. Can't wait for all the good that is too come!

StarWars,"In The Rise of Skywalker we see Rey apparently defeat the last Sith (palps) and the thousands of Sith before him, but what does Rey do after this? Will she go on to create a new Jedi order and possibly recruit kids like the one in The Last Jedi? If this happens won’t the Sith/Dark side just rise again to balance the force and thus resume the fighting? The only way to possibly stop this inevitable fight is for Rey to cut herself off from the force and let the Jedi die as well and let the force die in the galaxy which I don’t see her doing.

StarWars,"Why the hell would he just assume that? The only reason Mace Windu was going to execute Palpatine was because he was a Sith Lord. And in that moment, Mace Windu decided to execute him on his own. There's no way a Jedi like Yoda, or most other Jedi, would make that call. The only evidence remotely close to making the argument they would kill the senators is when the Jedi talk about MAYBE taking control of the Republic until they figure things out. But even Yoda doesn't really agree that that's the way it should go down. I just don't get why he would assume that the Jedi would go around massacring a bunch of politicians. Also, does Anakin not realize that Palpatine literally constructed the whole war? Sidious even tells him where the Separatists are and the Separatists tell Anakin that Sidious told them he was coming. Orchestrating an entire war seems like a very evil thing to do. So why can't Anakin see Sidious and the Sith really are evil?",Why would Anakin believe the Jedi were about the kill all the senators?
StarWars,"Yeah, this sounds childish. I have a really bad viewpoint on drugs, and you cannot blame me for it as I have seen the most healthy become destroyed by them. It even created a fear of them for me. For example, I thought that if I had an idol that suddenly used drugs, I would start to dislike them and forget them. I’ve always loved Star Wars, it’s been a thing I can connect to and just enjoy by playing games, watching the films, listening to the music.. Carrie’s death of course saddened me when I heard it in 2016. I read that it was because of a heart problem, but recently found out that Carrie using drugs sometimes as a method of calming down and use it as an escape. At first I was kinda shocked, but so many actors have recovered from that so it is not the biggest surprise, but it did sadden me, but oh well, it happened. I’ve always disliked drug addicts. But today that viewpoint has changed, I’d rather support them these days as usually it’s something that turns into a bad habit and destroys health. Don’t get me wrong, it sucks to see drug addicts, but now I actually sympathize with them being victims of it. Carrie did go into rehab but relapsed. At one point she was living a ‘normal life’. She was also diagnosed as bipolar. I never took and never will take drugs, I’ve seen how it’s killed off people. But I can relate to Carrie in the bipolar sense. I was hit with mental health issues a couple of years ago and it was a long road to happiness. When I read that she took drugs I wanted to stop liking Star Wars. It sounds stupid, but then I realized she was just of many unfortunate victims. Carrie’s parents got divorced when she was 17, and she had just a couple of years later risen into stardom. I think to deal with all that pressure she used those drugs. 
Despite Carrie dying in an unfortunate way, she was an inspiration to many, and all of this made me realize the contrary of  hat I thought I would say after reading this: that she was a true icon and I gained a lot more respect to her after reading all of this.","After finding out that Carrie struggled with Bipolar Disorder and Addiction, I gained ever more respect towards her."

-The OT spawned additional content like no other. Books, games, comics, toys, you name it 

-The Prequels were flawed, but the storyline gave us spin-offs like the Clone wars and memorable characters like Ashoka, Maul, Rex and a fleshed out Anakin and Obi-Wan. Tons of toys and costumes sold.

The sequels...too early to tell. My biased opinion is that we won’t see that much content. World-building was missing, story incoherent and weak, and the characters were not so memorable or interesting besides Kylo (deceased) Who will dress up as Rey or Finn 3 years from now? Who will buy Rose toys? (Not counting Palpatine as he was established and brought back for $$$)

What say you? Will the sequels spawn content in the future like the previous trilogies? Or will SW just move to the Old republic and the mandalorian, as well as keeping up the Prequel/OT, while the sequels fade away?","Will the sequels spawn content, or will they be forgettable?"
StarWars,"Please don't judge me for this but ...
I never saw Star Wars til recently. I tried to get through it a few years ago and fell asleep. Finally tried it again and got through all the movies (except the new one and side ones) and I'm almost fully caught up on clone wars now. Wasn't looking forward to watching clone wars, but my boyfriend convinced me, and that sold me on ALL of it. We're watching Rebels next. But I know there's a ton of books and comics out there. I was wondering which ones would be a good place to start and especially which ones are Canon?

Trust me. I've seen the error of my ways. I adore Star Wars. R2D2 is my favorite. And Rex from CW is my baby. So please don't judge me lol. Just looking for recommendations from all the true fans out there. Thanks in advance! 😊",What books out there are Canon?
StarWars,"Characters like Darth Vader and Chewbacca were easy to collect because there was only one version of them. Others like Luke, Han, and Leia were harder to collect, because of all of the different versions of them. My mom wouldn't let me have different versions of the same character, and I wasn't fond of the idea, either, so I had to decide on which version I wanted, and I always had a hard time deciding. 

Did I want Tatooine Luke, Pilot Luke, Dagobah Luke, or full Jedi Luke? It drove me nuts. Did anybody else have this issue?",A problem I had with collecting Star Wars action figures as a kid
StarWars,"I think this most recent episode solidified Ahsoka as the future face of Star Wars. It’s becoming pretty obvious that future SW content won’t be playing into the sequel trilogy characters. I think The Mandalorian and it’s main cast are going to be more prominently displayed in the canon. I’ve been asking myself this over and over since The Rise of Skywalker. What’s next? 

I think the best choice would be to have Djarin, baby Yoda, and Ahsoka spearhead the franchise from here. I think Disney will try and start a cinematic universe from this, much like the marvel one. And this will most likely be the start of it. We already have content being bridged over different Star Wars eras through Ahsoka. She brings the knowledge of both the failures of the Jedi order, as well as the wisdom from a lifetime of tragedy. If she could I part this knowledge on baby Yoda, then this franchise has a future story built up already. 

Of course this is all rampant speculation. But I think the groundwork for a cinematic universe surrounding Ahsoka, Djarin, and Baby Yoda is already there.",The new face of Star Wars
StarWars,"Already seeing discussion of the line in Rebels where Rex says he didn’t betray his Jedi is now false or referring to Anakin, I don’t think so.

The line still refers to Ahsoka, for one he wasn’t with Anakin so it’s not an active choice not attacking him &amp; second Anakin was exempt from Order 66.  

Rex definitely considers Ahsoka his Jedi too, he fought Order 66 and didn’t purposely choose to fire on her. When he was given his free will back he made a choice to protect her and not betray her, fighting his own brothers to save her life. It still fits, if a little messy. 

We will see this further in the next episode.",TCW S7E11 SPOILER - The line from Rebels still makes sense
StarWars,"After a tume of thinking about this I just want more... and I know I shouldn't because this is tue end of Clone Wars. It must end in a cohesive beautiful way that is according to the creators, not the company or it's fans.

But just. It's not fair! They're holding us back! There should have already been many more seasons. The initial vision for the series is already lost, while only the finaly is alowed to exist.

They were already working on Season 7 before they were canceled, right? Some of the season is out on youtube for the public to see (despite not being complete). This highly suggests that Season 6 was completed but simply not aired. Well. I say fuck it why not release that footage if it exists? Why let it sit and collect dust only to be ""discovered"" a hundred years from now by some archeologist? I'm not sure if it is a twitter thing or a Snapgram thing but here goes: #releaseseason6!",I think the rest of CW season 6 should be aloud to air

A tall, black cloaked, sword wielding villain? Check.  
Ewoks? Well no. But a troupe of valiant acrobatic dwarfs? Check.  
Jedi mind tricks? Hoo boy check.  

Ok, it's a bit of a stretch I admit. Certainly not an overt inspiration. But anyone with a love for Star Wars will certainly notice the Darth Vader helmet haircut on the advisor in the king's court, and Luke's Tattooine outfit during the climactic lightsaber... er sword fight scene.  
Whatever the case, an excellent movie for Star Wars fans to look for references in.","I recently watched the 1955 movie/musical ""The Court Jester"" starring Danny Kaye, and saw Star Wars all over it."
StarWars,"Hey Y'all.   So I just got into Star Wars,  as a kid I had seen the movies but didnt get into the lore or really sit down in watch the movies (I watched mostly for the action).    Anyways with quarantine being a thing I've wanted to get into the star wars universe.   To keep things simple I wanted to watch, and read, everything considered ""Canon"" by disney or current Lucasfilm.    I want to read and watch it chronologically including the TV shows.      Does anybody have a list to follow that hits all the points?     I would like to stick to base story stuff before venturing into the EU.

Thanks!",How to: Starwars
StarWars,"With the new episode of Clone Wars I got to thinking and Rex really went through the worst trauma during order 66.

Obi-Wan watched all of his friends die and someone that was like a brother to him turn to darkness.

Yoda was forced to live with the fact that he let down the Jedi and felt that he was the reason for all this.

While these two are often thought of the people who suffered most during order 66, Rex went through so much more. After watching countless brothers fall during the war, now he realizes it was all for nothing. After this, he turns on one of the people he’s closest to and tries to fight it as best he can, but still ends up trying to kill her. Finally, he’s forced to kill his own brothers, who are helpless in this situation. Rex has been through so much trauma in about an hour it’s awful.",Rex suffered more than anyone else from the events of order 66.
StarWars,"The Mandalorian is complete garbage because it removes the feeling of mystery from Yoda during the original trilogy and the prequels. In the prequels I know Yaddle existed but she was not shown much which still made yoda feel special but now baby yoda is ruining what George Lucas intended to do to make yoda special. Also all the people who treat baby yoda like the second coming of Jesus Christ need to shut up he just a ploy to make Disney a lot of money. Also the Porgs suck too and were made to make merchandise that makes Disney money.
Now roast me in the comments:)",The Mandalorian is garbage
StarWars,"We know Ahsoka survived through the end of the Galactic Civil War and then joined Sabine to search for Ezra.     
My crazy fantasy theory is that Ahsoka somehow met up with Luke in between ESB &amp; ROTJ and helped enhance Luke’s Jedi training, perhaps even showing him how to build his own lightsaber.    
She also could not go with Luke to confront Vader &amp; the Emperor, because she tells him “the last time I confronted your father, I hesitated, and it almost cost me my life. I know that my old master is still in there, deep down, but will take a Jedi to bring him back. I am no Jedi.”      
Once Luke almost kills Vader but refuses to strike him down, Palpatine does his thing with the force lightning. While Vader is just standing there watching the Emperor kill Luke, he hears the faintest of voices in his head, it’s Ahsoka,      
re-connecting to her old master through The Force. She pleads with Anakin to save his son, to return to the hero, the good man that she once knew. This telepathic pleading finally gets through to Anakin, and it serves as a tipping point to snap him out of his Dark Side trance, to realize what is happening right before his eyes.",Headcanon: Ahsoka is the reason Anakin returned and saved Luke from Palpatine
StarWars,"When I started watching the clone wars, I simply didn't care about Ahsoka. I didn't, hate her like alot of people did, she was just, fine.

As the show progressed and, her writing and development continued, I like knew she grew into a good, likable character who's very, very well written... but she just didn't click with me. When she had co episodes with Anakin, I was ready for Anakin to be back on screen. When she had episodes with Rex, I was more drawn to Rex. 

By the time she was expelled from the order, I did, ""LIKE"" her, and I really wanted to love her. I knew how popular she was, and how amazingly written and acted, but, I just didn't really love her at all. Then, S7x09 released. And, seeing her reunite with Anakin made me tear up. I don't know what changed, but I absolutely love Ahsoka now. It's just, insane how well done this ""kids cartoon"" is. Its just fucking awesome",My Opinion On Ahsoka
StarWars,"I'm sure this has been discussed before but after all these years Anakin's last moments as a Jedi still don't make sense to me. He wants Palpatine alive to save Padme, so he cuts off Mace's hand to save Palps. Then Palps kills Mace and Anakin is apparently overwhelmed with guilt. I know he's desperate at that point but the next viable step is pledging himself to Palpatine? And immediately setting off to murder hundreds of younglings? This makes absolutely no sense. He knows that he'd lose Padme forever by doing this, even if he manages to prevent her foreshadowed death. It is also out of character. In the clone wars and episodes 1 and 2 Anakin is portrayed as impetuous and capable of killing in righteous rage (sand people) but also intelligent, dignified, caring and loyal to his friends. It doesn't make sense for Anakin to be so utterly stupid and chose to be a cold blooded killer. What he should have attempted to do is  defeat Palapatine, take him prisoner as he originally wanted to, and then coerce him into revealing Plaguis's secret to saving people from death. I think this was just bad writing by George Lucas. Unfortunately this is what we are stuck with. Anakin's fall to the dark side deserved a better story.",I still don't understand Anakin's actions
StarWars,"So I was looking at some old Reddit threads and noticed several people complain that The Phantom Menace cut a majority of Darth Maul's dialogue. Now, I personally am fine with his character lacking dialogue in the final film because it added mysteriousness to the Sith and created an interesting duality with Palpatine (Palpatine was the brain, Maul was the brawn). However, what was George Lucas's reasoning for cutting Maul's dialogue? I can't find any interviews where he discusses this &amp; most of the old threads just used this as fuel to trash George rather than delve into his reasons for this decision.",Why was Darth Maul's dialogue cut from Episode 1?
StarWars,"I’ve been rewatching the entire TCW series front to back in anticipation for the new episode tomorrow, and I came up with a theory of how Ahsoka and Rex survived Order 66 - she wasn’t designated a Jedi. 

Let me explain: at the end of Season 5, Ahsoka was “expelled” from the Jedi Order, and we can see confirmation that she still has not rejoined the order in S7E10, where Kenobi mentions that due to her not being a member of the order, Ahsoka is unable to lead her battalion (hence Rex’s promotion to Commander). In turn, when Order 66 is assigned, the clones on her cruiser would not see her as a target, which would buy Rex the time he needed to get his inhibitor chip out. 

In the trailer, I don’t know who or what was firing at her, but I assume it could have been a Death Watch remnant or something similar. The reason I’m confident it wasn’t clones shooting her is that we haven’t seen Rex undergo the procedure to withdraw his inhibitor; which means that if he’s not shooting, his men shouldn’t be shooting either. 

Am I completely off? What do you guys think?",Random theory I came up with (S7 spoilers)
StarWars,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",Ironic
StarWars,"The whole sage of Anakin skywalker becoming Darth Vader to me is why this whole saga was interesting and epic ( even if sequels almost ruined it ).

StarWars,"So, I was thinking about the film recently and how they could have done better. When Kylo is facing the Knights and Rei is facing Palpatine, it would have been better to have the previous Skywalkers, Obi, and Yoda ghost appear. Rey vs the Knights and Palpatine, only to have the force users appear to defend and help Rey. I mean we've seen Luke ghost handle a lightsaber, why not hint that and then when the fight goes down have them show up. They could have easily found their sabers, appear, and fight the Knights while she fights Palpatine. Like Obi said, you can strike me down but ill be more powerful then you could ever imagine.

StarWars,"(*Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Red Fly Sudios; I am simply a huge Darth Maul fanboy.)

Hey guys!

I just want to raise awareness about the cancelled video game, Darth Maul: The Battle of the Sith Lords. I come to this subreddit really fired up after watching a YouTube video I stumbled upon talking about Red Fly Studio’s cancelled Darth Maul game. If you have never seen or heard about this game, look it up. This is a game that Red Fly has reportedly continued to improve and update since its initial development (and subsequent termination by LucasArts) before Disney purchased LucasArts.

Stealth, fear, violence; this is a possibility for a Star Wars game to be a deeply immersive experience - with a character that we cannot get enough of. In the right hands and with enough support we can make this happen!

Not promoting a certain direction, but for example, EA has responded to input from the Star Wars community.

The Point: Lets have a discussion about how we can make this amazing game happen. I feel that there is a huge population of Star Wars gamers and this game would obviously be a best seller with high quality support. How can we make the larger gaming companies aware that the community wants this game? Perhaps the Red Fly could even release the game on their own if they had enough funding without the large gaming companies.",We (the fans) can make the cancelled Darth Maul game happen.
StarWars,"I’ve brought this up before, but I feel this is badly needed. The sequel trilogy is a mess and has a lot of things left to be explained, especially with the last one. We never get to see Han and Leia have Ben or see Luke train Ben and his Jedi temple. (Not that narratively we need to see these just examples of things you could do). Explain if there’s more to the story of why Luke tried to kill Ben. How and why was the first order formed? What went into forming the new republic? How were planets we’ve already had established affected by this? (The sequel trilogy almost never covers this and always introduced new planets and characters instead of pre-established ones. The new planets they do introduce always look very similar to earth and are never creative). Who is snoke and when and why did he come into power? How is he a clone? How did Palestine survive? What’s a soul link or whatever? How come Rey didn’t become posed like he said when she struck him down? Significance of reys yellow lightsaber? Cover more of Leia’s training? How did the sith troopers just get there? Did Luke maybe have kids? (Probably not, but we can hope there’s still a living sky walker out there). Is Jains or whatever her name is Lando’s daughter? Does Finn have the force? When did Palestine have a child? Why did they give Rey up? When was Rey born and under what circumstances? There’s this anonymous character out there who was Palestine’s child? Will Rey form a new Jedi council? Was the chosen one prophecy really all for nothing? There’s many more questions and potential plot lines, I feel an animated series would be great to answer all the questions or I’m sure they could answer some of they in future movies if they still continue the sequel trilogy. Thoughts and other questions?",Clone Wars type series for Sequel Trilogy?
StarWars,"So I’m hoping I’m posting this with correct flair. Maybe someone can point me in right direction. So question is about getting a clone helmet and armor, since Clone Wars I have grown to love the clones. I have a helmet however it’s a Stormtrooper helmet. I would love love LOVE to get a clone costume like not some clothes bull crap they use for kids Halloween outfits. Actual helmet and everything. Would love a 501st helmet but if it’s plain then maybe someone too can direct me what to use to paint it and I’ll come up with something",Clone costume
StarWars,"Obi makes a remark that ""only the imperial stromtroopers are this accurate"", well we all know how true that is. He also says that ""sand troopers aren't accurate"", I'm sure pod racers would disagree. Also couldn't he be just lying to Luke in order to fuel his anger for the empire? I mean he lied to him in almost entirety of ANH. He said that -""you're father wanted you to have his lightsaber when you are old enough"", we know that he said nothing like that, infact obi-wan picked the lightsaber in front of burning Anakin. He also says that Vader killed anakin, which is less then half the truth. I won't be surprised if he lied to him once more",What makes obi-wan think that stormtrooper killed lukes aunt and uncle?
StarWars,"So I’m just curious, with the success and all the hype surrounding these last few episodes of Clone Wars, and if Marvel’s “What If...” series is successful, do you think there’s any chance they could do an animated version of “What If” that takes place in the Star Wars universe? I mean, it’s fun to toy with alternate universes and both studios are owned by Disney now so it seems totally possible. What if Anakin never killed Dooku? What if Ahsoka joined Maul in hunting down the Emperor? So many interesting routes to go down. 

Would you guys enjoy something like this? Do you think this is ever a possibility in the future? I, for one, would be positively STOKED for an animated Star Wars “What If...” series.",Star Wars “What If...” series?
StarWars,"Trying to piece together what we know

C-3PO has been property of the House of Organa since Anakin fell to the Dark Side and Padmé died (though he was droid-napped by Jawas, was briefly ""owned"" by Owen Lars, has been ""lent"" to the Rebellion and Resistance), so I presume Leia passed him into the possession of whatever becomes of the Resistance (I am laughing at the thought that Poe is his new master).

R2-D2 was essentially Luke's from ANH onwards until Ben fell to the Dark Side, at which point Luke abandoned R2. Somehow he came back into Leia's possession (did Luke drop him of before heading to Ahch-To or did someone find him abandoned?). I imagine his ownership fate is the same as C-3PO's.

The Millenium Falcon was Han's property when he died. He and Leia never actually divorced, so is it safe to say that Leia owned it, but left it in the possession of Rey, Chewie, and the Resistance? I imagine Rey or Chewie would own it, but I would think Chewie would be going back to his family on Kashyyk like he did post-GCW and wouldn't need it. I imagine Rey is the new owner.

What are your thoughts?","Who own C-3PO, R2-D2, and the Millennium Falcon post-TRoS?"
StarWars,"I have a lot of problems with the sequel trilogy, but actually found myself enjoying a lot of what Rise of Skywalker had to offer. However, one recurring joke annoyed the hell out of me. What I'm talking about is C-3P0's memory wipe. So, pretty much every pre-wipe line of dialogue that came out of 3P0's mouth was played for laughs (no real problem with that; pretty much the same in the rest of the series), either by merit of the line itself or Poe telling him to shut up. 

Where I started to have a problem was the scene where his mind is wiped. It is dramatic, considering this is the *second* time he will have lost everything. I actually found myself getting emotional during most of the scene, seeing one of the only characters left from the original trilogy capable of fully expressing himself (R2 and Chewbacca can communicate, yes, but it feels less real considering the audience can't understand them) about to lose his cherished memories of his friends.

Then, he came out with the ""I just thought of something else"" line as he was being wiped, and I knew the emotional drama had been thrown out of the window of a 747 at 35k feet. Cue every line after this (up until R2's backup, which also annoyed me because why didn't he do that the first time around?) being a joke about how he can't remember anything. Then, despite his sacrifice, Poe *continues* to constantly tell him to shut up even when he is expressing that he has lost his entire life's worth of memories.

It calls back to my biggest complaint with the Last Jedi, being the constant undercutting of dramatic moments with forced comedy. RoS, in my opinion, did much better in that regard but this one running joke *really* rubbed me the wrong way.",C-3P0 in Rise of Skywalker.
StarWars," Anyone else feel that most articles and blogs written about SW are behind the times in terms of what fans feel. For example, most articles written say that ""most fans hate the prequels"", but that is no longer true. Older fans don't like the prequels but younger ans who grew up with them love them. Many even say revenge of the Sith is the best movie. There are prequel fans all over the internet. Now it is a pet peeve of mind to use the terminology ""most fans"" or ""fans agree"" anyway (no one truly can speak for SW fans as we are a diverse group) but even when they do the statement is followed by something that is no longer true, which makes the writer seem even more out of touch.

StarWars,"I've always been more than a bit confused at how the actors and crew describes their feelings about A New Hope at the time.

They always talk about how they didn't think much of it, or expect much of it.  It was just supposed to be some little silly sci go romp that might fund other projects and it blew up larger than they expected.

What's always confused me is...that doesn't seem to line up with the effort put in.

The massive, complicated models. The effort that went into the sets and designs. The people they hired for the project like John Williams and Alec Guinness. The research put into things like ww2 dog fight footage.

StarWars,"It wasn't so much an effort to 'subvert expectations' (which is more an indication people were mad that the movie didn't follow their theories or head canon which is both weird and pitiful) but a logical decision to phase out some things while propping up others. 

So obviously the things in regards to Rey's parentage and Luke's self-imposed isolation are explained whilst Snoke's backstory was shunned more in favour to utilise that character as a red herring for Kylo's conflict and apparent resolution. 

The Knights of Ren, which we now know weren't entirely critical to the trilogy to begin or end with (since JJ didn't know what to do with them either), remain(ed) conclusively inconsequential.

StarWars,"Maybe I’ve totally missed something in the movie or expanded lore, but sending Maul to face the Jedi doesn’t seem like it makes much sense. His plan was to create a crisis that required a vote of no confidence so that he could become Chancellor, right? Does killing the Jedi help that goal? I guess he could have been concerned that they would have defused the situation too quickly...

But I prefer to think that this was a hit on Qui-Gon.

So we know Palpatine has visions of the future and whatnot, yeah? What if he saw this young Chosen One killing him? What if he saw Anakin as a Jedi being the one who could stop his plans? And what if he knew that only Qui-Gon was capable of training him successfully? 

Remember, the Jedi Council is basically a Republic police force at this point, and Jinn was really the only TRUE Jedi left, still following the will of the Force rather than playing politics. Could Sidious have seen Jinn and his new Padawan as the last real threat to his master scheme, and sent Maul to eliminate him? 

Without Jinn, not only will Anakin lack proper guidance, but he’ll be vulnerable to corruption. And it’s not like he was too worried about keeping Maul around, so even if that uppity Zabrak dies, it’s still a win!

Just a theory! Would love to hear your thoughts!",Why did Sidious send Maul after the Jedi in TPM?
StarWars,"Here is my list:  
A Luke Skywalker-Centric Game - After Jedi Fallen Order 2, I would love a Luke Skywalker game set after ROTJ with Luke learning more about the Jedi, discovering new powers, meeting Snoke and searching for Ixegol. Mark Hamill was so underutilized in the ST, and Disney has an opportunity to fix that with a game, and I would love to have him come back and voice Luke Skywalker as the hero he wanted to be.  
A Bounty Hunter game - Whether it is the Mandalorian before the show or the 1313 game we never got. Give me a Bounty Hunter game!  
Imperial Commando - Even though Battlefront 2 is kind of like this, I'd prefer a single-player focused game that is of the clone commandos. I would have the first level be Order 66 and have them go through a story set before ANH. It would be cool to see these commandos go and finish off the remaining separatists and fight surviving Jedi.  
Knights of the Old or High Republic - Reestablish the Old Republic or give us a new story set in the High, I don't care. The only bummer about the High Republic is no Sith (or at least no Jedi will survive a Sith encounter).  
What ideas do you have?",What future Star Wars games do you want?
StarWars,"I remember after watching Force Awakens I said that to my wife. 

I felt like this was the angle they were maybe going to go for. 

Rey had her natural intuition for the Force, Finn was immune to the stormtrooper conditioning and Poe was an incredibly skilled pilot.

They all feel like qualities that would come naturally to those who are strong with the Force.

Don't get me wrong, I know that the Force encompasses everything in the Star Wars universe, I'm not saying everybody has to be a Jedi, but I had a vision in my head of the trio all learning to be Jedi in their own way and working together to best Snoke, Ren and the First Order.

The image of the three of them on the Falcon together, all using their own unique lightsaber by the end of the third movie in a big battle - just a new breed of Jedi all working together to restore peace.

Maybe they have qualities that balance each other out as Force users and this is what leads to success.

StarWars,"Even in the weirdest times, May 4th is just around the corner. Origin already started its Star Wars sale with some ~~sexy~~ pretty good deals, I just checked Steamdb and the usual is that tomorrow Steam starts their sale.

So, as said in the title, what are some great deals to take this May 4th?

I already have Battlefront II (2005) with loads of mod which almost updated it with the Disney stuff and some Clone Wars stuff. Still, I might like to dive deeper into the SW EU.

I personally don't like RPGs and would be more up to a 3rd person/1st person shooter as BFII, but maybe I give an exception. If it helps, these are some periods I'd like to know more:

**The Phantom Menace Prequel:** And I guess that's what KotOR tell. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's here where I go to know about the story of Darth Revan  
**Mid to Late Clone Wars:** I'm not sure how this stuff is organized, but I loved the 2003 CW series (I know it's not canon anymore and didn't develop much more than an animated series). Still, I loved Asajj Ventress personality and really would like a game focused on these times and with a better approach to her.  
**Pre and During OT:** Following the CW, this is a period I'd like to know more too, and even consider writing a fanfic around this time. I loved Rogue One though I know there aren't many games focusing on it (And I'll give a better detail later). That's what was my main point which made me bought BFII at first.  
**Post ROTJ:** I'm reading (Though it's been more than months the last time I touched it) the first book of Thrawn trilogy, which already gave a solid sequel to the OT, so a game around this time is not completely essential, but I might consider buying it.  


I have a somewhat medium PC. I haven't tried any new game which it didn't play, though I never forced it too much. Still, I guess my main focus is early 2000's up to early 2010's, but I'm up to any exceptions.

If it doesn't make this post too vague, I also accept any eventual giveaway SW might do of any species or simply free cool stuff.",What would be great game deals to pick for May 4th?
StarWars,"They're simply too powerful to exist on their own without completely warping the story to become about the inevitable last-ditch effort to destroy said Death Star weapon.

My problem isn't that Death Stars exist in Star Wars. The most concerning issue I have is that lazy writers will just keep pulling Death Stars out of their ass to artificially amp up their story's dramatic stakes without earning any of it. The Sequel Trilogy has especially begun to set this precedent, with TROS literally having a fleet of Death Star Destroyers appear out of nowhere. Before long, we'll just be seeing the same shitty Death Star plots recycled over and over again, and the threat of a planet-busting weapon will become diluted to the point of being meaningless. Seriously, what's stopping the bad guys from just retreating to the ""outer regions"" again and coming back with another Death Star? Because the way the Sequel Trilogy frames its planet-busting weapons, it seems like anyone can just flee to the ""outer regions"" and casually pick up a Death Star weapon at Walmart when the going gets too tough.

When you look at the Prequels, The Clone Wars, the Old Republic, and countless other Star Wars ancillary stories, *none* of them needed a big stupid Death Star to amp up their narrative stakes, yet they told some of the most revered stories in all of Star Wars. Hell, there was no place you could even put a Death Star in most of these stories without ruining what made them special. These stories *earned* their narrative stakes through smart story construction and proper buildup of tension and payoff. They were so much more varied and interesting stories than just ""we have to destroy X thing, let's hurry up and destroy X thing"". 

Even looking at the Original Trilogy, the progenitor of the Death Star, I'd argue that the Death Star really wasn't the point. Rather, the crux of the Original Trilogy's narrative was about Luke's personal journey from a farmboy into the hero the galaxy needed. The Death Star was only a small part of the Original Trilogy's narrative. In contrast, TROS made a point to emphasize that everything was about stopping Palpatine's ""Final Order"", to the extent that the movie had no room for meaningful character-building between its protagonists, since everyone was in a rush to get from point A to point B to point C to Palpatine's planet.

Death Stars are also a very short-sighted and wasteful storytelling device, because they inherently preclude the potential for future stories. When the Hosnian System was destroyed, so was any potential for side stories on those cities/planets. When Kijimi got blown up, there's another planet and civilization you have just removed entirely from your storytelling arsenal. This is something I highly suspect the writers over-utilizing Death Stars don't understand. It would have been cool to see stories set on the cities of the Hosnian System. It would have been cool to see cosmopolitan life in the New Republic. But none of that means anything now, because you just blew up the damn thing before we got a chance to see any of it. *Sure*, you could technically write a whole prequel about the establishment of the New Republic on the Hosnian System or something, but it would just be completely pointless since we already know it'll all be turned into smoldering space debris before long. At worst, a story like that would be a bitter reminder of how much more we could've had if the writers had just thought things through.

It would be interesting to me if someone developed a planetary shield system to hard-counter a Death Star's capability. At the very least, it would force Star Wars' narrative to grow beyond the tired and simplistic formula of Empire vs Rebels, since the power dynamics would be much more level here, and the antagonists would have to find more interesting ways of waging war in order to subjugate the galaxy. See what this is? This is innovating beyond the Original Trilogy's narrative formula. Again, most of Star Wars' stories have already moved past using Death Stars as a plot device. I'm really not sure why the Sequel Trilogy thought it was a good idea to bring them back without understanding what made them work in the Original Trilogy.",Star Wars is in serious need of a hard counter to Death Star and Death Star-like weapons.
StarWars,"So just started watching the Clone Wars for the first time in my life, really having fun with it although S1 is a bit slow. Got to E11 where Dooku gets captured and while Anakin and Obi-Wan are talking to the leader I notice some familiar song in the background... ITS BOLLYWOOD MUSIC. HAHAHA I laughed so hard, why is there bollywood music in an animated TV show? I laughed because it happened twice in the same epsiode and as someone from that culture I thought it was super cool but it just caught me off guard, but the show is good so far.",The Clone Wars episode S1 E11...
StarWars,"Hello, I’m new to this sub and I wouldn’t say I’m the biggest fan compared to some of the people in this subreddit but I’m definitely a huge fan. I really, really love the franchise as a whole. I’ve recently got a lot more interested in it and would like to explore the lore more so I figured I’d start with some of the famous animated shows that are offered and talked about a lot. However, I’m not sure which one to choose. The 2003 version’s style is definitely my preference (I’ve seen bits and pieces of it) but I heard the 2008 version is near perfect. (Have yet to see yet). Is there a major difference between the two? Is there anyway someone could explain the differences including pros and cons to each? Would love to get started with some help! Thanks so much",Which to watch: Star Wars the Clone Wars (2008) or Star Wars Clone Wars (2003)
StarWars,"People are more willing to accept that ""The Child"" is nobody special yet they couldn't accept Ren saying Rey was a nobody.

I've seen more videos trying to explain her origin as being related to somebody big than I have of baby Yoda. 

Obviously right now we know she is a Palpatine, but before ROS everyone was trying so hard to prove she was a Skywalker or Kenobi.

Why are people more willing to accept baby Yoda as not related to anyone whereas Rey must've been related to somebody? They both haven't had much training but seem to have an innate ability to control the force.",Something I find kind of interesting
StarWars,"So I just started to binge the season and been watching this arc and so far I really enjoy it. I've beard/seen people memeing about it, saying it's not the best, it shouldnt of been a thing. Honestly I think it's great. It's a different change of pace from all of the action clones vs droids, jedi vs sith, stuff like that and I enjoy that. Dont get me wrong I love epic battles but I also enjoy seeing the life of the normal people in the universe, just like in this arc. I dont know it's just, it's just nice. What do you guys think of it? Why do you dislike or like it?",Unpopular opinion but I actually enjoyed watching the Ahsoka/Trace Arc
StarWars,"I've commonly come across people claiming that they consider Vader and Anakin to be different people which confuses me because Dooku and Palpatine for example are not considered to be different individuals than who they were they became Siths. 

And I doubt that Dooku killing Palpatine or Palpatine destroying the death star himself would make people sympathetic towards them since they are responsible for orchestrating a major galactic conflict to take over the galaxy. And in the case of palpatine, everything that happened during the empire. 

Maybe I don't fully understand how the dark side works but it seems like Anakin is treated differently so people can have an easier time with him being redeemed because they liked the person he was before enough, regardless of his crimes after becoming a sith.

I'd frankly love to know more so please explain :)",The dark side and personal accountability
StarWars,"I know we saw her ""He's dead Jim"" scene, yes I reference star trek in the Star Wars credit, but I'm unsure. Bacta, perfect prosthetics, neural implants, and medical droids with perfect precision. I know the galaxy was crumbling around them, but what if they faked it to save her from ""him"". Just like they faked Luke and Leia. I know it's just Lucas' heavy-handed writing,  and she probably did die. But I like to think she didn't. Leia said she'd seen her mother's face, of course, this could've been a force vision or most likely forgetfulness. But part of me wants a happier ending for her, where she secretly got to raise at least one of her children. Maybe much different, twin birth and spousal abuse are a lovely combination to create some nasty PTSD. But the force is strange, almost like too many peoples, or one big empir-organization, has a hand in it. In my mind, at least, Padme got a restful life. Instead of a hasty write out.",Did Padme really die?
StarWars,"Now, I had seen all the movies, but none of the shows, prior to me living with this friend, lets call him Mark. Mark and I have been friends for sometime now, and moved in together with one other friend about 2 1/2 years ago. And one day about a year or so ago, we started watching the Phantom menace, then he suggested we watch The Clone Wars series, then after we pretty much binged that, we watched rebels, all the movies followed. I cannot express how much I have grown to love Star Wars, and its thanks to Mark and his love for this franchise. 

Gonna keep this short and sweet but, I just wanted to give a shout out to my friend for introducing me to something new to love!",Roommate converted me into fan of this franchise.
StarWars,"As a preface, I was **not** excited when this movie was announced and lowered my expectations once Lord and Miller fired/left the project. After first viewing, I liked it, but wasn't big on it.

This is probably my third time rewatching it and wow. There's so many cool things in this movie. Mimban, the train heist, mudtroopers, SPACE YACHTS, Teras Kasi, Lando, *Lando's capes*. I've warmed up to the Kessel Run, L3 and the marauders, too. Beckett and Dryden Vos are really fun to watch and it's such a shame they died. 

Also I really like Favreau as Rio Durant. He has a short amount of time but is really charming.

Do I think Lord and Miller's previous version would have been even better? Yes. *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Lego Movie, 21* and *22 Jump Street*, and *Into the Spider-verse* were either great or amazing and subverted their genres in the best (most non-controversial) ways. But Ron Howard's version is just some good ass Star Wars. 

It's a shame we don't have more material coming off of the story threads they started here. Any of its characters could easily migrate to their own spin-off series on D+!  I would love to see Qi'ra's meeting with Maul on Dathomir, or Han and Chewie's first adventures with Jabba.",I just rewatched Solo. It gets better every time.
StarWars,"I don't know if anyone else does this, but whenever I hear a line from Vader whether it be from a game, movie, show, or whatever, I always try to hear that same line in the voice of Matt Lanter and Hayden Christensen. A lot of times, I just can't picture it working. Sometimes lines of dialogue are too complex to seem like something they would say. For example, ""We need not be adversaries. The Emperor will show you mercy, if you tell me where the remaining Jedi can be found"". Try to picture either of them saying that. It just doesn't work in my mind. But, basically I was just wondering if other people do the same thing or if I'm just weird.",Matching up Christensen and Lanter with JEJ
StarWars,"After the prequels, he decided to stop Star Wars forever and admit that everything has an end. He realized the Saga could no longer be expanded without making the previous generation angry as fuck, creating an cumulative effect of negative reaction because, even if the younger generation gets seduced, previous ones (that are more than one after the prequels) will always be unsatisfied. Poetry and the path of the hero have a limit and repetition can only be tolerated when you put a different dress/context on it.

So, considering Star Wars market value will inevitably shrink year after year no matter what (like everything in this Universe), he tried to sell it now it had some worth. Disney's greed appeared into scene to buys it and make money: they failed.

Besides this rational motivation, Lucas felt the need for redemption because of Prequels mistakes. He knew Disney will screw it all, giving a new perspective by comparision. Today, Prequels are an absolute piece of art compared with Sequels, even for haters (usually Original gen).

So, George Lucas is a genius.

Thanks.","George Lucas is a genius, his plan was a masterpiece."
StarWars,"So it's universally accepted that the 4th of May is ""May the 4th Be With You"" Day, a play on the iconic quote ""May The Force be with you."" And some people regard May 5th or 6th as ""Revenge of the Fifth/Sixth"", a play on Revenge of the Sith. This got me thinking of other plays on iconic quotes from star wars for the 5th or 6th. My favorites include ""I find your lack of Fifth disturbing"" and ""I have a bad feeling about Sixth"". Plays on ""I find your lack of faith disturbing"" and "" I have a bad feeling about this"". I think it'd be cool if either of these caught on, not that I expect them to.","You've Heard of May the 4th Be With You, and Revenge of the Fifth..."
StarWars,"There are millions of posts about how bad these movies are, it’s getting a little boring at this point so why don’t we share what we love about these movies.

I love all the characters. They are all really memorable and likeable, even the Villians. The plot is simple but works really well as an episodic adventure not unlike the stories that inspired George.

The visuals are breathtaking and I could cover my wall in screenshots from these movies.

I really like these movies, they are my favorite Star Wars next to revenge of the Sith and clone wars.

What are your thoughts on them.",Sequel Trilogy Appreciation
StarWars,"This is the greatest piece of Star Wars we’ve had in years. Without the shadow of a doubt.
Sure TCW has built this all up for years(as it should’ve, and it’s great) but this sole episode gave me more cinematic and Star Wars joy than any of the sequel films combined. Dave Filoni shows he should be president of Lucasfilms. Sure the Trace arc felt like a waste of episodes(not every TCW is great but I feel the Trace arc, in context, was a waste of time) but it was kind of worth it for what we got. Also Ray Park killed it!!! I didn’t know he was gonna’ feature, but as soon as Maul started fighting I knew.",”The Phantom Apprentice”
