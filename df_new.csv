StarWars,"Backstory- I was looking through some old, scrapped scenes from season 7 (some trashed story arcs, some altered scenes that didn't make the cut) and I came across an older version of Episode 5, wherein Trace is instead a male character named Nyx, who was apparently cut do to being to similar to Han Solo and the fact that Ahsoka already had a love interest. You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy ""forced"" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to ""promote her political agenda."" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?",Star Wars fans make me ashamed to be a Star Wars fan
StarWars,"It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own ""canon"". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to watch most of the show and just kind of ignore the stuff with him? Or is he really integral to the show overall? I know I may be stubborn...but to me, Darth Maul is dead! (There are other things I didn't like in the show as well, that was just the one that finally made me give up...but maybe I should give it another chance...)",Should I watch The Clone Wars?
StarWars,"I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. 

• It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.

• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. 

• You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. You are also able to kill people and take there vehicles, weapons, ammunition and gear.

• It will be open world and have multiple planets like Kessel, Coruscant, Tatooine etc.

• There would be space combat and tactical hyperspace travel having you calculate jumps on the galaxy map and needing to upgrade your hyper drive for bigger jumps. 

• There would be a deeps combat system with ranged weapons like blasters and explosions, melee weapons like vibro blades and class based ability’s like a Trandoshan’s heat vision. 

• Your ship would act as you home base where you can upgrade gear, store items and prisoners, save the game etc.

There is like a 1% chance Disney would make this because it would probably be rated M but I can hope. Anyway thoughts?",Star Wars video game idea

But we must also remember that the way in which Anakin ""brought balance to the force"" wasn't pretty. And then there is Luke who also became known as the one chosen by Obi-Wan on the (ST Rebel Show). After all he was the last Jedi at the time, the one who defeated the empire and the one who brought Darth Vader back to the light side.

StarWars,"I just watched the opening of the Last Jedi and I was wondering do sci-fi productions like Star Wars employ military advisors of any sort.

When the first order shows up to destroy the resistance they use a dreadnought with what looks like a slow to reload weapon.
Would it not have made sense to first destroy the rebel cruiser which is mobile and can deploy fighters against them?
Like the planets not going anywhere and there’s almost no one on it when they arrive anyway.

Also I loved the look of the rebel bombers but why make them bunch up, one of them gets taken out and the resulting explosion literally takes out another two.

And finally this isn’t so much a military question but where does the gravity that carries the bombs down to the dreadnought come from? They’re in space right?",Do films like Star Wars have have military advisors?
StarWars,"Not important. Most Star Wars media outside of the films George Lucas helped create have gone very far away from it’s true message. Yes they are enjoyable like The Mandalorian or even TCW but I think people should not care too much about wether something is Star Wars or not. If you want to know the real meaning of Star Wars, it’s about letting go. To let go of attachments, feelings and to serve the greater good. If art is the representation of one’s belief, that means this has been the true meaning of Star Wars, as George has expressed his wishes for people to “be more rationale” as he describes how you must avoid the allures of riches, such was the case of his early years writing Star Wars, avoiding job offers which would have distracted him from his film goals.",The true meaning of Star Wars is

However, I remember the one time Obi Wan decided to pull an Anakin and disobey the council,  it literally caused Satine to get killed. Obi wan probably believes that it was his fault for getting Satine killed by disobeying the council and trying to rescue her by himself.

StarWars,"Are there any good comprehensive, technical, or from an expert source on the quality difference between the 4K UHD Blu Ray Skywalker Saga boxset Vs. the Disney+ versions of these movies?

So far I've seen AVForums doing daily reviews of it, as of this post just Episodes 1-3. Assuming Episode 4 sometime tomorrow. I don't want to wait until Wednesday for the boxset to sell out before I can get a verdict if there's another good source out there on this. Amazon listed it as ""Limited Edition"", like those words mean anything anymore but I don't know in this case either.

I know the biggest benefit is the guarantee of consistant quality when you watch on UHD Blu Ray versus a streaming service but I'd really like to know if there's a difference in the masters/presentation itself. I'm also assuming there's no extra/commentary features to access via Disney+.

Also I have not owned Star Wars since the VHS, yes, you read that right. I skipped the DVDs and the Blu Ray set from 2011.

StarWars,"Feel free to disagree with me, I’d like this to be a discussion in the comments. 

When Kylo went to take off his mask in TFA, I remember my whole body tensing up. I was expecting to look into the face of the newest evil in the galaxy. But when it came off, I was slightly disappointed.

Let me say now that Adam Driver did a fantastic job, and I wouldn’t want anyone else in the role. It wasn’t his face that I had a problem with, it was the fact that there wasn’t anything wrong with his face. 

In my personal opinion, the most scary and threatening sith/dark siders had something going on with their face. I expected pale or cracked skin, maybe some tattoos, or perhaps a lack of hair or even scarring from some traumatic event. And most of all, the kicker for me, he had normal eyes, unlike every other major dark-side character, sith or otherwise. Even Dooku had yellow eyes when he wasn’t actively trying to hide his allegiance to the sith. 

This next paragraph contains SPOILERS for Episode 9: The Rise or Skywalker. 

If Kylo had yellow eyes, the scene in which he heals Rey and sacrifices himself could’ve been ten times better. Imagine him using his own life-force to heal her, his eyes returning to their normal color with his last act of purity and goodness, and upon seeing his return to his true self, Rey utters a relieved “Ben...” 

This would’ve changed everything in my opinion. What do you think?",SPOILERS: Let’s talk about Adam Driver’s face reveal in TFA.
StarWars,"I’m rewatching that arc, and it really gets to me in a way. It starts off as a regular investigation that were used to in the show, but quickly turns dark. I started to get that feeling of unease as soon as Barriss came into play, and when Ashoka says “I guess I’m fooling you just like I am everyone else” I knew it was starting. We, as viewers, see everything a little bit faster than Ashoka does, the key card, her lightsabers, the dead clones, etc. Knowing how it ends makes it even worse because every scene you say to yourself “what if this has happened” and just get a feeling of hopeless as it all unfolds. 

Okay sorry for the long rant I just had to get it out somewhere.",Ahsoka’s downfall as a Jedi at the end of season 5 is the saddest part of Star Wars.

StarWars,"A ""what if"" show similar to the Marvel one coming out on disney+ would be a good idea. For anyone unaware, what that's doing is changing one thing in each MCU movie from Iron Man to Far from Home and basically making an alternate universe. I think there's potential there to not only adapt the movies kinda like those comics a while back, but add some legends stories in animated form. How cool would it be to see the OG Thrawn trilogy as a part of the show? So many other possibilities too. New Jedi Order, X-wing, Yuuzhan vong war, even Shadows of the Empire could work. That's what Lucasfilm's next TV show should be, it could appeal to both Disney fans and Legends fans. The Disney fans would enjoy seeing movies like Rogue One, TFA, TROS, etc with a different spin, and the legends fans would love seeing characters like Thrawn, Corran Horn, Kyle Katarn, Dash Rendar, Mara Jade, and more on the screen, overall, if done well, this could bring both sides of the fandom together and be something truly amazing.",What the next animated series should be on Disney+
StarWars,"This would not be difficult to work into the story, and I think it would be incredibly important to add. Coruscant could be the last hold out for the First Order troops. They could be led by a familiar character, possibly Nash Windrider of Lost Stars? This book would be a great way to dive into some characters who lacked screen time in TROS, especially Finn, and they could even add the storm trooper rebellion.

StarWars,"So rereading legends it kind of surprised me that we really only have one book about Luke's jedi going off and doing jedi things during the New Republic era. It also surprised me just how few books in the NR era there were or how few focused on Luke. As a kid it felt like their was always another book to pick up at the store. 

But anyways it was just shocking to find out that of all the books published from the NR period forward only one really had a Jedi being assigned a mission, going out, helping people , and coming back who's name didn't end in Katarn, Horn, or Solo. We do have the Jaden Korr novels later but those are more him stumbling into a plot than being actively assigned something to do or choosing to go do something. 

Maybe it was just that with the New Jedi Order books taking up so much space and time and effort they didn't think people would be interested in those kinds of stories or would rather have those types of stories told about Jedi during the Prequel trilogy since those movies were coming out at the same time. 

That would make more sense to me than just no author having a good idea/story they wanted to tell in a time period when you could basically design your own jedi. 

The comics were the same. Their is the Leviathan comic about Luke's first class but it feels more like a extension of the Jedi Academy books than its own thing.

So Scourge is really unique in that way I suppose. Its also a pretty good book. Its plot is decent and the characters enjoyable. Though it is basically a police procedural in book form.",It's odd to realize that Scourge is the only book we really have about Luke's Jedi going around and doing Jedi things
StarWars,"I love the way Hux was portrayed in the Rise of Skywalker because I can understand why JJ would no longer view Hux as competent or intimidating after being so gullible to Poe. Hux does everything he shouldn't. Spies on his own army, is overzealous with Kylo Ren, speaks out of turn, foolishly thinks an imperial general would buy his bullshit excuse as to how Poe, Finn, and Chewie escaped.

I think Hux was used appropriately in the Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi, although I think the conference call went on for a *little* bit too long. So if you hated Hux with the conference call, I think you should welcome that he was killed so easily because he was such a bumbling idiot during his call with Poe. He died at the hands of an experienced imperial general. JJ used what Rian gave him and I think Hux was used well in both movies. Hux gets tossed around by Kylo and is a poser to the rank he possesses. ""I sense unease, General Hux.""","Given Hux's incompetence during his conference call with Poe in The Last Jedi, it makes sense why he would have such an unheroic death in the Rise of Skywalker"
StarWars,"Let me start by saying that I respect your opinion. You can like or dislike whatever you want. That also applies to myself so please allow me this time to share my opinion.

My Star Wars is the Prequel Trilogy and Sequel Trilogy. I feel nothing for the OT.

Now don’t get me wrong, I respect the OT, but when I see Luke, Han and Leia I see old Luke, Solo Han and General Organa. When I think of Darth Vader I only see Anakin, not Vader. When I think of Obi Wan it’s always Ewan McGregor not Alec Guinness.

My Hero is Rey Skywalker. The lost girl who was desperate to be the hero of the story. Only to find darker and Darker truths about herself. Who fell so close to the dark side, only to be saved by her new family. And with Rey, I admire Ben Solos story. The child with the wait of legacy on his shoulders, who lashed out to find his own path and destroyed so much by denying the goodness inside him. Ending with him saving himself and destroying the Dark Mastermind who not only twisted him but the galaxy as a whole.

Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex, Darth Maul, Sidious, The Clone Wars, The Resistance and First Order, Starkiller Base, The malevolence, The Final Order, Admiral Holdo, Poe Dameron, Beckett, Dryden Vos, Director Krennic and Rogue One.

Many even say revenge of the Sith is the best movie. There are prequel fans all over the internet. Now it is a pet peeve of mind to use the terminology ""most fans"" or ""fans agree"" anyway (no one truly can speak for SW fans as we are a diverse group) but even when they do the statement is followed by something that is no longer true, which makes the writer seem even more out of touch.

Hi all,

I’ve recently gotten into Star Wars and, after having only watched one of the prequel films previously, have now marathoned all of the films twice since quarantine started.

I can’t believe how much I’ve enjoyed it, and feel like I’ve missed out on not getting into this sooner.

Unfortunately, I found that there were a few parts of the films that I struggled to piece together (how Maul was around in Solo, for example). I’ve only seen the films, (the 3 trilogies, Rogue One &amp; Solo), so I’m wondering what you’d all recommend for me to engross myself further into the Star Wars universe. 

Somebody already told me I should watch The Mandalorian, so I’m planning to do that, but are there other series I should watch? Are there any books that you’d recommend, as I’ve been told there are a staggering amount of Star Wars books, and I’d ideally like to find the ones that cover the most detail and are canon?

I’m really open to all and any suggestions, so thanks in advance!",Best way to expand my knowledge of (canon) lore &amp; the overall Star Wars universe beyond the films.

4.) She lived on a desert planet without knowing her real parents

StarWars,"Yes i am way too late for this and I’m sure someone has already said it, but I just wanted to give an appreciation for rogue one as a whole, despite Vader’s really badass ending scene.

All of the characters in the movie were believable. None had any “special connection” to the force or any sort of magical plot device that makes them unique somehow.
Jyn Erso’s determination and her animosity for Krennic is purely derived from her father’s fate as well as carrying his torch. She was a formidable warrior, as she has been through many trials that led her to be one.

This goes the same for Cassian; he has been in the fight since a very young age, experiencing both the separatists as well as the rebellion. No doubt he has all the experience thats been shown on screen.

Not much to say for Baze and Chirrut, except that chirrut is perhaps the first force user without a lightsaber shown on screen. 

And then there’s Krennic, a man so stuck up in his ambition and pride wanting to make a name for himself within the empire. 

As for the scene where the rebellion leaders were conferring about the death star plans, when Jyn said to rely solely on hope; yet Mon mothma didn’t go “she is right we are heroes and we need to fight the bad guys for the sake of being good”, instead it was a collective decision based on how little evidence there was for the death star plans having the bug galen planted, and that led to Jyn’s crew going rogue.

They ended up attacking Scarif because they were forced to. The mon calamari, who were already determined to take down the empire in the first place made that decision for them.

So TLDR I just wanted to say how Rogue One’s story made sense as a whole without relying too much on cliche fantasy tropes. All the characters were what they are because of their efforts. There was not a single prophecy or magical plot device to make them succeed.",Appreciation for Rogue One.
StarWars,"I'm almost 30 and have somehow managed to not see a single Star Wars movie. That is, until the coronavirus lockdown gave me time to watch them all. In a row. Over 11 consecutive days. I just finished tonight with The Rise of Skywalker.

And I was pretty upset after the credits rolled. I've heard so much division, hatred, and outcry over everything other than the original trilogy. I liked them all. I loved Rouge One and The Last Jedi. I didn't find the original trilogy to be vastly superior. I thought the prequels had great moments, and I really liked the new sequel characters.

I had avoided watching these movies because I had heard that all but three were terrible. I didn't find that to be true at all. I enjoyed 11 movies. I think it's terrible that there's so much hate. I feel bad for the people who worked hard on these movies.

 I know nostalgia plays a role in how people feel about the prequels and sequels (and I have no nostalgia for this series, since I saw them all over the past week and a half). But it was honestly shocking how much of a difference I found between people's feelings about the series and what I actually watched.","Just watched all 11 live-action movies for the first time, back-to-back-to-back.

StarWars,"After dealing, players can do four things before the dice is rolled: Gain, Swap, Stand, Junk. 
I have the SWGE version of the game and I’m a little confused by the Gain rules. 
-Take the top card from the draw pile. You may keep the card or you may discard. If you pick the option of discarding, you must discard before you draw. 

To me this means either two things: 1) you can pick up a card and if you don’t like it you can put that card back without having to lose any of your original cards but that ends your turn. Or 2) you have to put one card in first and then pick up another card which is what the swap rule is.

Does anyone know why this decision was made, and if there is a version of the soundtrack that was released that didn't significantly change the score as shown in the film?

StarWars,"Learning from your past mistakes is great on a personal level and a really good lesson in humility, endurance, and in how to progress. But a lot of times when applied to other people or countries or ways of life it comes off as an example of what not to be. That the thing you are learning about is bad/wrong and you don't want to be like them, you may even pity them.

Which is honestly how I see the presentation of Luke in the last Jedi when it comes to using his failures as an example. Because remember when Yoda told him that it was before he force projected himself to Crait. The actions on crait, which at least start his redemption and path back to the person I was hoping to see more of, come later and while they are how a Jedi should act they aren't what Yoda is saying Rey should learn from. 

What I get from it is it saying ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and run away"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and  and attack your nephew"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and  abandon your duties and the force"" ""Don't be like Luke Skywalker and repeat the mistakes of the old jedi order"". 

Its all ""don't be"" ""don't be"". Their is no do be in that lesson. Their is no ""Do be like Luke Skywalker and do X"" Their is no positive lesson there. Their is nothing there to make a person want to aspire to be Luke Skywalker or be like him (again their is Crait but that isn't part of Yoda's message and Rey's lesson).

When Luke is on the Island he is trying to push Rey away and gives a (very slanted) history of the order and the fall of Anakin but he offers no way to fix it. No postive change that can be done. Same when he talks about his failings as a teacher. No example of a change. No conversation about what he done right. 

""failure is the best teacher"" comes more off to me like that cartoon of the woman pointing out the homeless man to her kid and saying ""Do good in school so you don't end up like him"" 

Its all about Luke's failure and nothing about what he did right or what he learned from it and how Rey should not make the same mistakes its just ""don't be like Luke and the Jedi because they are bad"" 

Now Crait does give a good example of being Luke but again that isn't part of the message. Heck that's even more about being a message of hope to the galaxy at large not really about the Jedi Order. So it feels like at least from TLJ Luke would be used as a example of what future jedi don't want to be, a warning to students not someone to aspire to be like. 

Thankfully the VD for TROS fixed that a bit to where Rey does have his notes and journals in the Sacred Texts which means the new order will at least be using something positive he left. And he has talked to Rey more and does go more into how his image on crait helped. 

So it doesn't seem like he will be just a example of what a Jedi Shouldn't do/be. But taking TLJ by its self and that quote by its self that is really what it felt like to me. Like Luke Skywalker was a example of everything Rey and her Jedi should not be or do.","I honestly can not separate the idea of ""Failure is the best teacher"" from ""a example of what not to be"" when it comes to Luke."
StarWars,"The lack of a scar on Rex at this point means that he has not yet taken out his chip. Additionally, in the trailer we see Ahsoka stanced up on the bridge of the cruiser and Rex on the ground. This implies that Rex receives Order 66 and fights himself out of compliance while Clones attack Ahsoka. I think Rex will beg Ahsoka to remove it for him, or even at some point beg Ahsoka to kill him (way too unlikely imo since it doesn’t seem in his character but Rex is about to go to a SUPER dark place). Thoughts? 

I also have been thinking for a while and the possibility that Ahsoka swipes along his head with a lightsaber seems possible but unlikely given her combat skill and just how dangerous it is. But, given Rex is on the ground in pain without a helmet her being caught off guard could be a time to see it. Initially I actually thought we were gonna see Rex intervene in the Maul fight and he would be hit with the Darksaber on the head. Would’ve been a nice emotional scene with Rex on the ground and Ahsoka thinking Maul just killed him. Brings emotional gravity.",Theory on Rex’s inhibitor chip
StarWars,"Really, there's so much that could be done with those fifteen years before the end of the first season of Rebels. So much Ahsoka could have gone through and done in that time. More than enough stuff for another TV series, no?

* What happened after Order 66? How and when did she learn of that and what did she do then? Was she hunted too?
* What did Ahsoka do for a living? How did she use her force powers, yet hide them at the same time?
* Did she try (and manage) to find surviving jedi?
* When did she start fighting the Empire? When and how did she make contact with Senator Organa? When did she become ""Fulcrum""? How did she help various rebel cells?
* And of course there are so many other characters who could play a role or two in a series like that.

StarWars,"I am here to give everyone a place to rant about the Disney Sequel Trilogy.

Note: I haven't watch the Sequel Trilogy. I am just mirroring what others have said.

First, let me put my credits in with some logical rant material. Pandering to SJWs have a part in it. Rey wasn't necessary to be added into the Trio of Terror. They also really didn't used the established plot to its advantage. They made expectations that they didn't live up to, forced us to make too many assumptions, and threw away plots that they could have easily used.

Now, hurtful rant mode is activated. WHAT WAS DISNEY THINKING? FROM GHOSTBUSTERS (2016) TO THE NEW BIRDS OF PREY, HOLLYWOOD THINK APPEALING TO SJWS IS GOOD. THEY ALIENATE (pun intended) HUGE SECTIONS OF THE FAN BASE, BASICALLY SAY THAT ""Men are bad"", COMPLAIN THAT ""Fans are so entitled"", EITHER DON'T INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS OR KILL THEM OFF, PUSH AGENDAS AND MAKE THESE FRANCHISES LOW-QUALITY, CASH GRABS OF REBOOTS WITH PAPER-THIN CHARACTERS, POOR QUALITY PLOTS, AND FRICK UP THE ORIGINAL CONTINUITY. THE PREQUELS WERE BETTER. EVEN MICHAEL BAY'S TRANSFORMERS WAS A BETTER REBOOT THAN STAR WARS AND GHOSTBUSTERS (2016).

StarWars,"I'm compulsively anti-spoiler.  To the point where I close my eyes, cover my ears and go ""lalala"" during trailers.  My friends make fun of me.

On the morning before I saw ROS  I was watching SNL Weekend Update from the night before.  The setup to one joke was about how the new Star Wars movie had the franchise's first gay kiss.  I immediately closed the video before hearing the punch line.  I was pretty pissed because I made it this far without knowing anything about the movie and this one stupid thing got through.  I mean I know its no ""Luke I am your Father"" or anything but understand I go out of my way to know NOTHING about these movies before seeing them

So I assumed the joke had to be referencing Poe and Finn since I remember reading ""speculation"" that they might be gay from somewhere at sometime.  This assumption was all but confirmed from the very first scene of the movie where they bickering like a cliche married couple.  I was kind of bummed that I already knew the big reveal sure to come at the end but whatever.

Scene after scene kept reinforcing that these two were secretly in love.  Like when Finn goes ""Rey I need to tell you something!"" as he's sinking in mud.  Clearly he was desperate confess his relationship with Poe, not wanting the secret to die with him.  And all the scenes with Poe and his ex girlfriend and how she was heartbroken yet forgiving?  Clearly Poe ended their relationship abruptly when coming out as a gay man.

Anyway, the real surprise ending for me was that these two were just bros the whole time.","I misinterpreted a ""spoiler"" and watched Rise of Skywalker assuming the entire movie was setting up Poe and Finn to be a gay couple."
StarWars,"I'm not sure if anyone has thought of this as a mechanic, but the way we think of damage in Star Wars games from lightsaber combat is that the lightsaber strikes the combatant during battle, maybe this is stupid on my part but what about introducing a damage mechanic where the combatant doesnt actually take damage from hitting the character (like how a real Star Wars battle would be irl) but instead of a damage bar, a stamina bar that you would have to drain to get a hit which would end the battle.

I'm guessing different alien Jedi (and even Siths) think about, view, and use it differently,

Edit: additionally, some aliens are bound to serve the concept of emotion differently, or not at all.

StarWars,"I started rebels 4 days ago with very low expectations. From what I had seen of the show it had its moments but they were very few and far between. After watching all four seasons I realize that though this was partially correct, there was much more story and lore than I originally expected and I ended up thoroughly enjoying the show. 

One of the things I loved were all of the callbacks to the Clone Wars. All the, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, references to battles and characters from the show was great. When we meet Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters, he introduces Numa. Right away I remembered her as the girl that Waxer and Boil saved in season 1 of the Clone Wars and it just made me so happy. I also can't tell you how happy I was to see Rex and Ahsoka reunite. That was something I didn't know I needed.

The lore that the show dives into is also great. It explores parts of the force that had never been seen before, but unlike The Last Jedi, it does it in a way that's built up to and not just shoved in your face out of the blue. The world between worlds and connection to the Mortis Arc in the Clone Wars was so well done.

Also, Kanan's death was easily the most heroic and emotion filled deaths I've ever seen. Allowing him to regain his sight at the last second so he could see the woman he loves and his friends one last time was absolutely heart wrenching. Thank you Dave Filoni for that amazing scene. 

My only major gripe is how incompetent the storm troopers are. They would miss nearly every shot and only land one if the plot required it. There were very few, if any cases throughout the show of any of the main characters actually getting hit. It made you feel as if they were in no danger at all unless inquisitors or someone else was there. It also made the attempts at large battles a bit underwhelming. The first one that comes to mind is Season 4 episode 14 ""A Fools Hope"". Near the end of the episode, the rebels are grouped up on a tiny platform with 7 or 8 of them behind two small boxes. They are surrounded on nearly all sides yet only one person gets hit and its only in the shoulder. I'm not saying that the scene and episode weren't entertaining, I'm just saying that there wasn't a real sense of danger. 

Overall the show starts off slow and takes a while to get going. A few of the characters are annoying to start off and the storm troopers are incompetent throughout the entire show. As it progresses everyone undergoes great character development and fulfillment. It was great to actually get to see nearly all of the character arcs get finished.

StarWars,"So I’ve recently been trying to watch Resistance and there’s a few questions that have come up as I’m trying to get through it. So I always assumed that the First Order was created by ex-imperials but one thing that boggles my mind is why do they seem so well funded compared to the Resistance. We know that the current galactic government is the New Republic to replace the old Empire. That being said, I would imagine most member worlds of the Republic and later Empire would be part of it. Hence they should have the majority of the same resources as the Republic or Empire. But in the sequels we see them using the same ships that were being used 30 years prior, something we didn’t see as the Republic transitioned to the Empire. The Empire got all new stuff really quick. Instead it’s the First Order that’s loaded enough to have larger fleets and build Starkiller Base. The other thing that doesn’t make sense is why is the Resistance called that? Isn’t the Resistance technically the army of the New Republic? Why do they look as ragtag as the Rebellion did?

I know the easy BTS answer is that they were trying to copy the original trilogy as much as possible for the sequel trilogy (TLJ maybe being the exception) but it still doesn’t make sense that the First Order (which I suppose would be politically similar to the CIS) is massively better funded, equipped and organized than what should technically be the official army of the reigning galactic government. I kinda think of it like a Neo-Nazi group being more heavily armed and better manned than the US military. 

Am I just crazy and over thinking things?",Can someone explain something to me about the political state in the sequels?
StarWars,"...instead of keeping the six episodes plus Clone Wars as canon, then trying to build a new, more complex and cohesive universe around their already existing plot holes, inconsistent script and acting quality, outdated themes, tropes, visuals and special effects etc.

They should have followed the MCU footsteps, by building a new canon from scratch, all the while taking as much inspiration as they needed from old movies, shows, novels and comics. Take and adapt whatever felt already well written out from previous works, but without having any actual constraints when it comes to their canon.

Completely enslaving the current canon directly to OT and PT (without the possibility of changing the overall tone, events, stories and characters from those older movies) while trying to build an open universe type of franchise which would exceed or at least rival the MCU, is a much more difficult task.

It didn't help that they unnecessarily steered clear even of many good parts of the old EU (current Legends). Most of it was utter chaos, with no Story Group or anything similar in those times. But certain works from that period are truly top of the line, and parts of their ideas and plot lines should have been implemented in mainstream movies, not just supporting shows/novels/comics, or completely left out.

Don't get me wrong, I really like and enjoy Disney SW, but at the same time I feel it barely realized 10% of its possible potential. On the other hand, Superhero themes weren't too popular before the MCU (at least not comparing to SW), so Marvel Studios had much lower starting potential for reaching legendary success. However, they basically realized all of it, while SW wasted most of what it could have been.

TL;DR If Disney approached the SW franchise the same way it did with the MCU, and given the starting popularity of SW compared to previous Marvel comics and movies, SW franchise could have not only held, but even further cemented its number 1 position in current pop culture.",Unpopular Opinion: Disney Should Have Decanonized Everything Prior To 2014...

StarWars,"I've been scouring the internet for the past day and a half looking for any information about whether or nor Maul/Dooku were *both* apprentices to Sidious at the same time around the time of the Phantom Menace. I'm on my second read-through of *Dooku: Jedi Lost* and with Season 7 ending, it's on my mind. 

Quick recap of the discrepancy for anyone who needs their memory jogged \[Clone Wars Season 6: Episode 10 spoilers\]: *In ""The Lost One"" it is discovered that Sifo-Dyas was killed by the Pykes over the Oba Diah moon under orders of a man named Tyranus, under the orders of Sidious. Chancellor Valorum is the one who sent Sifo-Dyas to Oba Diah, and the file on the matter was sealed, possibly by Valorum, but most likely by Palpatine/Sidious after he became Chancellor to avoid any questions. The point is, Valorum's role indicated that everything happened before The Phantom Menace, therefore before Maul had been killed.* 

Dave Filoni has said that there does *seem* to be some kind of an error with the overlap, but different posts/interviews have indicated that it may be resolved in some way, at some point. 

So my question is, which do you all think is the most likely scenario?

**Scenario 1:** Palpatine *was* breaking the Rule of Two and had both Dooku *and* Maul as apprentices at the same time - most likely for different purposes. Maul being the more appropriate Sith Apprentice and Dooku being used (the pawn as he's referred to in the Darth Vader comics) because of his ability to assist in the creation of the Clone Wars. 

**Scenario 2:** Sifo-Dyas's death most likely happened *days* within the Invasion of Naboo and Sidious/Palpatine had moved quick and already named Dooku as a new apprentice. The ordering of Sifo-Dyas's death must have been one of his first orders as a Sith. 

**Scenario 3:** Maul was Sidious's true apprentice, but Dooku was around serving as a ""sith agent"" as opposed to being an apprentice - kind of like the Inquisitorius, Ventress being a sith assassin, etc. Sidious was keeping Dooku in reserve just in case something would happen with Maul - which it did. \*\*The Pykes, in S6:Ep10, refer to Dooku as Tyranus, ***NOT*** Darth Tyranus, so this could indicate that he wasn't a Sith apprentice yet, he wasn't a Darth.\*\* So Dooku was affiliated with Sidious, but not named his apprentice yet.

It would be kind of fulfilling to have Maul say, at some point during one of the last three episodes of Season 7, ""you replaced me! while I was still alive!"" acknowledging the fact that Sidious had already moved on to replacing him while Maul was still around. But I feel like he would have already done this, in the Son of Dathomir comic or something before now. but you know, retcons happen!

StarWars,"So, it's now been reported that Rosario Dawson is not only playing Ahsoka in The Mandalorian Season 2, but is in talks for a multiple-show deal, including a potential Ahsoka solo series. Here are two ideas for the show - particularly the main antagonists. 

So, my first idea for the main villain is a popular (currently) non-canon character that you may have heard of. His name is Galen Marek, AKA Starkiller. He was the main protagonist of the Force Unleashed duology of video games, and is a fan-favorite to this day. My idea for making him canon again is making him one of the first Inquisitors as well as Vader's secret apprentice. After the Empire falls, he seeks to accomplish what his master was trying to do: eliminate the Jedi. This would also create a cool ""apprentice vs. apprentice"" angle.

StarWars,"My Reasoning, I think Rex didn’t remove His chip yet and won’t until after Order 66. We just assumes he does because of this line “I didn’t betray my Jedi, me gregor and Wolfe all removed our control chips.” remember that line. Now the way Wolfe reacts to Kanan and how Rex deals with the situation I would say 100% Wolfe removed his after.  


 In the fives arc Giraffe lady is talking to palps and he asks will the creative thinking mess with order 66. She says no, but how does she know that, and what if she’s wrong. We do know that either Grey or Styles from the Kanan Last Padawan comic overcame the chip a while after order 66, after Celeb gave a speech about Depa Billaba. So it is possible to overcome them.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now let’s go to the Bad Batch arc, one of the main plots of that arc besides Echo being alive, is Rex and his Emotions diving him and how lose and different he is from the other clones. That’s why I think we got that arc instead of The Crystal Crisis which was definitely runner up, but I also think people voted for it because we all wanted to see the padme art in HD lets be real. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rex is definitely the most advanced clone out there, maybe besides Cut or Slick but we haven’t seen them recently so we don’t really know. Rex 100% with out a doubt had the best connection with His Jedi, and with his Jedi being Anakin Skywalker not the typical jedi emotion wise, that definitely rubbed off on Rex. That is also why we got the Padme scene Instead of the art, I don’t understand why we couldn’t of had both.. But anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is all of these have been little hints toward this, and if Rex removed his chip already we would have seen it. This does work while everything if it stick‘s true to Rex‘s statement at the beginning of this post, he never said when he removed it just that he did, and since he says he never attacked his Jedi we assumed before.

StarWars,"I’ve seen so many comments on memes and YT vids calling out force powers and typically it’s calling out Rey’s powers and it’s getting real unfair.


Star Wars powers are simple, they’re all BS: Everytime single one is when used it’s first time but the thing is before it was Rey doing it no one complained, the first mind trick - no problem, the first force pull - no problem, choke - nope, push - nope, lightning - nope, force redirect - nope, force stop - hell nah. The only difference I can ever see here is that they were all guys and that’s it. 


The argument that no one else did it so why can she doesn’t matter, dozens of Jedi have unique abilities, Ezra Bridger has a force connection to animals, Cal Kestis has similar but he can feel the history of objects, Plo Koon could use a unique light side lightning. Every force user has the potential for unique abilities, Rey’s is healing. I do still feel that her sudden badassery in TFW is not well explained enough, it’s only in the novelisation that’s you know when she resisted Ben’s mind invasion she went into his mind and in doing so saw all his Jedi and also Sith training. Don’t say her powers don’t make sense when nobody’s powers make sense.


Sometimes you see complaints about Luke’s projection ability but that seems to get excused because he is Luke Skywalker but it’s the same situation he is just the first onscreen appearance. Also people that say Palpatine’s force storm is ridiculous, yeah it kinda is but you’re arguing that space wizards shouldn’t be able to do what wizards in fantasy can do my mixing the right crap. Some may argue well he is Luke Skywalker the biggest baddest Jedi to live with that good chosen one blood but Rey has the literal baddest blood around with the capability to ultimately turn away from the dark side that for sure pulls hard.


Star Wars is an enjoyable space Oprah, when you see a new force thing don’t get angry and heated give it a good old fashioned dad ‘cool ‘. Arguing something doesn’t make sense it a sci-fi fantasy universe where space whales can do FTL manoeuvres and a young guy can survive being struck with enough lightning to power NYC is like trying to empty a sea with a bucket, pointless and ultimately stupid.

StarWars," I think we can all agree that neither timeline is wholly consistent. There are golden spots and there is garbage. What do you think Legends handled better than Canon? What about the opposite?

Legends over Canon:

\-The Han Solo Trilogy is far better than the Solo movie, imo. This might be an unfair comparison as they're both vastly different in aim and ambition. One tries to tell whole Han's life story, the good and the bad. The other is a fun sci-fi romp. However, I really adored Han's treatment in the novels. It showed how you could humanize a character without removing a character's mystique. We get the classic origin story ""fill in the blanks"" style storytelling, but it's done naturally. It almost felt like a sci-fi Name of the Wind. Solo makes it seem like everything important to Han Solo happened on one trip. The movie ends up feeling like a filmed wookiepedia page.

Canon over Legends:

\-This might be controversial, but I prefer Luke's ultimate fate in canon. Star Wars has always been like a modern myth. Lucas always went for mythic resonance in the PT and OT. There's nothing more mythic than the story of a hero who is initially burdened by his own legend and what it represents, a hero who comes to terms with that legend, and then finally transcends it. Luke's final scene in TLJ is one of my all time favorites. The man who uses his personal myth to inspire the rest of the galaxy, one last time. Post ROTJ Luke in Legends initially seemed like a very human figure, heroic and flawed. However, he started to feel like a RPG character after a while. Guy just got more and more OP, but grew more and more distant as a character. Any attempts at real character development (which did happen often) seemed to be temporary. There's some beautiful Luke material post ROTJ, especially in the bantam era and NJO, but I'd argue that the Luke we finally say farewell to in Crucible is the exact same individual we left in ROTJ.",What events or characters had a stronger portrayal in Canon over Legends? What about the opposite?
StarWars,"**A fateful night**

The vision just wouldn’t leave her mind, her son laying in darkness and vanishing at the end of her Jedi path. 

“Leia, the future is always in motion.” Luke had said those farm boy eyes filled with certainty “You can’t be sure that what you saw will happen, remember what I told about cloud city? What set my vision in motion was my own decision to leave Dagobah“. Maybe he was right, leaving Luke would start the path that would led to her vision, but that was not what she was feeling.

Now sitting alone in her quarters on Ajan Kloss she was certain of what her vision meant, but not certain of what she should do.

“Trust your feelings, Leia.” a voice came from the Force, but not Obi Wan or Yoda this was someone new and as she look to her window where the white light of the night was entering and a tall long haired Jedi was standing there a soft blue glow surrounding him, a scar marking his face, her birth father Anakin Skywalker. Luke had told her about seeing their father as Force Ghost, but she wasn’t ready. She still remembered him as Darth Vader, the monster that tortured her on the Death Star, the villain who killed so many of her friends and yet she felt nothing but warm and good feelings coming from him now.

“I am not ready for this, not now.” She said only them realizing the tears pooling in her eyes.

“I… I have something to tell you, the story of when your mo… when Padme told me she was pregnant” Anakin was nervous to talk to her, could a Force Ghost get nervous? Obi Wan and Yoda always seemed so calm. But perhaps he was measuring words because he felt what she was feeling, her fear of what he had become in life. “I was so happy, but she was always the responsible one and reminded me that she was a Senator and I was a Jedi, my commitment with the Order forbade me from having attachments, a wife, children, a family. I was born a slave and the Jedi became my freedom, but as a found love the Jedi became my prison. I found propose on being a Jedi, but I wanted nothing more than to leave the order and be a husband and a father, but I had a vision.” 

Leia heart stoped, Anakin wanted to leave the Order? She remembered the holos her father shown her from the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker was a hero to the Republic, the face of the Jedi Order for the people, ever child in the core worlds had known about Skywalker and Kenobi, before the Empire forbade any Jedi “propaganda”, but even at the height of his power as a Jedi he wanted to leave?

“I saw Padme dying in childbirth, in my overconfidence I thought only power could save her so I let myself be seduced by the dark side. I wasn’t strong enough learn a lesson from my apprentice”

“Ahsoka?“ The name escaped Leia’s lips without her knowing.

“You knew her during the Rebellion, when she was wrongly accused of bombing the Jedi temple the Jedi left her to be judged guilty by the Republic, after she cleared her name, she wasn’t angry with the Jedi, she was disappointed and she did what I couldn’t she left the only life she knew and left the Order.” His eyes where full of pride as he talked about Ahsoka. “You have that strength too Leia, if the Force and your heart are telling you to be a mother to your son, you should listen and be stronger than I was.” He held up his hand as if he wanted to touch her, tear now where rolling down her face.

“Leia, I…” 

“I know.”

Anakin smiled “I like Han, you will be happy together.” and vanished with the wind that blew from the window. 

She knew what she had to do and she knew she had the strength to do it.","After Listing to The Rise of Skywalker audiobook I felt the need to write this, I hope you all like it."

But in my opinion this less than 15 second duel was undeniably meaningful but to say it was a good fight is also untrue. I think it wouldve been nice for them to duel for at least a minute or so. It would still show Obi wans wisdom but also provide a better fight scene. They built up maul and Obi wans meeting and it did not seem like a climax at all. If you say well it is good due to the meeting just imagine this. Say after all the lead up to palpatine in the OT, Luke defeats Vader instantly and turns and defeats palpatine as well. Even if he did it with the help of Vader many would feel cheated on lack of action.

StarWars,"I really only came up with this idea in the last hour for no real reason but I want to know where anyone stands on the absolute last shot of Clone Wars or general feelings that the episode/series should end on. 

My own opinion is that even with Maul, Rex, and Ahsoka together escaping Mandalore, along with anyone that isn’t a clone or hasn’t been de-chipped, it should feel absolutely bleak. Like there’s no chance anything could ever be the same. In a sense I want it to be crushing. 

The music from RotS where the Jedi are getting taken out is rising, maybe even just above being loud where it resonates inside, they cut to similar shots from the movie or add more to it and it’s just feels like the end. And that’s when it cuts to credits end of clone wars. We don’t need to know anything more. Rebels mentions enough to form a picture and I just feel like that hopeless ending is so perfect for how it’s supposed to be. 

At the bare minimum we shouldn’t get a happy ending or one of hope. I hope those two suggestions are what happens as I don’t know if they would want to make people feel dead inside but I really want that lol.

While I don’t think the prequels are anywhere near as good as the original trilogy, I’ve consistently enjoyed every Yoda scene in all six movies so far.

StarWars,"""Flying is for *droids*."" - Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, circa 19 BBY

Any hardcore Star Wars fan or hardcore prequel memer knows that Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi as a particular distaste for the piloting of starships. But why? Well, after reading *Master &amp; Apprentice* by Claudia Gray, I believe the answer has been revealed. \[Spoilers for *Master &amp; Apprentice A*head\]

*""As Qui-Gon well knew, Obi-Wan* loved *flying.""* 

Near the beginning of the story, Gray references several times Obi-Wan Kenobi's love of flying starcraft. However, this contradicts what we know about him in Episodes II &amp; III, so I was interested to see what Gray would do to change Obi-Wan's mind so drastically.

First, Obi-Wan discovers a possible replacement for flying: riding. During a scene in which he must participate in a royal hunt on the planet Pijal, Obi-Wan falls in love with riding a varactyl, which is clever foreshadowing (preshadowing? preforeshadowing?) referencing his fight with General Grievous almost 20 years later. 

However, what truly spins Obi-Wan's view is the climax of the story, in which he is residing in the cockpit of a fighter called the *Facet,* which he was completely unfamiliar with. Obi-Wan recognizes hostile droids come into the hangar, and powers up the craft and blasts them. However, he is unable to, well, turn the thing off. I'll let this excerpt speak for itself.

*""'You flew* through the ship's corridors?' *Qui-Gon put one arm around Obi-Wan's shoulders as they walked away from the corvette's docking bay. ..... Obi-Wan still appeared to be in shock. 'It was terrible,' he said, his eyes staring fixedly ahead. 'I don't want to fly again.* Ever*.'*

'*Oh, come now, Padawan.'*

'*I* hate *flying.""*",Why Obi-Wan Kenobi Hates Flying
StarWars,"I personally dont think the script is all that great. Especially the whole Rey and poe kiss for no reason. It even more out of plafe than reylo. At least the story respect and carry on the last jedi storyline and give each characters an arcs. Like Fin arcs in duel of fate is honestly one of the best thing they could have given him due to becoming a defective stormtrooper. And since Phasma is alive in that script have him and phasma clash one final time big climate. Focus on story of loyalty vs doing what is right.

They could have revamp carrie fisher story or kill her offscreen and nobody would blame them due to Carrie fisher unfortunate timing death (with that being said I will give credit for JJ for trying to honor Leia death).

And Hux story was far more interesting than both TFA and TlJ

Honestly this could have estbalish this sequel as one consistent trilogy that is its own thing and not depend on the skywalker 

And I would like to remind you disney only call this the skywalker saga AFTER Rise of Skywalker trailee released. It very clear they never plan for this to be skywalker saga in the beginning. 

And the ending of Duel of Fate is just a great ending for Rey.

One of the thing that I dislike about JJ movies is that he repeated characters arcs and never have them grow. You can look at video about Patrick Willem call solving JJ mystery box and see for yourself. 

Essentially for a story that have no ending, character that end up same place before. We ses this in end of RoS.

Rey end up alone in another desert like planet literally the same place she begin when journey start. Luke at the end of journey end up with his friend and those he loved. 

In duel of fate, Rey end up in a beautiful lush green planet with other force sensitive. There is also Fin and Poe who are both her friend accompanied her. Showing she is no longet alone and she end up at different place

I click on the video and at first I was all excited but then I realized some of the footage was already used.

StarWars,"So I just watched the first 6 episodes in which I noticed following: 

1, episodes are unnecessarily long. There is just so many useless walking and pauses in dialogues. Each episode could be 10mins shorter if it were not for this. 

2, Story moves too sluggish. Like seriously, the whole plot of first 6 episodes which I watched could be summarised in 10 sentences and could fit into 2-3 episodes. Most screen time of all episodes just feels like fillers. As I said above, the unnecessary walking, dialogues etc... 

3. Even the main hero, Mando, doesn’t seem like a legendary bounty hunter. He gets his ass beaten several times throughout the episodes and if it weren’t for his armor he would have been dead by now. 

Now I realise I haven’t seen all the episodes but I doubt that whatever happens in them changes the whole show so drastically that I’d change my whole perspective on the show. I will watch them in order to finish the season but I’m not sure iI’ll watch the next season. 

Also the only positive I found about the show was the visuals which are amazing. Also baby Yoda, he’s cute af.

StarWars,"I personally didn’t mind them bringing back Palpatine for several reasons. For one, I honestly don’t know if you can beat Palpatine. Two, I love Ian Ian McDiarmid as him and I don’t think you can properly wrap up the Skywalker saga without Palpatine. And George Lucas is the one who suggested to bring back Palpatine in the EU in the first place so it’s not like he hates the idea or anything. Perhaps the biggest is that it’s very strange to have six movies in your saga with him as the overall head villain and then for the next three have someone else. I don’t know it just seems so displaced from the other six in my opinion, and wouldn’t feel right considering had SUCH a big part in the previous six episodes. 

That being said, I completely despise and hate the way they actually did it in the movie. It’s obviously not planned, and they offer basically no explanation as to how he’s here now, and on top of that he doesn’t even have that much time in the movie. And the way he gets defeated is so anti climactic. He could have worked if maybe Anakin was in the movie(he should have been there anyway), and maybe he somehow lead to Palpatine getting defeated again. I know it’s a stretch but I’m sure an actual writer could come up with something that’d work. It’d also work much better if he was revealed to have orchestrated everything at the end of episode 8, could have been a very cool twist in my opinion.

StarWars,"For those of us with experience with the old EU, a thought about how to get a deeper view of Ahsoka. 

The novel ""I, Jedi"" was not just a good read. It was an effective storytelling device that wove together events for a number of other books, showing them from a completely different perspective. That being a character who was far more essential to those events than we had realized. 

Same could be done with Ahsoka. There are myriad reasons we may not have seen her during the OT and sequel trilogies. Did she distract the rest of the bounty hunters in ESB so our heroes only had to deal with Fett? Perhaps she assisted the Bothan spies in stealing the plans for the second Death Star. Why didn't we see more of the Knights of Ren? Was Ahsoka responsible, keeping them occupied and at bay so they couldn't come at Rey and Co? Did she Obi Wan in his adventures, or have him help her on a mission or two...?

The possibilities are endless and  if done effectively, can explain why we never saw Ahsoka and how she impacted galactic events as an integral, yet indirect player.",An idea for Ahsoka moving forward...
StarWars,"TRoS is a controversial film that has drawn a lot of criticism from the Star Wars fanbase. While I personally enjoyed the film, I'm not making this post to defend it in it's entirety. Rather, there is one criticism that is often repeated, which I intend to refute:

**Palpatine being alive cheapens, lessens, or entirely negates Anakin sacrificing himself to destroy him.**

Though, admittedly, the film makes no effort to support these arguments explicitly, there are two reasons why that criticism is inaccurate, and why Palplatine being alive has either a neutral or positive effect on Anakin's sacrifice:

**1.** **The point of Anakin's sacrifice wasn't to kill the Emperor; it was to save Luke**

Vader's last act in RotJ accomplishes two things; it kills the Emperor, and it saves Luke. Palpatine surviving in TRoS means he only accomplished the latter. This has upset people, as they see it weakening the point of his sacrifice. But why does it matter if Palpatine is permanently dead? Why is Anakin's great act of redemption contingent upon killing the Emperor? Remember, Vader wanted to kill him as far back as ESB. In true Sith fashion, he wanted to kill his master and turn Luke to the dark side as his new apprentice. Look at it like this:

**What Vader wanted in ESB**: Kill Palpatine, turn Luke to the dark side, live forever

**What Anakin accomplished in his RotJ redemption**: Kill Palpatine, save Luke after embracing the light side, and die

In both scenarios, he kills Palpatine, but what changes is the *why.* Rather than killing him to overthrow him and take his place, he kills him to save his son at the cost of his own life. It's the *why* that shows Anakin's redemption. The Jedi returned, he sacrificed his own life to save the life of an innocent. If he was motivated by the goal of *killing* Palpatine, there is no growth or redemption. If he was motivated by *stopping* Palpatine from torturing and killing his son, and motivated so much so that his own life is willingly given in the process, then there is growth and redemption. He redeemed himself by acting like a Jedi, not a Sith

**2. The chosen one prophecy was bullshit**

This is a shorter point, and it's simply that the whole ""chosen one, bring balance to the Force, etc."" prophecy was always bullshit. ""A prophecy misread could have been"" or whatever Yoda said sums it up. There are so many ways to interpret it that it's essentially meaningless. The Jedi held onto it as an idea to feel like they still knew what was going to happen, to still feel like they understood the Force. But the whole point of the prequels was that the Jedi were so up their asses that they didn't notice their elected leader was a fucking Sith lord. Their powers had weakened. They were so obsessed with their own dogma that they never even questioned Anakin being immaculately conceived. A Sith Lord created a perfect dark apprentice literally out of thin air, and the Jedi are just like ""chosen one, bring balance to the Force."" Yeah, they don't want to train him at first, but because of their age restrictions, not because of common sense. 

All this is to say that the Jedi reliance on a vague and meaningless prophecy was bullshit and expecting Anakin to literally bring balance to the Force (whatever that means) detracts from the actual human element of his sacrifice.

**Tl;dr: Anakin sacrificed himself to save Luke, not permanently destroy the Emperor, and there was no prophecy dictating that he do so.**",The Rise of Skywalker and Anakin's Sacrifice- A Defense
StarWars,"During the quarantine, I've been showing my fiance a lot of movies I enjoy. We watched most of the Marvel movies over the last three weeks and now we are doing Star Wars. After watching The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones all the way through for the first time in a few years... woof. Those two are just... okay. I don't hate them, but I didn't love it. Revenge of the Sith is so good even in comparison to the rest of the Star Wars movies, but the first two in the prequels just aren't that good. Half the time, I had to explain to my fiance the importance of the politics in the movies. Being a Star Wars fan for most of my life, I know what's going on and have done so much research and watched a million youtube videos about Star Wars, so for me it all made sense. But for her, as someone who has only seen the sequels, the politics and back story of what is going on was not clear to her. I think back as a kid I really had no idea either, I just enjoyed the spectacle of all the effects and action. 

All that being said, I have gained a new respect for the sequels. While I was able to enjoy The Rise of Skywalker, even after a few viewings, I found it hard to enjoy The Phantom Menace, aside from the Pod Racing and the Maul duel. Same applies for Attack of the Clones, easier to watch than TPM, but still just tough at times. My fiance has seen the sequels, but she wanted to watch the other 6 because she wanted to see them all. She commented to me that no one should ever say the sequels are bad after watching the gungan army versus the droid army in TPM. I couldn't disagree with her. I love the prequels and love that era, but the movies are a tough watch if you're not a fully invested fan. The only movie she said she enjoyed from the prequels was Revenge of the Sith, which is totally fair. The re watch has just shown me that maybe we should give Disney more credit than we do. Though there are major gripes with the sequels, they're at least pretty good movies. Overall, I'd say the sequels are better, but of all the 6 prequel/sequel movies, Revenge of the Sith is the superior movie. 

Sorry for being so long winded, but after my first re watch in a few years of the Prequels, I had to let my pride go and recognize that Disney is on the right path, it might have just taken a few sputters to get in the right direction.",The Prequels (a rewatch with someone who's never seen them)
StarWars,"If you remember the Mortis arc in TCW season 3, the Father represented the force, the Daughter represented the light side and the Son represented the dark side. The father brought the chosen one (Anakin) to bring balance because the son was getting too powerful and planned to leave Mortis. While they were there, all three Mortis gods died. First the daughter, then the son and finally the father. When Anakin left, the force was balanced because all three Mortis force-gods were dead and none of them could grow too powerful and leave Mortis to wreak havoc on the rest of the galaxy.

Therefore, Anakin was the chosen one after all even though Palpy apparently survived RotJ, because the prophecy was never ABOUT destroying the Sith. The Jedi in all of their ignorance twisted it to be about that. In reality, according to my friend who came up with this, the prophecy was ACTUALLY about destroying the Mortis gods and preventing them from escaping the way the Son was trying to do.",New theory on the chosen one prophecy my friend came up with:

The way the commandos interact with one another and their language interplay is amazing.  I, also, like how the Arc Troopers are from Kal Skirata's parentage.  You can see so many differences in each of the clones and how they adapt their Mando trained culture into everyday life.  

Does anyone have any other books that treat Mandalorian culture the same, or go into greater depth?",Karen Traviss novels and Mando culture
StarWars,"I've been watching some stuff about DID and I wonder if that's what happened with Vader.  
DID is triggered by heavy trauma. To sum it up, it happens when the trauma is way too strong for the victim to actually deal with it. Accompanied with extreme stress and emotional inarticulation, (which are both induced by his Jedi training,ironically enough) it may lead to complete conscious dissociation.  
2 things lead me to this hypothesis : clues in the story and the way Vader's personality mirrors Anakin's.  
My clues are in Rebels,during his encounter/fight with Ahsoka and in Return of the Jedi,when Luke verbally confronts Vader.  
In Rebels, when Ahsoka appears before him, he doesn't talk to her as if he ever knew her,rather as if he knows of her from somebody else's memories. He also constantly refers to Anakin as another person and claimed that he destroyed him since he was weak.  
But the most direct clue,to me, is right after Vader took Ahsoka's blow to his mask.  
Not only does he call her by her first name, but responds (physically at least) to being called Anakin. He then looks down in shame,and then Vader takes over.  


In ROTJ, not only can Luke sense the conflict inside of his father,but the audience also can. I think this whole scene is Anakin being himself.He reacts to his on name in almost a childish way,very much like he could have done in AOTC. ""You don't know the power of the Dark Side"" is a warning. Not only does it sound like one,but it's also indicated by the context. The way he handles Luke's lightsaber and comments on it is a sign of how proud of his son he is and obviously,the line ""it is too late for me,son"" speaks for itself.We can also argue that ""Son"" used this way sounds rather affectionate,especially coming from the OG ""not the men,but the women and children too"" youngling killer . And only on Luke's second discussion with him,mind you.  


But most importantly, why do I identify Vader as an alter ?  
I think that Vader is Anakin's psyche's response to his own utter failure. He's responsible for the destruction of the Republic, lost all of his friends, got heavily mutilated by his former mentor,ended up being pretty much Palpatine's slave, and he didn't even reach the goal he was trying to attain by doing all of that : Saving Padme. All he has is his anger,his hate,and the Dark Side.  
Where Anakin was emotionally eruptive, Vader is composed.  
Where Anakin was sometimes impulsive and spontaneous, Vader is incredibly calculating.  
Where Anakin lacked repartee, Vader is, like, the sassiest guy in the galaxy,just look at his punchlines.  
Where Anakin believed in defending the weak, Vader claims he destroyed Anakin because he was weak.

So,what do you guys think ?",[DISCUSSION] Did Anakin suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder ?
StarWars,"As we all know, despite the disappointment of the sequel trilogy and the mediocrity of the prequels, the star wars universe has still captured our imaginations. So I pose a question. Why do you, people of reddit, think the original trilogy succeeded while the other trilogies did not? By success, I am referring to rating, fan love, or the general opinion of the trilogy. NOT the profit. The original trilogy is seen as this amazing story that is highly rated and it popularized the name ""star wars"" while the other 2 trilogies are seen as not even half of what the original was. So why do you think it succeeded? because of George Lucas, the time period, the story, etc. I personally believed the original trilogy succeeded because George Lucas wrote it as one movie instead of 3 (then he changed it to 3 because it was way too damn long), as said in the documentary ""Empire of dreams.""

StarWars,"... if you consider TROS needed saving.  Honestly, I enjoyed it.  Yes, there are a lot of plot issues, but...

There are like 3000 hours of youtube contents on those already, and I am 1/10000 as eloquent as they are, so you can go ahead and watch those videos instead.

But rather, I was just thinking, if there's one thing I really didn't like about the ending, it's how it felt rushed... almost like... well, Rey killed Palapatine, nothing left to do, so... so off screen action... and millions of abducted children are now dead.  Thanks Obama.

But that weird LOTR Ghost Save moment could have been saved, had they simply kept Hux alive.

Think about the issues that could have been resolved:

1: And I know this is a huge one; ships can't fly up.  Well, as it turns out, the fleet is in huge disarray because of a saboteur... Hux!  

2: Imperial star destroyers aren't just being LOTR Ghosted, they can actually put up a good fight (enhance story tension), but it's with Hux and his new found conscience to freed the imprisoned mind of abducted children, half of the final order ships defected and won the final battle.

3. Hux get to have his redemption quirky one-liner moment for whatever he could say for finally ruining Kylo's plan.  (Which I kinda felt like the film was moving toward until Pryde killed him for no reason)

4. Continuing off of point 2, you give a lot of weight to the abducted children issue.  Cause right now, it's like... no empathy for killing millions of abducted children.  So keeping Hux as a conduit for redeeming a lot of these kids seems to me like a lot more meaningful then simply killing them all.  I mean, the trilogy kept trying to push the theme of ""awakening"" and how Lando's hypothetical children can turn back from being brainwashed.  So it's actually very uncomfortable to think that none of those million of other kids are redeemable, what if a lot more of them can wake up too?

It's just kind of my view how at least some of the complaints people have with TROS can be resolved with simply keeping Hux alive.  (At the very least, a little longer... like, not dead until final battle kind of thing)  I do understand however, that you don't want to credit too much of the rebel success to a former villain.  I kinda feel there's still ways to execute it so that even if that's really what's going on in the background, cinematically, you still give more weight to rebels with more screen time, like the movie in its current state now.  What do you guys think?",Hux's death is a waste and could have saved TROS
StarWars,"In my opinion, with no death threats wanted. I believe Disney saved Star Wars. I love ROTS, but I think George Lucas did not have interest in Episodes 1 and 2, he just wanted ROTS to be made. Which did work out for that movie. But the sequel trilogy has been very good in my opinion. (Nothing like the originals of course.) 7 is great, 8 is probably the most okay you can get, and I really loved 9. I also think it's much easier to be a Star Wars fan now with all the games, shows, and even spin off movies. The Disney+ program has been centered around Star Wars, with Mandalorian being a work of art.",Disney's Star Wars- Discussion
StarWars,"The next lightsaber duel we get to see will be between characters we’ve never seen or heard of. Unless it’s one between Ahsoka and Moff Gideon but I doubt the mandalorian will go there in season 2. (Rosario Dawson’s Ahsoka is only being cast as a guest star so I would not get your hopes up bc she will probably show up at the very end of season 2 the same way the dark saber was revealed)

The rebels sequel may have lightsaber duels but from the rumors it won’t be light VS dark. 

It’s so crazy that we may not see another red lightsaber vs. green, blue white etc. ...maybe ever. 

The ending of clone wars is prolly gonna be the best payoff Star Wars fans have ever got. The shame of it is the Ahsoka arc and how it wasn’t exactly great. It’s a shame bc of quarantine, the show prolly got extra viewers but that Ahsoka arc didn’t exactly hook anyone, as far as I’m concerned. 

It sucks bc the really good clone wars episodes that focus on the actual war have been amazing since about halfway through season 3 (with the mon Cari - water world arc being an exception bc it sucked lol)

I don’t know why or what they were thinking with some of these silly filler episodes. The siege of mandalore could have easily been 12 episodes with every episode ending on a cliffhanger and viewers would have come running, imo.",After the duel between Ahsoka and Maul we may not see another lightsaber duel for 24-36 mos or longer.
StarWars,So Disney + recently got released in my country and I watched the show thoroughly except the last season which I will get around watching later. What I noticed is that isn't he supposed to be the master of Soresu and have impenetrable defence? Except the Maul and undercover bounty hunter arc he seemed quite useless because the other jedi did have cool fighting sequences and would get shit done. He keeps getting beat up by non force users and force users alike. Him getting beaten up by Dooku is fine as he is a smart motherfucker likr Obi Wan himself but why isn't he able to outsmart normal adversaries?,Why is Obi Wan so weak in the Clone Wars show?
StarWars,"No spoilers but man that filler arc really sucked. I had heard everyone complaining about it but I figured it wouldn’t be that bad. Idk why Disney would give us this arc or those terrible characters it almost hilariously makes zero sense especially considering there was so many other cool and interesting storylines to explore. 

Hell I would’ve preferred a filler arc that further explored Ashoka and Lux Bonteri’s relationship. That would’ve been so cool then working together while she’s outside the jedi order. And they already have history. Even if you’re not a romance fan that was juicy shit when she actually developed feelings for him and Anakin said he understood how she felt. 

Almost anything would’ve been better than what they gave us. This stings worse than the prequels because we pretty much expected those to be bad but not this... anyway the latest episode was truly amazing so there’s that.",Late to the party.

StarWars,"Just watched episode IX.   
Good job guys, good job, but there is only one main problem. The movie is not ""original"". Like all the sequels, there is nothing new added to the circus. Speeder chasing, a training course, the decision to leave training while not ready, the temptation of the dark side, the final epic battle where Palpatine laugh in the face of the poor jedi alone who must surrender to the dark side, a travel inside a star destroyer that \*looks exactly like a death star interior\*, a sand planet, the mad return to the remote island of the gone master (this was sick), the vision of the ghost master that fix the poor jedi.

And after all of this, after episode 4 remake, after that trash randomly ordinated episode 5 remake, after a Marvelish like useless ending with a lot of sparks but zero emotions, all this good people ripped off one of the greatest ending in all movies, the two suns of Tatooine of Episode 3.   


Why?   
1 Star Wars's father is George Lucas. .

2 They didnt want George Lucas.  


3 They wanted to make money, so they copied what George Lucas did, 40 years ago, in hope to make another masterwork. They made money, the did a work, not a masterwork. 

4 I felt more emotions in the opening of episode 7 (Finn, the landing and kylo Ren) than the ending of episode 9 (wich is random events until the goods win)   


5 I've seen Lost by JJ Abrams, it's far more original than this movies. You had your chance pal, maybe you did a lot of money, but i loved you for being a pioneer, not a copycat.

StarWars,"I’ve always been under the impression that ROTS takes place over the course of at least 4 months. When Palme tells Anakin she is pregnant, there is hardly a bump. Throughout the movie, she gradually gets larger and larger. Anakin’s turn obviously truly started with the death of his mother, and then rapidly progressed from the start of ROTS, with the premonitions of Padme’s death. Everything that happens after that just catalyzes his turn. It seems unlikely that he totally turns over the course of just a couple days or even hours. It’s hard to tell that the movie takes place over that span of several months though, because you’re constantly jumping between planets, all at different times of day &amp; night. I feel the same about Ep.II. I think Anakin and Padme has several weeks to a month to fall in love on Naboo. He obv. felt strongly about her since Ep. I, but she must’ve take at LEAST a few months to develop a serious love for him.

StarWars,Disney+ is going to eventually launch the “What if?...” marvel series... I thought it would be super cool to adapt that same idea into the Star Wars universe. It would be a fun way to introduce new stories as well as old EU stories into “legends” like stories which I feel like would be a fun thing if each episode was opened by like a tribe of people being told a story by an elder of that tribe or stories being told at a cantina. Just the stories told by people across the universe with discrepancies and differences as part of the stories. It could bring back characters from all across the Star Wars time and space as well as actors to voice them. Thoughts?,Star Wars: Legends
StarWars,"Yeah obviously they aren't the prequels with their intense fast motion that looks almost dance like (which I love and have their place) but the duels in the sequels aren't trying to be that. The Jedi order has been dead for over half a century and the only formally trained character, kylo Ren/Ben solo, stopped his training as a Padawan. And Rey's use of a lightsaber ""like a baseball bat"" makes sense because the only meme weapon she has used was her staff. I understand not liking the sequels story but could someone please explain the hate for the fights?(especially in IX because did you even see Ben vs the KoR)",Why Do people hate the lightsaber fights in the sequels?
StarWars,"The light side wins in every movie. Right there off the bat you’re fundamentally misunderstanding the franchise. In the first 6 movies the light side wins on some occasions and the darkside wins on other. That’s what makes both of those wins meaningful. If one wins every time it’s meaningless just like it is in the sequels. There are no stakes. You never buy the first order are actually a big deal, no matter how much you fabricate it you cannot earn evil greatness without them actually succeeding on occasion. Kylo Ren had so much potential, Adam driver an amazing actor did SO MUCH with what he was given but he can only do so much to be a supervillain, the script has to support him. Rey BEATING HIM in the forest when he’s basically fully trained and she’s NOT EVEN TRAINED AT ALL, NOT TRAINED, NOT TRAINED. This is one of the biggest insults in the entire franchise because you play up a character with smoke and mirrors (make him look and sound like a badass powerful villain) but then completely destroy that character when it’s time for actions. He loses when she’s untrained but then is better than her in rise of the skywalker when she is. The sequels would have made much more sense if he beats her in the forest, the badass moment of him killing Han Solo isn’t taken away, HE WINS at the end of the force awakens. Then she goes training. And THEN her win would have been so much sweeter.

This all stems from the same problem the end of Game of thrones had. Hollywood is afraid to let the bad guy win sometimes, they think the heroes need plot armor all the time but they don’t, they think they can’t go through trials and tribulations but they NEED to. There has to be stakes, there has to be real losses to make the wins real.",The biggest problem with the sequels
StarWars,"I didn’t finish reading the Ahsoka novel, but this has been bugging me.

Togrutas are carnivores, but Ahsoka manages to eat the rations that Kaeden gave her on Raada.

Raada is a hugely agricultural planet, and according to the book: They make their own rations, they have lots of farms, and Ahsoka notices while “hiking” that there aren’t a lot of animals worth hunting for meat. 

Kaeden gave her rations as a reward for fixing her thresher, and Ahsoka even says that it could last her a month or more (implying all of them were possible for Ahsoka to eat) and that food was no problem on that planet because they made everything themselves. 


There are questions of mine regarding this interaction:

Ahsoka notices meat isn’t in big supply on the planet, but that is the only type of thing she can really eat (it is specifically said on wookipedia that togrutas are carnivores not omnivores). How would there be abundant meat-based rations? 
- I am not saying there are NO meat rations, but it cant be in abundant supply for a carnivore on a planet that is mainly only known for plant based agriculture. 

Even then, how’d Kaeden know to bring only meat based rations, or know Togrutas are carnivores (since she was just a farmer, and Togrutas were very tribal and discouraged individuality [they werent wanderers])? 
Ahsoka and her barely had any interactions prior to bringing the rations, so I doubt Ahsoka told her, and I doubt Kaeden even had known many Togrutas before (to know if they were carnivores).

My main point is meat isn’t as common as plant-based food there, so Kaeden would have had to cater specifically to her, but it would be unlikely she even knew Ahsoka’s diet.

It is very nit-picky, I know. I was just curious.

Instead of confronting Vader, or helping the Rebels, she just does nothing for the rest of her life. What is the big deal with Luke at the time if there are better Jedi still alive who could've done better than him? Ahsoka literally threw away years, decades even, of being dedicated to helping people to just hide in her cloak with a staff because  Rebels is too much of a kids show to kill characters. And its not like she does anything good later. In the Rise of Skywalker, you hear her voice, implying she is dead, leaving her a wasted character all because of a stupid decision in Rebels.

StarWars,"Since Mando S1 has been over for a few months, I wanted to look back at it and get some of your opinions on the season as a whole. Understanding what the show is now, how did you feel about the first 3 episodes being plot-driven, the middle three being more episodic in nature, where Mando does random odd-jobs around the galaxy, and finally the last two episodes returning to the initial plot that was set up in the first three episodes? 

(I personally think they weren’t for no reason. I believe it’s very very possible each story told within those episodes could bring future complications for the Mando again. *looking at you, shady man *COUGH BOBA FETT* cough in boots at the end of episode....5 or 6, I forget). 

Do you think those episodes were a waste of time? Do you wish episodes that furthered the main plot line replaced those middle three stories? Basically would you have preferred 8 plot-driven episodes?

At the time of their releases, I enjoyed seeing Mando going about the galaxy doing whatever he wanted, but I did thirst for more of the main story involving Baby Yoda, but now I’m glad Lucasfilm/Favreau and Filoni did what they did. I have 10000% trust in those two men.  

I guess polls aren’t allowed on this sub so start your reply off with one of these three options:

1. Yes! I liked it. It’s nice to see what’s going on in the galaxy and get a view of day-to-day life for not just the mando, but bounty hunters and your everyday-characters as well.

2. No I didn’t enjoy it. I wish they did 8 story-driven episodes and cut out the western-like episodic crap!

StarWars,"I just rewatched 7, which I love.  I remember watching it for the 1st time and truly feeling an awakening of my childhood inspiration from A New Hope.  I know, it's perfect and it parallels IV in a bit much.  

However, I left the theater just waiting to see what would happen next.   As the camera circled around Luke and Rey with lightsaber extended it was an amazing feeling.  Pretty sweet....

Yet it was incredibly bitter, as I remember my initial feelings when Luke grabbed the light saber and chucked it and so began the downward spiral, for me.  Enough said I guess.  I know this has been discussed but I'm just expressing my own reflection.  I just lament what could have been.  

Peace.  May the force be with you.","Episode VII, So bittersweet..."
StarWars,"First of all, I loved the force unleashed games, I played both of them a lot and was a big fan of how quite frankly badass they made you feel. That being said, looking back, I can't help but look back and think that starkiller is a lot less interesting of a character than the fandom makes him out to be. The only things about him that I can see as interesting are 1) his level of power and the feats this enables him to achieve (yes him bringing down a star destroyer has become a meme at this point!) and 2) the conflict of his character.

With point one, I really don't know how you'd implement him back into canon in a way that is justified within the story it's being told in. I've heard the suggestion of making him an inquisitor, however we know in canon that they are trained in a way so that their levels of power are limited, to keep them in check with Vader, so this wouldn't hold up. Furthermore, the reason this power is interesting in TFU is because you get to control it, sure watching it on screen would be cool, but it wouldn't come with any sort of depth. 

Now onto my second point, I don't think Starkiller is a completely disinteresting character, but at the very least, all the ways in which his character are interesting have already been done in canon, and a lot better than that. Examples of this would be Kylo Ren and his struggle with the light and dark that was portrayed beautifully by Adam Driver. My point being that I think he'd end up feeling like an amalgamation of other canon characters.

As much as I enjoy(ed) TFU games, I don't think Starkiller has a place in canon, least not this late after so much as been re established so differently.",Unpopular opinion but I don't think Starkiller should be re-canonized.

Why I ask: I was too young when the prequels were first released, but they've really grown on me over the years. Actually I don't know if I disliked them at any time. Of course I realise they're flawed, I think it doesn't have to be explained what's wrong with them, but I was just asking myself if I like them so much more compared to the sequels because of nostalgia, or because I like the idea that it's still the original vision of George Lucas... That's why I want to hear opinions from people who disliked the prequels when they first came out and who have since changed their minds.",How do you think the sequels will age compared to the prequels?
StarWars,"In The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine's ultimate goal is for Rey to kill him so that he can transfer his spirit into her.

However, one implication of this scene is that it retcons Palpatine and Luke's interactions in Return of the Jedi. During the throne room scene, Palpatine goads Luke into killing him. Up until TRoS, it has been generally understood that this is Palpatine's attempt to sway Luke to the dark side. After TRoS, we now know that Palpatine's PRIMARY goal in this scene must actually have been to transfer his spirit into Luke, just as he did with Rey.

Why do we know this to be true? New canon material (TRoS Expanded Edition) establishes that, when Vader threw him over the ledge, he used the same knowledge he attempts to use on Rey in TRoS to transfer his spirit from his falling body to a clone of himself on Exegol. This information tell us that he already had the knowledge to take over Luke's body by the time of Episode VI, and given the age of his current body, he definitely had the same intention to take over the body of someone far younger and more powerful. It fails on Luke, and fails again on Rey - a symbolic symmetry that JJ was clearly aiming to achieve.

This change is important and one that I feel damages the original scene in Episode VI. **The intent of the original scene was to highlight Luke's character and commitment to the Jedi principles.** Despite the mastermind behind all of the terrible galactic events sitting unarmed in front of him, he resists the urge to act out of hate and slay the Emperor. This resistance is exactly the principle that Yoda teaches him the movie before, where Luke learns that ""Jedi use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.""

Palpatine knows this and tells Luke to kill him. In the pre-TRoS universe, he's not doing this because he's suicidal. He's doing this because he knows that anyone who sees the Emperor would be vulnerable to falling to their own hatred, and in that vulnerability rises weakness. Palpatine knows that hatred is the ultimate counter to the Jedi principles Yoda must have taught him, so he exploits Luke's natural hatred towards him by taunting and goading him.

The risk in this scene, therefore, is symbolic. If Luke kills the Emperor, he is no better than the Sith. Killing Sidious right there would end the war, but the method clashes with the ideals of both the Rebel alliance and the fallen Jedi Order they revere. Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor - embodied by the quote ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me"" - is **monumental because most people, including us in the audience, would have abandoned their morals and principles to get that cheap kill.** And that's why Luke is a Jedi, while most people aren't.

Come TRoS, and now we know that the risk Luke is facing is no longer symbolic and of character, but rather an existential risk. If Luke kills the Emperor, he would literally die and have his corpse taken over by the Emperor. Existential risks can make for good storytelling too, but in this case it seriously degrades the significance of the original scene. Now Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor is one motivated by pure survival instincts - not by a delicate adherence to Jedi principles. Tell Han Solo that blasting the Emperor would mean he dies and OF COURSE Han would put his blaster away. Luke's decision is no longer a show of unique character, but rather a decision that even you and I, as non-Jedi, would've made in that situation.

This is why the Emperor laughs when Luke finally does strike and is blocked by Vader. It means his goal of instilling hatred in Luke is succeeding. Given TRoS, Palpatine should've yelled ""Vader you ruined my plan of spirit transfer!"" instead of laughing.

The only solution I see to this thematic retcon is that Luke, while making his decision in Episode VI, isn't aware of the Emperor's spirit transfer and is thus still making his choice based on character rather than survival instinct. While this reduces the damage to the uniqueness of his character, it still damages the scene because strips it of some of the stakes. We as the audience now understand that there is no reward for killing the Emperor. Until Vader betrayed him, the Emperor would have won if Luke attacked and still would have won if Luke spared him. It's a lose-lose situation either way.

Luke's decision in the pre-retcon version of the scene was significant because he was presented with a win-lose situation, where killing the Emperor would have meant a quick victory for the rebels, and yet still chose the losing outcome that came at a cost to his own safety at the hands of the Emperor's lightning.",Thematic Retcon in The Rise of Skywalker that reduces the symbolic significance of the Original Trilogy
StarWars,"I've seen people arguing over the prequels, the Sequels, Rebels, Resistance, and Battlefront. But what none of you realize is that none of you are true Star Wars fans. 

True Star Wars fans hate the Prequels for bad dialogue and CGI, the Originals for Ewoks, the Sequels because Disney bought them and ruined your childhood. True Star Wars fans don't watch kiddie crap like Clone Wars, Rebels, or Resistance. They don't play non-EU games like Battlefront or Fallen Order. They don't read the Disney SJW comics like Dr. Aphra - or the ripoff books like Zahn's new Thrawn trilogy. 

You know what real Star Wars fans like?

Parasite. Cause that's what you all are. (And it's a seriously great movie. Watch it. The subtitles aren't that big of a deal.)

*Obviously all this is sarcastic. As Eric at Blind Wave so eloquently put it: ""you're a Star Wars fan if you like Star Wars."" You can not like other parts of the Saga, you can favor others. But true Star Wars fans understand the Saga is about bringing people together, not pushing them apart. So don't hate on people for what they like. Or Chewie will rip your arms off. See how you type then!*",True Star Wars fans Hate the OT
StarWars,"*While I feel that I am absolutely not alone in this, it is my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.*

Ahsoka is arguably (if not absolutely) the greatest embodiment of a strong female character in the entirety of the Star Wars franchise. This primarily stems from the fact that we've seen her journey from a naive, headstrong Padawan that frequently got herself into trouble with her youth and inexperience to the nearly-unanimously loved character that still isn't perfect, but is strong - both in her combat skills and her cunning intellect - in spite of her imperfections. Indeed, it's the fact that she's imperfect and still makes mistakes that makes her so relatable and widely loved.

As a ""man's man,"" of sorts, and an avid fan of the franchise (maintained thanks to this season of Clone Wars and the Mandalorian series), I can say, proudly and without a sliver of doubt, that Ahsoka is one of my favorite characters in the entire franchise. 

Characters like Ahsoka, Bo-Katan, and Cara Dune are strong, badass female characters because we've either seen their journey to that point, or they simply are without trying to be. If Dave Filoni has the reigns for any future Star Wars movies, I see no shortage of naturally compelling, strong, and widely loved female characters. 

*To Dave Filoni and his colleagues: **Thank you for all your hard work on the incredible stories and beloved characters that have expanded the Star Wars universe more than we ever imagined. The force will undoubtedly be with you. Always.**","Star Wars needs more Ahsoka Tanos, Bo-Katans, and Cara Dunes."

StarWars,"I would love to see a movie about the Empire, like one from the point of view from. Stormtrooper during the age of the rebellion. There are two sides to every story, and we only get to see one in the movies. There are some comics out there that kind of cover this, but not in a big scope like a movie could. I would love to see a stand alone, but maybe even a trilogy about it. 

Movie #1: Rise of the Empire
We are on a very poor planet, maybe Corellia? We meet a young man, 19 or 20 and he lives in a poor family. His father is a ship builder, working on imperial ships. From a you g age he has always been impressed with these ships. His family struggles to survive because of the gangs that ravage the area of the plant he lives on. The gang attacks the Imperial ship yard one day and kills his father, so the empire strike back at them and destroys this gang. He looks up to the Empire after this and enlists in the Imperial Army and we follow him though this journey in the first film.

Movie #2: Glory Days
This is set 10 years later. After proving himself a more than capable solider he is promoted to the Stormtrooper corps. We see him fight along side his fellow troopers in small battles putting down insurrection across the galaxy, small band of rebels are starting to pop up. We can see the good in the Empire here, how they had good intentions, just not always see through in the best way. He starts a family of his own, only to see it destroyed when a rebel cell attacks the Imperial base he is stationed on.

Movie #3: Empires End
This movie starts only 2 years before ROTJ. Our main character is not a commanding officer in the Imperial Navy. We see conflict in him as he has seen the extreme tactics used by the empire ( The usage of the first Death Star) but he still believes in the core value of the Empire and he believes that it is the best form of stability for the Galaxy. He is now a grizzled veteran and has seen a lot. Being the experienced soilder he is the High command decides to place his unit in charge of the defense of the defense of the Second Death Star. He personally oversees the troopers positioned on the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. His position is overrun by Han and the rebel forces, but he survives the battle, only to be executed in the end for the “evil acts” he committed against the galaxy, when is reality, he was only doing what he felt was right in the galaxy

To see this tragic hero’s journey from the other side of things I think would be very interesting. There were people in the galaxy that thought the Empire was good, and up until the final years of its rein, it was for all intensive proposes was good. On top of that maybe we would be able to see a storm trooper hit its target for once!",Empie Movie
StarWars,"The other day I saw a 34 minute long video on youtube which summarised the Skywalker saga with footage and audio from all the movies. It started with the Phantom Menace and finished up with RSW. It was very emotional, an amazing build up. But when we reached The Force Awakens, I noticed that the build up was broken. There was no build up anymore, The Force Awakens seemed to be a completely unrelated episode since it just started with Rey sitting in the sand doing basically nothing. 

I understood that the sequel trilogy is not really part of the Skywalker saga. It just takes some elements and characters from that saga and makes up a completely new story and saga. The Skywalker saga finishes with The Return of the Jedi, Anakin fulfils the prophecy and Luke becomes the hero he will always be. The sequel trilogy is just a different story. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that perspective in mind, I learned to appreciate the sequel trilogy, because it does not bother me how they destroy some characters like Luke, or how they introduce inconsistencies on the universe, like using light speed to destroy other ships. Or why Rey is so skilful and powerful without training, while Luke needed more training. To me these are not inconsistencies since the sequel trilogy simply is not a sequel to the other movies. I can sit back and enjoy the sequel trilogy now and see them as entertaining movies with great visual effects and some nice characters (I actually like Rey's personality). That being said, these are fun movies, mostly made for kids and not necessarily something I would be very enthusiastic about. I like them, but I don't love them like I love the REAL Skywalker saga.",Learning to appreciate the sequels
StarWars,"I am not saying we should not criticized any movie. Do it if you have to however there come to the point we have to keep all the negativity in check.

I said this for a reason because I just watch podcast by wise crack and the pod cast make me realized how Star Wars have a reputation for after the Last Jedi by how fan react make people and artist not to want to do star wars. Many real talent who created incredible story a film probably will avoid star wars at all cost.

George Lucas who many fan want to come back even said this ""Why would I make any more, when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?""

He also said this before TFA. The fact of the matter is there are still people on Twitter replied to Rian johnson account on every tweet he made even once that not related to star wars and say how he should dies.

StarWars,"And i was like wtf. I mean I’ve been shipping Ezra and Sabine since season one but apart from that: is there anything already known about Ezra‘a future? I heard a rumour that Ahsoka might be in The Mandalorian next season, might that also count for Sabine? Cause they travel together to find Ezra or did u understand that wrong?
I have finished the fourth season in 2 days and it was absolutely gorgeous, but now I don‘t know what to do next. I kinda want to see more of this but it’s over now.

StarWars,"Despite that he's kinda bland, Cal is my new favorite character in Star Wars (an honor Starkiller held for years), and I think it'd be interesting to see him in other, Star Wars related properties (comics, books, maybe even in one of the Disney+ shows). I'd really enjoy seeing him as one of the most well-known Force users in the Rebellion before Luke joins. It'd be interesting to see them together, especially during the time Luke tries to rebuild the Jedi Order after ROTJ, since Cal believes that the destiny of all the Force-senstives should be left to the Force itself.

And I'd really like to see him face off against Vader again, and maybe even Kylo Ren, as a grizzled, aged Jedi Knight.",Cal Kestis beyond Jedi: Fallen Order?

StarWars,"I and a good friend of mine were greatly displeased with the Star Wars Trilogy and its disappointing finale. So we decided to create our version of the Sequel Trilogy in the form of 3 scripts. One for each movie of course. The set up is as follows, After the death of Emperor Palpatine, Imperial figures fight over the rightful ""throne"" to the empire, creating an internal war inside the empire. Soon, the empire breaks off into hundreds of Imperial factions with different leaders. The Jedi suffer a similar fate, as luke skywalker and several other Jedi decide to abandon the ways of ""Jedi"" and ""Sith"" and create a community where people are allowed to interpret the force in their own ways. Soon conflict breaks out between the remaining pure Jedi, and the free-thinking Jedi. Kylo Ren, a leader of an Imperial Faction, creates a political movement calling for the reforming of the imperial government, more specifically calling for the factions to come together to form the empire that once was. His belief is that since economic resources are spread so thin across the factions, there will be no way to defeat the Jedi. Unless they all come together. Kylos movement gains a following, and soon the empire comes together at last with a stronger desire to take down the Jedi than ever before under their new Extremist Leader, Kylo Ren. Now, Luke Skywalker and his group of free-thinking Jedi have to come to terms with the pure Jedi to stop the empire once again.",Fan-made Star Wars Trilogy

seriously, its insane how nowadays, the prequels are held up as brilliant films while the sequels are negated to trash just because disney made them. look, i dont think the sequels are great, but i still enjoy them. they arguably have better writing and dialogue then the prequels, and better relationships between characters (poe and finn's opening is really strong) . they also have better effects, and arent all just CGI.

while the prequels have cool worldbuilding and great lightsaber duels, but suffer with the dialogue and character relationships.

both of them can be enjoyed, and both have aspects that are really cool. the main problem with the sequels was the lack of planning and clear vision, while the prequels suffered from one man not being told no to some of his ideas.

Anyways, this episode is one of the best pieces of SW content EVER made imo. And it’s only the first half hour of what’s going to be an incredible next 3 episodes. The way the dialogue is delivered in every scene is heart wrenching if you’ve seen all these characters develop through 7 seasons as we have and knowing what is to come in RotS. The way they linger on Anakin as Ahsoka tells him “good luck” is just ridiculously good writing knowing this is the last time they will see each other before Malachor. When anakin says “this will all be over soon” he’s right to a certain extent, but in no way shape or form is it going to end how any of them think it will obviously.

Also, can we talk about the attack on Mandalore??? One of the best action sequences ever. Seriously. Watching Ahsoka throw in mixes of Trakata turning her blades on and off throughout the battle along with how the music just completely cuts out in the moment before she lands on the platform and then BOOM crescendos into the finale as she lands and stands up with the explosion behind her.

StarWars,"I can't remember a time when I have not loved Star Wars. My earliest days of loading on Episode Two at the start of the arena and watch to the end. Playing Battlefront 2 so many times that I went elite in most of the classes. So upset with my dad for not letting me see Episode Three in theaters because I wasn't thirteen yet. When the 2d animated show ran for three minutes on Friday I could never wait for next week's taste. When I finally was able to appreciate the whole series from start to finish, even if the prequels were not as good as I remebered. When the 3d show was announced and my excitement started all over again. I remember when Disney bought Lucasfilm and the worse part was the Clome Wars was cancelled. But I defended it, anyone who did not believe in the new future was just stuck in the past. 



They had Marvel under their belt, a catalog of heroes and villians that was slowly all building together to what would be an unforgettable end. I thought this is what was in store for my beloved Star Wars. And TFA I saw in the theater and I was let down. The death of the EU was disappointing. But this was just a hiccup, a mistep, they would recover and the next two would be the story of the OT with the spectacle of PT. But TLJ was nothing but confusing and conflicting. Careful lore and a built up world was tossed aside. I won't go into the details but the things wrong were far too many. I did not even watch RoS after what I heard.



I had nearly given up on my once beloved series when the Clone Wars last season would drop. I would give it a shot. It could do no worse then what has already happened. Well the first part was no great blunder as TLJ but missed a sense of urgency a build up to RoTS. And then I watched Old Friends Not Forgotten and in my heart was the most painful experience of happiness and sadness in my heart. Name drops and call backs to moments from other parts. I felt rewarded for my love, for my knowledge. I was part of an exclusive club because I was with those who loved Star Wars like me. And as the episode ended amd the credits rolled I came crashing to earth at the destruction and lack of creativity or care take with this amazing franchise. That I was no longer Disney's target audience for Star Wars and that I no longer belonged here... It hurt me...

So, sadly, I think I will enjoy the last episode of Clone Wars as it is the last time part of this cash cow that was meant for me.

I also thought there was a lot more meta fiction in the film— more subtext, symbolism, more overall artistry that isn’t necessarily a staple of the previous star wars films. I enjoyed this change of pace and thought it freshened up a film I had avoided watching for months (out of the fear that it would ruin my childhood).

StarWars,"Bit of a long post here, and I may be completely wrong on this theory, but I welcome discussion and constructive criticism.

We all know Anakin becomes Vader after assisting Sidious in killing Mace Windu. One sign of this is the typical Sith eye color when Vader storms the Jedi Temple and commits Jedi genocide.

However, when on Mustafar, this changes. From the moment Padme and Obi-Wan arrive to the moment he falls from Obi-Wan's final blow, Anakin's eyes are his normal color. 

My theory is this: Anakin did not commit fully to the Dark Side until the END of the duel with Obi-Wan.

For the entirety of the duel, Anakin's eyes are his own. He is allowing a duel to last far longer than it should for a Sith should with such raw power. He even says to Oni-Wan on his last offensive strike: ""This is the end for you, my master.""

If Anakin has accepted Sidious as a new master, why would he address Obi-Wan with the same title? I believe it's because Anakin is confused, scared, and feeling regret. I feel as if that line to Obi-Wan is a projection of his feelings to Sidious, the master who robbed him of his humanity. 

Anakin's eyes shift again when Obi-Wan de-limbs him. You see the fear and pain in his Sith eyes. He didn't want Obi-Wan dead; he wanted Obi-Wan to save him, and he struck him down to die. To me, THAT is the real moment Vader was born.

TL;DR - Anakin didn't commit to the Dark Side until Obi-Wan took a hand instead of giving him a hand.","ROTS: Anakin fell, but was it at the moment we all thought?"

Basically I just escaped Tardis, I’m about 10 hours into the game and so far I kind of hate the Jedi?

StarWars,"Hello everyone,

I was rewatching the last Jedi last night and I noticed something in the flash back scene of the temple burning. Luke said that Ben had vanished with a handful of his students and slaughtered the rest. We see a shot of the temple burning and like 5 or 6 bodies in front of R2 and luke. My question is how is this possible? In the kylo ren comic it’s shown that the temple exploded from the storm clouds above and Ben said he never wanted any of this. So how is it possible there were all those dead students in front of Luke if Ben did not kill them. I checked the scene again and the bodies were not burnt so they obviously did not die from the fire or the explosion. They were obviously killed by a person. Did Ben actually kill all those students and we just didn’t see it? Can you guys help me figure out this lore discrepancy? I’m having a hard time envisioning what actually happened on that night at the temple and to those students. Is it a retcon or is there an in-universe lore explanation? Thanks for the help everyone. I really look forward to reading all your replies! :)",Did Ben Solo kill the other students at Luke’s Jedi temple or was it palpatine/snoke’s storm cloud?
StarWars,Because it's simply a safe option to go with in marketing a character. Which is why I will always like seeing characters like Ahsoka on screen because it really disproves the idea that you need to have a human character as a main protagonist to relate to audiences. Right now for the most part alien protagonists in Star Wars don't get a lot of screen time and are usually reduced to being a sidekick and comedic relief or a background character. So whenever we get a character like Ahsoka or somebody like Hera on screen I will always appreciate seeing it.,Honestly for a story that takes place in a galaxy with over a over 3.2 million habitable systems.. Star Wars currently has a problem in overusing human characters as their main protagonist.
StarWars,"So I've heard that the only thing George Lucas considered canon was the first six movies and the clone wars show. And that Legends was not canon because it didn't fall into his view of what canon is. 

So are the new movies part of his canon? I know they are considered canon by lucasfilm and disney since they are owned by them and licensed by them. 

But does George consider them part of his canon or is this like legends where its not part of his universe but still a licensed canon thing.

StarWars," Phantom Meance = undead Emperor

Attack of the Clones = First order, final order and Palpatine being in a clone body

Revenge of the Sith = Palpatine's goal

StarWars,"I, like many of you, tend to link Ahsoka &amp; Maul in my imagination, &amp;amp; so when Katan said, “We have a common enemy,” I was like, “Yeah, totally.”

But the more I think about it, it does seem odd to me that Ahsoka feels so responsible to take out Maul. She’s not a Jedi, her former love wasn’t murdered, she hadn’t fought him before Rebels really, so what am I missing?

Is there something personal b/w them I’m overlooking? Is Ahsoka really invested in Mandalore after those months teaching in their academy? I’m all here for the story (loving it!) but I’m drawing a bit of a blank.

StarWars,"At some point during this arc, there is going to be a time where it will be quite obvious that the Grand Army of the Republic is no more and things are going to change forever.

We’ll probably see that a ton when Rex and Ashoka are realizing and escaping order 66. That’s gonna be tough to watch cause all our favorite republic characters are either dying or turning.

I hope that in the chaos of order 66 and the events of episode three that we see in the show. That at some point we hear or see some separatists reacting to the events of episode three and are still stuck in the illusion palpatine created.

They are an incredibly cool faction and everyone down at Lucasfilm did a tremendous job developing them as antagonists. I’d love some sort of bitter sweet moment where a general or politician is trying to motivate people to keep fighting and still really believe in the Separatists while the the galaxy is violently changing round them.


I’d just love as much separatist content before the end as we can.


Also’d love to see some as many Dukoo and Grevious scenes as possible before the end.",I hope we get a good sendoff to the separatists (Clone Wars S7)

I also Last Jedi. The problem is the Hardcore fans that give me a hard time just liking the guy and liking TLJ.

StarWars,"just wanna ease the pain of order 66 hopefully sorta kinda even tho the finale will make me cry anyway,
idk why everyone is saying the clones will betray everyone in like 2 days, keep in mind that as anakin and ahsoka part ways, anakin is off to save the palpatine and right when he gets back padmé reveals shes pregnant. by the time order 66 is taking place, padme is giving birth to the twins just soon after so Ahsoka has been on mandalore for atleast 8-9 months plus anakin doing his stuff with the chancellor on coruscant while obiwan is on utapau fighting grievous. its like people thinking the Majin Buu saga in Dragonball Z takes place during the span of months when in irl time its only like a 2-3 days at most.

TLDR - After Anakin and Ahsoka part ways we still have 9 months until order 66 not just a few days

edit- it sounds like I'm wrong and were weeks away anyway brace urself for sadness ;-;",TCW S7 timeframe before order 66
StarWars,"*Rebels SPOILERS below*


I’m watching Rebels for the first time and I just finished S3 EP21 and 22 (Zero Hour) and these two episodes really had Empire at War vibes. Star destroyers meeting the Rebel fleet. One of the rebel ships then getting stopped by an Interdictor while trying to go into hyper space. Thrawn’s star destroyer then joining the action out of no where. It gave me goosebumps. Then the land battle after the Rebels retreated only to finally escape after taking down the Interdictor. It all was so awesome. I hope to see another Star Wars game with fleet action similar to that of Empire at War or Rogue squadron! What do you guys think?",Has anyone ever played Empire at War?
StarWars,"When the Expanded Universe really started putting out books and comics at the start of the 90's, Heir and Dark Empire were sort of a relaunch with the intention of more interconnected stories, George Lucas and Lucasfilm put a hold on any prequel era stories lest they eventually be contradicted by future movies. Except for tales of the jedi which has Lucas' involvement and was way way before the prequel movies 

However the ""Clone Wars"" was still a major galaxy changing event that was going to come up if anyone talked about the Jedi. So Zhan and others based their small hints of the Clone Wars off of talks with Lucas and Lucasfilm, previous interviews given by Lucas, and the movie its self.

However by 1999 when the Phantom Menace came out Lucas' ideas of what the clone wars and prequel trilogy era looked like greatly differed from the ideas in the nineties ( Which is a bit sad to me as I like some of the ideas better such as the clone wars being longer ago and the purge happening over a greater amount of time. it just makes more sense for people forgetting the jedi.) So some of the thing said about the jedi while vague ended up being a bit contradictory and having to be retconned to fit.

And thinking about it Snoke and Kylo's back story is the same basic thing except over a shorter amount of time.

Now after TROS we know Snoke as a failed clone of Palpatine's. However in the TFA visual dictionary it says multiple things about Snoke that we now know is not true such as him being older than the Empire, being from the unknown regions, having no connection to the sith. In the TLJ novelization we even get Snoke's inner thoughts about his history and meeting the first order. The TLJ visual dictionary plays that angle up even more.

Same for Kylo Ren. In the visual dictionary for TFA it talks about his torture chair being used to hunt down jedi survivors. But based on what we see in Rise of Kylo Ren he knows their are no more survivors. It mentions him as the Jedi Killer and hunting down Jedi but again according to the comic its not exactly how it went down.

Their are also some other minor things about how the FO functions that changes as well with it going from the FO being the one to have people sitting on the boards of directors syphoning off materials to make ships to it being the Sith Eternal

However because this was only over 6 years and not 10 and because they didn't allow any books to really be released during this time period except for the movie tie ins which were all kept pretty vague concerning the things going on. We only really have these issues with the VD and not as much with the books and comics.

Anyways I just made the connection the other day and thought it was a interesting one and shows how no matter how much we love the books and comics and games they are always in danger of having something like a movie or show come along and change the narrative.",The history of Snoke and Kylo is similar to the history of the Clone Wars in Legends but on a shorter time scale.
StarWars,"I was rewatching the Clone Wars when I noticed something strange that Maul said. When he has his weird robot spider legs on Lotha Minor he says “the chains are the easy part it’s what they do up here” and points to his head. Now this would seem normal enough, considering he’s insane at this point, but when you take the fact that The Son said that verbatim to Ahsoka on Mortis it makes it a bit strange. We know from Rebels that the Son, Daughter, and Father were known to a few via art and history. Is it possible that Maul has some sort of connection to The Son, beyond both being dark side force wielders. They also both temporarily converted a main character to the dark side, and are both voiced by the same person. Thoughts?",Darth Maul and The Son connection?

StarWars,"Honestly I had heard almost everything about the final Disney Star Wars movie that I had no need to go to the movies to watch it.

I am having a very hard time understanding this.  I mean let’s get down to brass tacts and let’s be real here.  Disney owns Star Wars and Disney owns Marvel and they have the final say in any content that is done under their banner.

So why was Disney so very careful to make sure spoilers were controlled for Infinity War and End Game and that same level of dedication was NOT seen for the final Star Wars movie?  It make zero sense to me.

Anyone care to guess?",So I need your help understanding this: Why was there so many spoilers about the last movie out there?
StarWars,"So... I'm not saying it should happen. I have no idea what would be done with the character. But in the Star Wars EU,  which long before the disney merger had Darth Maul survive and wookiepedia page for every background alien in the Mos Eisley cantina, it seems like we would have gotten someone's attempt at a Mace Windu survival story. And I know I'm not the first person to think of it, so why has it never happened? Has George Lucas said something? Samuel L Jackson? We've seen a lot of extra Windu pre ROTS, but never a single book, comic, or run on sentence of a Windu survival story. Which, once again, is probably totally unnecessary, but it seems like an odd pocket of restraint for the Star Wars EU, which gobbles up movie tie-ins like candy, no matter how obscure. 

I mean, is it odd to anyone else?",Why hasn't Mace Windu ever been brought back?

Anakin is one of the greatest characters ever written to me, but the way he is portrayed in the clone wars makes it seem like he’s a good person and he cares about people. The way he talks to Ahsoka in the last episode, the way him and obi-wan interact make them seem like brothers, the way Rex is his best friend, and the way he hates the separatists. All of this just makes it seem like he cares too much to turn to the dark side like he did.

My parents always let me watch the OT and the series, but said I was too young for the prequels, so when they finally let me watch them, it was kind of a disappointment, although at least I added on the character development of the series to make it bearable.

Now the show is about to end, and in particular this last episode gave me a lot of tiny moments that made me really appreciate this amazing cartoon for what its impact on me liking Star Wars has been.",I got emotional
StarWars,"Today I watched the latest episode of The Clone Wars on Disney + and during it  &gt;!Anakin and Obi-Wan answer the call to rescue Palpatine above Coruscant.!&lt;. I found this to be an incredibly fitting time to watch Revenge of the Sith -- for the first time in about ten years!

I loved it, but I found it to be very streamlined. 

It's understandable. After 7 seasons of an incredible TV series, you're compressing Anakin's Betrayal into two and half hours, half of which is spent sweeping up Dooku and Grievous. 

So after watching it, I thought I would revisit the novel. I read the novel in my teenage years and I LOVED IT. I barely remember it nowadays but I know it's legends. Does it hold well in canon?

Yes, I know there are contradictions. But I am one that is willing to retcon them in my head to have a less ""rushed"" Episode 3, if you will.

So my question? What are you impressions on the episode 3 novelisation in 2020? With your knowledge now of Disney's expanded universe?",Anyone reading the Revenge of the Sith novelisation in 2020?
StarWars,"Was it flawed? Oh hell yeah, nothing is perfect. But does it deserve hate or scorn, no. Could the writing have been better, yeah. Could it have been condensed, maybe. Would it being condensed have taken away from Ahsoka's character growth, who knows.

It gives us a glimpse at two people directly affected by the Jedi and the lack of care for the average person the Jedi developed. And Rafa and Trace were believably written as siblings, they are both a bit naive of the greater galaxy, the younger more so than the older. After all the Jedi caused the death of their parents. And then...Ahsoka enters their lives, an ex-jedi who has no real knowledge of how the Jedi are viewed by the general populace.

Ahsoka learns that most of the galaxy doesn't exactly care for the Jedi, that the Jedi are not viewed as peace keepers, and the Jedi don't exactly look out for the little guy and don't help those who might need help. This causes her to reexamine her view of the Jedi, the view she was taught from the moment she was brought into the order as a child.

The arc was necessary for her character growth. Now some of you might point at the book about her. But it doesn't go properly into her change of view on the Jedi.",I have what might be an unpopular opinion. The Walk About Arc was good.
StarWars,"I want to preface this to give you a bit of history about me.

I Have never watched a single star wars movie from start to finish. But i do know all about star wars. I know about the eu, mara jade, dark horse comic story lines, i have even played SWTOR and was even in a guild on that game despite it being more than a decade old, I am also a huge star wars fan. I recently just had an epiphany and realized that even though i know so much about this franchise and i watch content about it all the time. I have never seen the movies from start to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

Except for ep 4 and the sequel trilogy but i have watched them each once and re watched bits and pieces of the force awaken before turning them off just because of how bad it was, even though its the best of the sequels. IMO

I dont want to reveal my age but i ""grew up"" with the prequels even though i have never seen them in their entirety. All i can say is that i had star wars ep 3 rots for my ps2 and i also had battle front 2 for ps2 aswell growing up. Those games made me fall in love with the franchise but i was very poor and never was able to see the films. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also adore movies and i have even written scripts but just for fun. I love watching critiques of movies and tv shows and i love chanells like nostalgia critic, avgn and especially red letter media. I dont really agree with their views on the prequels i see where they are coming from but i dont think they are as bad, and yes the prequels are my favorite trilogy.

And yes Star wars is the greatest franchise ever.

&amp;#x200B;

So you made it this far, what do i hope to accomplish with this post? Im gonna actually watch the prequels in their  entirety. I will also review them and i will give my most unbiased opinion possible.

I know this is a very strange post, and i fear that the mods will remove my posts but its worth a shot right. 

Plus come on how many people are hige star wars fans love this franchise with everything they have but have never seen the movies??? Im kind of an anomaly. I think.

So if you are interested i will be posting my reviews on the movie. I think you would like it cause like i said im an outlier and i think i can provide a possible NEW never b4 heard of opinion on these movies. IDK.

Edit: my theory is that because all the threat is gone and only rey exist as a jedi , then every jedi or padawan would come out of hiding but they discover it that rey is palpatine and would never accept her.
Some try to hurt her for revenge. (Here we will explore the unknown planets of star war galaxy)
In middle of all these, rey got her own padawan and try to persuade her to join her in training and so she succeed.
But what she don't know that her padawan's mother was a sith cultist who died during battle of exegol and father was ex military for first order who survived &amp; unemployed and had very tough life raising his child (here we can go with conflict between padawan and master) .

And this will be new story of rey.

StarWars,"There are a large number of fans are upset that Kylo died at all, and wish that he had more of redemption arc.  It seems like the redemption arc that he got was already trying to pander to those fans. So who should have been the big bad. Not many people like the Emperor coming back, and it could not have been Kylo since Kathleen Kennedy is seeming doing backflips to keep those fans who love Kylo happy. So who does that leave.  I would suggest maybe Hux , but he was made into a weak fool in TLJ who is only around to be a messed over.

StarWars,"If today's episode of TCW taught me anything, it's that I like this series the most during its darker moments. I love feeling with my characters, experiencing their loss, learning more about them and their worlds. I would love to see something from, say, a Sith perspective rooted in... Darker tones, more focused on the 'Wars' part of 'Star Wars.' I think there would be a pretty solid fanbase for something like this--would love people's takes!

StarWars,"Ok the last few episodes may have been a little slow, but now we have prime Clone Wars again. I love the playful banter between Obi Wan and Anakin, but at times you could see Anakin’s animosity/frustration growing towards Obi Wan. 

And you could also see Anakin’s emotional side in his exchanges with Ahsoka. He looked so sad when Ahsoka wouldn’t catch up with him when they first reunited. He would do anything for her, even though she doesn’t need it anymore. The action scenes were great. This was an awesome episode and I can’t wait to see what happens next!",[CW S7 SPOILERS] S7:E9 was awesome!
StarWars,"ahsoka's walkabout is critical for her development and maturity as a character in the seventh season.  during this arc, she mainly learns about how normal people view the jedi, something that she hasnt had to encounter before. as we see in the first episode, she still believes that the jedi are good, she still believes that they protect the galaxy, during the conversation with trace, she defends the jedi as peacekeepers in a war that they didnt initiate.

&amp;#x200B;

in a narrative and story sense, this sets up her truth. that the jedi, at their core, are peacekeepers and protect the galaxy. however, throughout the arc, she learns about the  relative poverty of  the lower levels of coruscant, how people have to resort to crime to survive.   how normal people rarely go to the surface, or see the jedi, or even know what they do. thorugout the arc, she realizes that this perception is incorrect. and she learns something more.

Rafa's story about her parents also relates to her own experience. how the jedi are blinded by dogma, to arrogant to admit their own mistakes, whether that be the death of an innocent parent or wronglully accusing a member of their order with treason.

&amp;#x200B;

the jedi consistently use the force as their excuse, that it is the will of the force that these events happen.  both with luminara and mace windu use a similar excuse when faced with the consequences of their actions.

through trace and rafa, ahsoka sees that the jedi are blinded by hubris, and dont actually serve the people they are supposed to be protecting. they have been led astray by politics and the war.

&amp;#x200B;

on a different point, trace and rafa put ahsoka in an awkward position. she has to be and is in a position of experience amongst people who have no experience with the wider galaxy. she needs to lead them and guide them, this makes her a better leader.

trace and rafa also represent two sides of ahsoka, the naive, and the relatively street wise and cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

trace is season 1 ahsoka, over trusting, rash, impatient, kinda clueless rafa is more mature, but still foolish, so season 3 ahsoka. they mirror different stages of ahsokas development.

this leads into episode 9 (spoilers)  where ahsoka is angry at obi wan for not helping the regular people of mandalore in favor of going to save one important political figure. her experiences with trace and rafa  lead her to recognize that she can be an example of what the jedi should be. and she would not be in this position of wisdom in episode 9 if not for meeting trace and rafa.

i know it probably could have been shorter, but thats just my two cents.

StarWars,"I just finished the recent episode and it was amazing. With that being said, something crossed my mind when it finished. This was the last time that Anakin and Ahsoka would see each other before Anakin turns to the dark side. It was a touching moment, and I did enjoy it. But, there’s a part of me that didn’t. Let me explain. When we see them meet in Rebels, Ahsoka says “I won’t leave you, not this time”. This line hits hard because the last time they saw one another she was walking away from the Jedi temple leaving him there alone. This was a huge moment and I feel like their interaction in this new episode takes away from that. They part on good terms here with him giving back her lightsabers and wishing one another good luck. It was a great moment, but in the grand scheme of things a part of me wishes they never met face to face. Now you can argue and say that her line in Rebels was calling back to her choice to go to Mandalore while he went to save the Chancellor on Coruscant. But even still, it wouldn’t have the same impact as when she left the Jedi.",Clone Wars

And there being a reimagined game for the Old Republic, I would like to speculate that Revan is going to be reintroduced back into canon with a new Old Republic EA game that will reimagine his character and his story to make him fit into canon. But in the case of a Old Republic movie trilogy, I think they should do a film with Tarre Vizsla and him during the Mandalorian Wars, I think it would make one interesting film with him struggling to choose sides with the Jedi Order or the Mandalorians. Maybe see his perspective on the Mandalorian wars and him trying to choose a side between the Jedi Order or his people. Maybe we could see him creating the Darksaber, and I think with the right writer and director, it could work.

I don’t know about you guys but I turned into a little kid again when I watched this episode. This season at start was very slow and very not interesting with the first few Ahsoka episode’s with trace and Rafa and then the Bad bad batch arc was not bad but could’ve been worse but then Oh My God! So firstly Anakin being Anakin as he is being unpredictable with his plans with Obi Wan watching him in the background like a concerned father figure, surprising the separatists with a surprise attack. Then soon after Ahsoka comes back with information about Maul being on Mandalore, that’s when Star Wars Episode III starts with the chancellor being kidnapped by Greivous and Count Dooku making Obi Wan and Anakin being unable to join Ahsoka in the assault but not with out Anakin wishing her luck and gives her her old lightsabers that also have a blue color making me want to kill Anakin for changing the colors 😡😡😡. So with a combined attack with the 501st and the Mandolorian’s they go around to try and take control of the city while also find Maul and capture him. Then Ahsoka meets Maul as he comes out seeing it’s not Obi Wan but Ahsoka. With the amazing and talented Sam Witwer playing Darth Maul just made me jump out me seat making me a giddy little kid.

StarWars,"Think about it. Anakin's lightsaber was destroyed in TLJ. Without a lightsaber, Rey cannot fight Kylo or even hope to confront Palpatine. With time fast running out, she searches through Luke's old books and discovers the location of a hidden cave filled with kyber crystals, miraculously undiscovered and untouched by the old Empire. From there, she undertakes the monumental task of building a lightsaber without the guidance of a master and only old texts for consultation. We see her use her ingenuity and craftiness as a scavenger to fashion a hilt from spare parts and scrap metal, which she imbues with the power of a never-before-seen-in-movie-form *yellow* kyber crystal. She then salvages as many kyber crystals as she can find, as these will be the foundation for training the next generation of Jedi, before leaving the cave and returning to the Resistance.

Right off the bat, this would have been much more compelling than searching for some dumb Sith dagger. In essence, the Sith dagger was nothing more than the search for a map that led to another map that led to a planet. Literally just a MacGuffin for the sake of padding the movie's runtime. However, reframing the journey as a search for a new kyber crystal makes the first act of TROS *so* much more meaningful to the story, because now Rey actually has a personal stake in this search. Without a lightsaber, she simply won't be able to hold her own against Kylo and the First Order. She *cannot* fail here.

Furthermore, calling back to The Old Republic, a Jedi constructing their first lightsaber is a very important milestone and a truly special spiritual experience. This could have been Rey decisively taking her first step into becoming a knight of the Jedi Order. Not only would this have been the first cinematic debut for a yellow lightsaber, but this would have been Star Wars' first cinematic depiction of the construction of a lightsaber. Imagine seeing Rey get frustrated with the complexity of such an alien task, and then finally sitting down and clearing her mind through the Force, allowing the lightsaber to come together on its own. Wouldn't that have been fucking epic? The aesthetic here would play perfectly into Rey's character as well. She isn't simply a Jedi of old; she intends to forge her own path and rebuild the Jedi Order anew. What better way to showcase her idiosyncrasy than by giving her a unique lightsaber color? For that extra cherry on top, give her lightsaber a unique sound the same way they did with Kylo's.

I could go on. Giving Rey a new lightsaber would establish her character growth from the previous 2 movies, and oh would you look at that, it would have been a nice parallel to Episode 6 when Luke also had a new lightsaber! It would have also been a proverbial passing of the torch between the OT/PT and the ST &amp; beyond. As Anakin's lightsaber defined the old era of Star Wars, Rey's new lightsaber will be the symbol of Star Wars' future.

If TROS chose to run with the yellow lightsaber from the beginning, I would have had a lot of respect for them sticking with an original idea for once instead of trying to ride the corpse of motifs and ideas from 40 years ago. I mean, this movie pretty much just repaired Anakin's lightsaber offscreen because it was so afraid of doing something innovative. I can't be the only one here who feels like is cowardly at best. They played it so safe that they ended up with an inferior product. All I can say is that it looks like bad business sense to me, and TROS' glut of pointless, empty goose chases that could have been much more meaningful is a microcosm of what I perceive to be Disney/LucasFilm's lack of vision with this franchise. Ultimately, I am just proposing a what-if scenario here, but my hope is that Disney learns the correct lessons moving forward to ensure that Episode 10 and beyond are the best that they can be.","I love Rey's yellow lightsaber at the end of TROS, and I really wish it saw more action than a cameo at the end of a movie. So it got me thinking. What if instead of a Sith dagger goose chase, the first act of TROS was dedicated to Rey's search for a new kyber crystal to build her own lightsaber?"
StarWars,"I wasn’t ready.

Ok, so aside from basically crying like a child seeing all of the Jedi spread out as they were in Episode III, I was confused as to why Ahsoka seemed uncharacteristically cold towards both Anakin and Obi Wan.

In her “sentencing”, those were (if I remember right), the only two actually supporting her innocence? It’s even mentioned when she is expelled that it was not unanimous.

I get that she felt betrayed by the Jedi, but damn girl those were the only two who stuck with you. 😂

StarWars,"After the speeder crash in AOTC, Zam hides out in a bar. A hugely overlooked part of her character (in the movie that is) is that she is a changeling. Anyone with a reasonable degree of common sense and situational awareness, something a bounty hunter should definitely have, would morph and slip out while Anakin and Obi-Wan were occupied. Instead, she decides, for some reason, to attempt to shoot Obi-Wan in the back at point blank range. Jedi are fairly distinct looking in comparison to any normal security force, so she definitely knew she was being chased by them, so walking very close to one of them is the worst possible decision she could have made. She's a hack, and handily the worse bounty hunter/contracted assassin we have seen in Star Wars. At least Greedo had believed he had the upper hand til the bitter end.

EDIT: They also take her out a back door at the end of the chase, so she could have also slipped out that door far away from either of the two Jedi and completely avoided detection.

StarWars,"I'm not sure if people realize it but the upcoming Siege of Mandalore arc has set itself up to be the conclusion to almost every major story arc in the series. For a show that first began as an anthology series, this finale has consolidated almost every single major story arc into just one finale.

* **Maul/Mandalore**. Two storylines that have already been consolidated on their own, and themselves are products of consolidation (Maul's storyline being a product of Ventress's and the Nightsisters arc. Hell, even Ventress's arc itself is a consolidated one, dealing with the bounty hunter episodes that came before and more.).

* **Ahsoka in general**. Again, this is something that has had a lot of consolidation. Many of the political arcs have consolidated into Ahsoka's central storyline. Padme's political bits fed into the Mina Bonteri assassination, which led to Lux Bonteri, which again fed right into both Ahsoka and the Mandalore arcs.

* **The Clone Troopers.** Between the storylines of Domino Squad, Rex as his own character, this entire storyline has taken us from training, to their first mission on Rishi, to Umbara, and finally to the Inhibitor Chip arc. And with Order 66 right around the corner, this will have a role to play in it all too.

Almost every significant storyline in the series has fused together into this one finale. The only two really major ones that *don't* are the Mortis arc and Yoda's odyssey arc, both of which are very spiritual and make more sense as one-offs anyhow. Others like the slavers arc aren't fundamentally essential but feed into the other side of the story, the one we've already seen (AKA Revenge of the Sith).

In the last 6 seasons, the showrunners spent so much time consolidating everything so it could all be tied up here in this final arc. That's incredible. I don't know how it took me so long to realize that's what was going on.","The Clone Wars started as an anthology. Now that we're finally here at the final arc, I've realized most major arcs have consolidated into one single story."
StarWars,"I noticed it was one of the main themes in the Prequels and Clone Wars. The Jedi are assumed to be perfect heroes who keep the peace, but as we look into them more (especially in The Clone Wars) they're not as perfect as they are thought to be. They never allowed showing of emotions (which is mentally unhealthy) and they said ""the force works in mysterious ways"" when they realized Ahsoka was framed, even though that's their shit excuse to make up for their lacking perspectives. But why were the Jedi the way they were? Why were they so flawed and why did they never think about how flawed they actually were?",Why were the Jedi so flawed during the Prequel Era?
StarWars,"Tomorrow, the final four episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars begins.  I have seen a lot of people predict we will see Order 66.

And it looks like we are going to see part of the Battle of Mygeeto.  Personally though, I would actually like to see Kato Nemodia, and what happened there with Anakin saving Obi-Wan for the 9th time, and why it doesn't count.  

However, the one I am hoping to see, and it looks like we may get it, unless I am reading too much into a trailer and scenes of a space battle, is the opening of the Battle of Coruscant.  As a fan of the 2003 Genndy Tartakovsky Clone Wars series, I enjoyed seeing the Battle of Coruscant as the series ended tying it to the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  In Legends, it is pretty epic, with Separatist ships crashing out of hyperspace into Republic ships as carriers land on the planet, but with Disney getting rid of a lot of that for their new canon, I kind of think this is one they needed to do, or at least show us the beginning.  This is one of the largest and final battles of the war, fought on the surface, the sky and in space, commanded by Count Dooku and all while General Grievous is on a mission to capture Chancellor Palpatine.  Of all the ways to end the series, I kind of feel the Battle of Coruscant should be the finale, or at least we should see part  of it.","Doubt it will happen, but would love to see the Battle of Coruscant in the final four"

Pros for 123 - I think that for a first time viewer watching in this order has the benefit of having the surprise that is Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader and would also have the viewer feeling more attached to Anakin as a character. 
Pros for 456 - Watching the OT first has similar benefits, being the surprise of Vader being Luke’s father.

StarWars,"Shoehorning Palpatine in just didn't work with the story in the last movie and I felt like a better villian was staring right in our faces. 

A dark side Luke Skywalker clone that wore Vader's suit. 

Mark Hamill was criminally underused in the whole trilogy and he deserved better. Giving him the role to play a dark side version of Luke would've been a treat. I also feel like it would change the meaning of Luke's vision in Dagobah to a prophecy. They could've had this clone have a connection to real Luke that influenced him for a couple moments to consider killing Ben as well. I would have used the younger Luke we see in the brief scene with Leia finishing her training to protest him. 

They could have explained that the sith acolytes were under orders by a message from Palpatine to create this Luke.

StarWars,"In the cartoon series “Star wars the Clone Wars”, S1 Ep2 the separatists have a ship called the Malevolent. The ship had an ion cannon which would disable ships electrical systems, making engines, shields, life support, and weapons systems not work. In the Revenge of the Sith, the opening scene is a battle over Coruscant. If the separatists sent A fleet in and then sent multiple ships with ion cannons, the ships with ion cannons could take out groups of Republic ships because they can’t fire back. Making it so the separatist could destroy the whole blockade more efficiently. That would then make way for a ground attack if they wanted. They would then have been able to take coruscant. This in turn would give them most all major hyperspace lanes lead that lead to Coruscant. They then would have most the senate, the chancellor, and all the war prisoners. It would be way a more efficient strategy, than what they did in the movie. They would be able to launch attacks anywhere in the Republic systems with ease.

StarWars,"My two biggest requests are

* An animated series about Luke's Jedi Academy, with Mark Hamill voicing
* A comic or novel about Leia training as a Jedi

The latter could work as a story in the former, but only if Hamill didn't voice. Given that Mark's voice sounds nothing like it did 37 years ago, I would want it to be an older, wiser Luke, and obviously that story happened quickly after RotJ. Plus it'd be weird to have Mark Hamill opposite someone other than Carrie Fisher as Leia.

For the animated series, it would be cool to get cameos from Matt Lanter, Tom Kane, and Stephen Stanton as Anakin, Yoda, and Ben, respectively to advise Luke.

I want a comic for Leia's training, as I believe a story without an external conflict lends itself to the medium. Being able to physically see Leia as a Jedi, assembling her own lightsaber, would be cool for me, and since it wouldn't work in a movie I'd love to see it in a comic. But if they don't think that would sell I'd settle for a novel.

So we get a force ghost Han that meets with Kylo that eventually wins him over to the Light Side. This moment didn’t really make sense to me as Han being a force ghost in the first place makes no sense. Also Kylo never really cared about what his dad had to say in the first place. I mean he killed the guy. So I thought, who else could that be that turned Kylo?

And then, the perfect answer came to me...Anakin. Who else better to explain the internal battle between the Light Side and the Dark Side than the great Jedi council member turned Sith Lord turned savior of the rebellion.  Also, it’s been shown to us over and over again how much Kylo worships his grandfather. He worships his mask. Little did he know that Anakin killed the emperor the first time. Anakin breaking that news to him and explaining how much the dark side cost him could help Kylo see the light. It’d be super impactful. 

It would sit better with fans as well I think, knowing that it was because of Anakin’s influence that the Force was balanced at the end. The prophecy was still true in a clear way on screen instead of it being a debate amongst fans. Also I think everyone would’ve loved to see Hayden make one last appearance. Not to mention he has the highest midichlorian count in universe (😉) so no one would question him coming back as a force ghost unlike Han.

Well R2-D2's name, the ""R2"" part is his model number, so there are probably hundreds, if not thousands of R2's.  It would be like calling your dog by it's breed...

StarWars,"There’s a lot of quiet in Star Wars really only filled with the TV shows and comics, while the shows and comics are all good in their own way I think the majority of people who like Star Wars still want a great Star Wars movie.

This “quiet” I’m referring to are the timeskips in between the films, minus the sequels who seem to take place almost back to back. The main ones being the 19 years between revenge of the sith and a new hope and the 30 years between Return of the Jedi and The force awakens. With the smaller ones of 10 years between episodes 1 and 2 and 2-3 years between episodes 2 and 3. I’m not mentioning the time gaps between the sequels because I personally wouldn’t want a Star Wars story inbetween any sequel film, possibly during one though from a different perspective during the events is an interesting idea.

With the “decanonisation” of a lot of media in the Star Wars universe this left a lot of blank slates to fill. There are a lot of stories I’d love to see on the big screen, brining ashoka to the big screen, possibly a retelling of the starkiller story, a clone focused story between episodes 2 and 3, or the complete reverse an empire loyalist film about stormtroopers, showing anakin and obi-wan on adventures while training before the clone wars. There’s a lot of potential stories and a lot of room to fit them into.

A prime candidate was “Kenobi: A Star Wars Story” but is instead being worked as a series and that’s fine. Although I do worry because, I think we can agree that some parts of The Mandalorian felt stretched, maybe chalk it up to a first season going through its trial run and finding its feet.

I think the majority of the fans think Rogue One is the best Star Wars film released under Disney and I agree it is for many reasons but it renders down to a grittier Star Wars film with down to Earth characters. Plus the Vader scene alone is pure gold. 

Rogue one is pretty much what I personally want in a Star Wars movie today the force users and lightsabers take a step back for an intimate and relatable human story, but then when the force and lightsabers do appear it makes them all the more impressive and impactful.

It’s a shame that Solo was a monetary flop, it had a lot of things working against it, it wasn’t a particularly demanded character to make a story about, it was the later film of the month after Avengers Infinity War and Deadpool 2 had been released and overall the film itself felt like a cut together recap of a Han Solo based series instead of a solid origin story.

With that said I think Solo provided a viable set up for continuing the Star Wars story mindset but through a connected side trilogy instead of one offs that connect to the main films, especially with the Maul cliffhanger. But I’m comfortable with either one as long as good stories are told well, although since solo didn’t perform well I think Disney are leaning away from the Star Wars story films for now.

As for a new full on trilogy that’s potentially completely new I really want Disney to take their time because the sequels not only felt rushed and threw together at times but the main problem is that there is virtually no consistency of storytelling between each film in the sequels. They need to take their time and dedicate a single story with a single identified vision. No bringing in different directors with completely different visions, no dropping them into a story with a setup that doesn’t work for them and no attempts at vitoing any made decisions. None of that. And if it’s bad? Then it’s bad. But at least put some good thought and determined commitment into it.

The problem with the mystory elements is that some of them are never redeemed. I have no idea who the Knights of Ren are.

  
A big problem both of his movies have is the lack of pauses, although it is much worse in ROS. Both movies are always leaping from one activity to the next.

  
Another problem is that ROS is really bad on two levels. If you look at it as a movie it has the above-mentioned pacing problems. If you look at it from a story perspective, especially if you take the whole trilogy into account, you get plot holes unsolved mystories and reversions of story arcs. Especially the decision to make Rey a Palpatine removes all the meaning from TLJ. If J. J. Abrams wanted Rey to be a Palpatine he could have set that up by writing the overarching storyline for the trilogy.

  
As you might have noticed I think if you intend on making a movie trilogy you start by writing an overarching storyline. Of course, you can tweak it while making the movies, but if you make them one by one you can easily get problems. If you want to argue that the original trilogy wasn't made as a trilogy, you are right, but after the success of TLH Lukas had at least planned ahead for ROTJ.

  
This problem was only partly created by J. J. Abrams and mostly Disneys fault.I am not saying that TLJ is the best Star Wars movie, but as a movie, it is definitely the best of the sequel trilogy.

A band of creative brothers and I will be making a full lengthed Star Wars fan film. And I need your help in thinking of a title for it. Obviously, if you're able to help, you'll be credited in the movie! 🙂 

PLOT:
This film will take place after the events of Star Wars: VI: The Return of the Jedi but concludes minutes before the events of Star Wars: VII: The Force Awakens. 
It follows protagonist, Bruce. A former Stormtrooper with the Galactic Empire. Who, since the events of The Return of the Jedi has been traveling from galaxy to galaxy searching for nothing more than inner tranquility. 
Bruce reluctantly befriends a girl, who for now will be called, The Messenger. From her, Bruce learns about the First Order's plan to eliminate the Resistance, and the New Republic's plan to back the Resistance.
He also learns that The Messenger has secretly been exchanging and getting information from two different people, inside the First Order and the Resistance. Both of which don't want to be part battle.
Wanting to fight against the Resistance and the New Republic, but unwilling to join the First Order due to their hallowing methods of recruiting future Stormtroopers, Bruce teams up with The Messenger and the two from the First Order and Resistance. 
His plan to eliminate General Leia Organa directly. 
Before doing so, the First Order and Resistance learn of Bruce's Galactic Empire past and his current plan. While one attempts to recruit him and the other tries to eliminate him. They both also learn about the betrayal of one of their troops and the Messenger.

He had become the Emperor’s chief lieutenant, just like his father, Darth Vader. The struggle had been great within him, and only with the help, and the friendship, and the love of Leia and Han had he been able to break free.…”

StarWars,"I've recently been rewatching the Clone Wars series including the final season as the come out week by week, and I honestly feel like episode 3 would need to be remade. There's just too much of a lack of emotion in the characters towards so many things when you go back and rewatch the movie. There's no emotional ties to the clone army. The whole scene between Obi Wan and Grievous make it seem like it's their first time meeting when it's contradicted by the CW series. Anakin still lacks a depth of character to him, as do the others in some instances. They just don't feel like battle hardened Jedi/soldiers/whatever you would like to call them. It's just jarring to see the stark contrast between the two mediums. 

I understand that the CW series came way after the movie to fill in the gaps between episodes 2 and 3, but in doing so it makes me want more out of RotS. I know with these last four episodes of the series it'll cross over into episode 3 so there will be some retconning/reimagining of some scenes from the movie, but I feel like that wouldn't be enough. Does anyone else feel this way? If this has been discussed on the sub before, I apologize.

StarWars,"The show as a whole is good. The early episodes are alittle too campy but everything is in high gear and primo quality by season 3. This is not putting down any other aspect of the show just highlighting what I think is the strongest arc of it.

To me the Clones are the best part of the show because despite looking the same and having the same voice actor they seem like real people with very different traits and personalities. In contrast despite the droids being made more intelligent and vocal for the show they by design come of as still same same compared to each other.

I just re-watched the general Krell arc and to me this is the best arc of the show because it highlights the individuality of the clones, their ability to move past their programming and make real choices for real principles. Not to mention the tragedy of their eventual brainwashing and turning on their friends.

Whats more this arc stirs in me a emotional response the likes of which the rest of the show cant evoke. When the clones are sent by krell to attack umbarrans posing as clones only to realize they have been killing each other this really hit home. I actually teared up alittle bit cause you felt the pain. There are episode from shows every now and then that just hit you. The Krell arc hits me with the same emotion i felt when watching (showing my age reference) the fresh prince of belaire which normally is a stupid campy show but the episode when Will accidentally gives carlton speed or the episode when wills dad comes back and the leaves again and uncle Phil hugs him at the end. Thats the same emotion I felt in this arc.

After re-watching this im actually surprised this was on cartoon network during the daytime hours given how violent the show is especially this arc. Usually the censor doesnt let straight up gunfights or on screen deaths get through.

StarWars,"Yeah it’ll make them an unconventional pace and structure from past Star Wars movies. The way I see it, if they want to make movies with the legacy actors, and I know fans clamored for that, and also have them bring new fans in, they have to explain this 30 year gap narrative hole they put themselves in. 

It’s either that, or dump the legacy actors outright. I personally thought Mark did a good job as old Luke, but the others weren’t anything special, especially Lando... sorry.)

The only reason some people have said it was good was because we were so starved of a good Star Wars game (Battlefront 2 is really good though, I recommend that you guys check it out) Then, Fallen Order came along.

The biggest talking I just can’t get around is the graphics. The scenery in the game is nice, but the actual graphics of the gameplay is something I just can’t get around. I’m not a sucker for graphics, but if you’re going to release a Triple-AAA game in 2019, you might as well make the game look like it was meant to be released in 2019. The graphics were just NOT GOOD.

StarWars,"I believe Disney has thoroughly ruined Star Wars. Or at the very least twisted into a sad shell of what it once was to me; a window into another universe of wonder and deep imagination, full of diverse life and characters all with different stories and trials to overcome. 

The Original Trilogy started with a Galaxy on the brink of civil war, and then later turn into an actual war, and the ending of said war, which was supposed to be final, more or less. 

The Prequels showed us the rise and fall of one of the most influential movie villains of all time. 

Sure, each of these trilogies had large-scale wars happening during their stories, but the stakes weren't always at the max right at the beginning, and going non-stop even after the movie ends. The Galaxy wasn't *always* in danger of some great peril right then and there. There wasn't some kind of endgame happening in each movie. We had scenes of character development, and growth. Of actual *story building.*

All it's been reduced to is pretty colors, flashy fight scenes, and an occasional spoken line about some large plot point. And the plot doesn't even make sense.

StarWars,"Posted this about a week ago. Still looking for opinions.

Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.

Which leads to my current dilemma. I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.

I am completely torn on this because she Loves it and I kind of like it but I am a big ""Risk mitigation"" kind of person that wholeheartedly believes in controlling the controllables and being happy with results after that and so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.
Any help is appreciated.",Anakin Baby Name? [Long]
StarWars,"I think that at the end of Rise of Skywalker both Rey and Ben were Jedi. If you think back to episode 8 ben had Jedi training. He was used and twisted by the dark used just like anakin was. Which leads me to one of my biggest complaints about Rise of Skywalker. Ben died. I understand the poetic justice of it but at the end of the day it the movie would’ve been better if he hadn’t died. Think about it. In every trilogy there was one main romantic duo. In the prequels it was anakin and padme, in the original trilogy it was luke I mean Han and Leia. The fact that it was 3 movies in the making for that to finally happen, all that anticipation, just to be let down like that. And I know some people didn’t want them to kiss but like I said every trilogy had a couple. 

Imagine all the theories we could’ve formulated if he hadn’t died.Assuming he didn’t die, Rey and ben *kiss* they leave exegol with the resistance and they go to the base to say their goodbyes to their friends. They then leave and head for Luke’s island.  Or some other isolated location. The war is over and just like Han and Leia they settle down and start a family. Just like the Skywalker way they have twins. A boy and a girl. Rey and Ben along with the help of force Jedi before them start the new jedi order. Years go by and new force sensitive people appear all across the galaxy to be trained into Jedi. (Alternate theory with the war over and the force finally balanced there is no more conflict. Rey and ben have kids and die of old age happily married.)  Somehow, someway, palpa- kidding lol. Some new threat that I couldn’t care less about naming or giving a backstory to finds a planet with sith holocrons on it and learns the ways of the darkside. Then said sith vows to destroy the Jedi for some backstory reason. Oh and Ashoka could be in it. There’s been other theories by people that have said Ashoka is alive and she just went into hiding.

StarWars,"Just finished the movie (very late to the game, I know) and if anyone could answer/expand on these questions, I'd be grateful. I have a million thoughts going through my head right now, so sorry if something here was actually explained in the movie and I missed it!

Alright, here it goes:

1. What's up with the Palpatine cult on Exegol? Why is there a planet full of people stanning Sheev's wrinkly ass? What do they get out of giving him life support and building his crazy fleet for decades? Where did these guys even come from??
2. That brings me to the fleet. How did Palpatine have the cash and tech to build a fleet so advanced it has death star lasers on every ship? Even at the height of his power, with all the tech and money at his disposal, the best he could do was the death star and then death star 2.0. Are the Palpatine cultists secretly genius engineers rolling in cash? Does exegol just happen to have all the materials needed to build a fleet of that size? My best guess is this was a long work in progress from maybe even before he became emperor, but that's still a stretch and it doesn't explain why he didn't use exegol and his possibly genius cult until after he hit the sack.
3. Why would palpatine go to all this trouble to build a massive fleet in secret only to announce it to the whole galaxy? Wouldn't it be better to surprise attack the galaxy? I didn't really see any point of his whole broadcast, but Palpatine has always had a flair for the dramatic so I guess he wanted to take over in style.
4. How is Rey related to Palpatine again? I wasn't 100% clear on that. I read that Rey's father was Palpatine's clone/son, but how would that make Rey so force-sensitive? I might be mistaken but I thought it was extremely hard to make force-sensitive clones, unless it was just some kind of coincidence that she happened to be so strong with the force.

I guess my questions are mostly about Palpatine. I was following along up until the Palpatine cult, but after that it's all complicated for me. Thanks!","Just watched TRoS and I have many, many questions"

StarWars,"Do we have any answer as if the force is instantaneous or not? Because as far as we know there is actual science behind the force with midichlorians. So initially I’d guess the force is as fast as probably your neurons transmitting signals to each other which would be up to 268mph. However, as we’ve seen with the force dyad and even essence transfer, it seems that either the force is just instant or literally creates wormholes and goes through them to transmit signals in a seemingly instantaneous matter. Based on probability, Palpatines essence transfer traveled at least 10,000 light years away given that exogol is on the outer rim of the galaxy. Do you think that he instantly essence transferred to another body or that it took some time and he was traveling through space for a while.

StarWars,"I assume Star Wars ships follow our real world rules, where the amount of fuel (Tibanna gas? Coaxium?) necessary to power a ship is directly proportional to the ship's mass. That being said, I think that once you get to ships that are a kilometer long and over, that fuel becomes a really big problem. A freighter like the Millennium Falcon might need only a few kilograms of fuel, but a Star Destroyer or even a Super Star Destroyer would need a ridiculously massive amount of fuel proportional to its mass. How the hell do they power those things? In order to run the *Executor* for a day, you would probably need to harness the entire power output of Planet Earth, and that probably wouldn't be enough to cover the hyperdrive and weapons systems.

It gets even hairier when we get into superweapon status, where not only does said vessel have to power itself, but it has to power a planet killing superlaser. It's established that the Death Stars utilize kyber crystals to enhance and focus energy, but in order to generate even a fraction of the power needed to vaporize a planet, they would need a reactor with a level of output that could rival a star. And what would power that reactor? No amount of coaxium or Tibanna gas would be physically or financially reasonable in this case. Starkiller Base is exempt here, as we know it draws its power from a nearby star. But what about the Xyston Class Star Destroyers from *The Rise of Skywalker*? Given that they have Death Star tech shrunk down into a cannon several hundred meters long, I imagine the weapon runs on some sort of exotic fuel, but where do they get this power from? Is there a special refueling station for planet killers? How do they generate this fuel? So many questions.

I know this is a relatively mundane question in the Star Wars universe, but without fuel, ain't nobody going nowhere. And given the fact that the Star Wars 'verse has some of the biggest starships in all of science fiction, I think it is reasonable to speculate just how commonplace/accessible fuel is in Star Wars.",What powers the superweapons and really big ships in Star Wars?
StarWars,"Timothy Zahn wrote a short story in which Grand Admiral Thrawn completed a solo mission for Vader. I believe the Emperor was unaware of the mission. This story is not Canon now. However, I came away believing at the time that Vader and Thrawn met somewhat frequently in and around the Unknown Regions. I assert that the Emperor tasked Vader to report on the Imperial presence in the Unknown Regions. I thought that over time Vader and Thrawn developed a mutual respect for each other. I also believed they knew that the Empire would be better served with new leadership. I thought it would have been a great story. Vader and Thrawn preparing to destroy Palpatine and together rule their envisioned Empire. A plan evolving over some years. In secret, Vader would have had his arms,legs and organs regrown from cloning. I believe Sidious falsely claimed that Vader's shell of a body made it impossible to accept regrown organs and limbs. Sidious knew Vader,if whole, would become far more powerful than himself. In my mind, Vader had an apprentice in the Unknown Regions overseen by Thrawn. Vader and Thrawn knew the Rebels were an enormous threat. Both were against the creation of both Death Stars. And the Empire was streched too thin. The plans of the Lord and Admiral would restructure many things.

StarWars,"Not really going to follow this all the way through but I always felt the titles of the new films vs the plot of the films left a lot to be desired.

The Force Awakens. I'm thinking there's a huge awakening. People all over the galaxy suddenly have this connection to the world around them. New force users born or infused with the gift. Similar to Legend of Korra Airbenders are all but extinct and than BAM there's a huge awakening and people are scared.

In this version Kylo Ren (who killed the last of the jedi and sent Luke into exile still a valid plot point) would dispatch the Knights of Ren to hunt down and purge any new force users. (great great potential right like the Nazguul for The great eye, but never used)

Meanwhile Leia and the what probably should be an established and recgonized republic army by now track down to save and train as many as they can. Leia completed her training with Luke but understands she is way in over her head, she can't possibly lead the republic against the Order and train new jedi. She needs Luke. All still valid.

When Ren stops at the village massacre and looks at Finn, you think its cuz Finn didn't shoot. Kylo ignores it. But really in that Moment Finn was also hit by the Awakening. This opens it up for Finn and Rey to be Jedi

This also opens the films up for a, say, 10 year time jump. I loved the visual at the end of Last Jedi. The boy growing up with stories of the resistance and being saved by them and using the force to grab the broom. PERFECT ITS AN AWAKENING. Flash forward to see this new generation of force users.

They aren't being killed. They are being taken. To be siphoned. To power and drain the solar energy to power a factory combined with the siphoned force energy to create LIFE. This idea comes from The Old Republic. Weapons, droids, armor, everything being created from thin air almost magically.

And Rey IS a nobody. Like Kylo said let it die man. Star wars is infinite. This is new. Get away from Skywalkers and Vader and Palpatine. In my version Rey would be a nobody like the kid at the end of Last Jedi. Nobody from nowhere. But that's exactly what makes them special.

Obviously there's a lot of gaps in here I haven't filled in. And its easy to to just plug and play when the templates were already laid out. But thats exactly why these movies could've been so much better, because the templates were all there the material was all there. So many good ideas to pull inspiration from.

The Last Jedi isn't, they're all out there.
Rise of Skywalker I would've loved to see the teachings and beliefs of Luke Skywalker, the way of Skywalker, be passed down. This new philosophy of ""time it is for the Jedi to end, to look passed old books"" This idea would be called the way of Skywalker. The jedi term and way of life are replaced by the skywalker term and way of life. Like calling someone a Knight or a Samurai, Skywalker is now a term. The Rise of Skywalker is the rise of this new breed of force users. People like Finn and Rey who are neutral or grey Jedi. Think Jedi Outcast. Blaster toting, lightning using, saber weilding wanderers of good.",How it could've ended
StarWars,"You're hired to direct the second movie in the new Star Wars trilogy. You sit down to start the process of writing, well before TFA has finished post-production. You seperately have lunch with Lawrence Kasdan and coffee with J.J. Abrams. You even probably get to see a rough cut of the film. The first thing you realize is that the entire plot revolves around tracking down Luke Skywalker, who has disappeared onto an island for... some reason? J.J. and Larry don't really have any particular trajectory in mind so you're left to come up with a good reason why the heroic Jedi of the OT has exiled himself.

There has to be a good reason why he would be here, despite the peril in the galaxy. You decide immediately that it can't be cowardice or selfishness. It has to be an active, positive reason. You are led to an interesting notion, one that might really provide a shake-up while preserving the characters integrity. Luke has come to the conclusion that the Jedi are fundamentally flawed, perpetuating a cycle of conflict, and that they need to go away so that the light will rise from another source to overcome the Dark Side. Luke genuinely believes he's doing the right thing for the galaxy and suddenly his exile becomes an act of self sacrifice; he is carrying the burden of knowing that his family and friends are fighting this war but he chooses not to engage with the conflict.

Okay, that sounds interesting. So what story could you possibly come up with that would've led Luke to this kind of conclusion? There has to be a convincing reason why he thinks the Jedi need to end. There's obviously 30+ unseen years after ROTJ that you could explore, but you've got a lot of story to continue telling for all the new characters and you can't spend too much time exploring the past. Do you consider flashbacks? That's never really been done in Star Wars but it seems necessary. You decide to focus on one moment that will serve as both the catalyst for Ben Solo's still unexplained turn to the Dark Side, and a dramatic, personal failure on Luke's part. 

You conceptualize a scene where Luke discovers that Ben Solo has been manipulated and all but turned to the Dark Side. Just as in TESB, he sees a vision of future; of the death and the destruction of everything he loves at the hands of Kylo Ren. For ""the briefest moment of pure instinct"" he fearfully grabs his lightsaber, but immediately recoils in shock. With shame, he looks down to see the frightened face of his nephew, but before he can explain himself Ben attacks. He wakes to find his temple burning to the ground and all of his students slaughtered. The weight of an unimaginable guilt and sorrow comes crashing down as he looks on helplessly. It would be enough to break any man. This is all his fault. He has completely and utterly failed.

You now have a traumatic moment of heartbreak and misunderstanding that serves effectively to change Luke in profound way, but you know the story can't end there. This is a truly dark place for this character, but you now have to bring him back to a place of redemptive heroism. You decide on a scene where Yoda appears to Luke to have one last lesson. To show him that failure doesn't define him and that the galaxy does still need the Jedi. As you think about the climax of Luke's story arc you realize that you want him to face Kylo Ren, but Kylo can't die. And you don't want Kylo to kill Luke in battle, effectively repeating Han's death. You want Luke to die on his own terms, with peace and purpose. So you're led to the idea of a Force Projection. This would allow Luke to reunite with Leia and face Kylo, outsmarting him in the process. 

Add to that some moments of visual storytelling. At the beginning of the first act you have Luke throw away his Father's lightsaber. In the second act you have him refuse it again after revealing the truth of his worst failure. Then, at the climax of the story, you have Luke choosing to appear with that same saber, symbolising that he has finally accepted it from Rey. He has reclaimed his legacy, overcome his failure and returned as the hero that will single handedly save the Resistance and spark a ""new hope"" in the galaxy. In a moment a poetry and rhyming that would do George Lucas proud, he peacefully becomes one with the Force under the light of a binary sunset. His journey has come full circle.",You just got hired to direct Episode 8!
StarWars,"And goddamn it if it wasn’t my favorite piece of Star Wars anything in the Disney era. The story was engaging, the characters were compelling, the relationships were believable, the music was fucking God-tier. This game had me tearing up several times. I seriously haven’t been this happy with a Star Wars game since KOTOR, and platformers aren’t really my thing, which should tell you something about how much I loved this game. If you enjoy video games, even casually, this is, in my opinion, a must play. Enjoy :)",Just finished Jedi: Fallen Order...
StarWars,"I'm pretending Rey married Kylo Ren in my story and that Darth Vader and the other members of the Skywalker family didn't die. I also pretend the story is set about 1 month after The Rise of the Skywalker

Rey is walking in the streets in Tatooine and sees Darth Vader

Darth Vader: are you Rey Palpatine?

Rey: yeah that's me. Who are you?

Darth Vader: I'm Darth Vader and i am your grandfather-in-law

Rey: what?!

Darth Vader: I'm your husband's mother's father

Rey: yeah i know exactly how I'm related to you. I'm just surprised because i thought you died about 30 years ago

Darth Vader: i didn't die. I just pretended to be dead because i was afraid people wouldn't accept me. I killed your grandfather (who is now my co-grandfather-in-law) in order to save your uncle-in-law (my son Luke) but i told him to lie that i died electrocuted

Rey: you actually think you killed my grandfather. 1 month ago i met him, i fought him and i convinced him to turn good

Darth Vader: really? Wow",Rey meets Darth Vader
StarWars,I'm currently playing Battle Front 2 and it's a really engaging plot even if your just doing the main story-line. I like how they finally give Emperial soldiers some attention in this game. It's got me wondering if maybe like the Mandalorian a series or movie should be made that focus's on storm troopers and them fighting rebels. I like the idea of rebels being the bad guys for once because there were if I'm not mistaken lots of factions and I think it'd be interesting to see a faction that committed terrorist acts and were full of extremists and to have a group of storm troopers charged with going after them but for the story to ultimately end with the surviving troopers questioning their loyalty to the Empire.,Think we'll ever get a movie/series based or centered around empire soldiers?
StarWars,"I think it’s use in TROS was pretty terrible, to be honest. It’s overly powerful, seemingly no draw backs to using it (at least for Rey) and it’s pretty much a deus ex machina ability. It’s potential is so powerful, that my nerfs will be pretty big.

It also has no basis in current canon, other than Mando which came out at the same time. I’d improve this too. 

Balance tweaks:

It takes a long time in meditation before the skill is usable. Length required depends on the severity of the wound, as well as skill with the power. 
Example.. if Kenobi knew the power, he still wouldn’t have been able to heal Jinn because it would’ve taken too long.

It would require a very long time of dedicated training to become able to use it at all. I’m thinking long enough that all skilled practitioners would be very old (assuming they’re human). I would write the skill so that it would be almost solely used by alien species with longer life spans. A new Jedi rank would be created for healers, as their skills would be pretty much just limited to healing, so their saber and other force abilities would be on par with an average padawan. They’d be like the party healer in an MMO.
 
I wouldn’t have the power be about life force transfer, but about midichlorian manipulation. It is strenuous to use, so the frail may expire from using it too much. My idea here is that it’s the light side version of what Plagueis can do




Story improvements (setting up healing as an ability):

I would have Yoda mention it was something he used to be able to do, whilst he is on his deathbed with Luke. He’d only bring it up after Luke says “but Master Yoda, surely there must be a force ability to help you”

There would be a couple of scenes in episode 2 where some older padawans, nearing their trainings end, would go with a Jedi Master healer to start their training down those lines. Yoda would say to Obi Wan something about how he thinks Anakin would’ve been good at it, if he was calmer and chose that route.

In episode 3, I would have a healer accompany Windu and his chosen masters when they attempt to arrest Sheev. Fisto would suffer more minor injuries instead of just dying, and Windu takes up a role of keeping Sidious engaged so the healer can help Fisto. In the end, Windu accidentally leaves an opportunity for Sidious, which he takes, and fires a harsh bolt of lightning at the healer which kills him instantly.



My story improvements are minor in terms of the plot, but it does show its rules and limitations whilst making it actually feel a part of the Jedi skill set. What do you guys think? I hope you like my ideas :)","Force Healing, how I’d balance and improve it."
StarWars,"I really don't understand what they were going for with the whole ""anyone can be a great Jedi"" message in TLJ. What's the point of communicating that when the protagonist is naturally gifted anyway? By the end of TFA, Rey is already powerful, altruistic and surrounded by people who appreciate her, so how is that message supposed to be compelling at all? 

Compare this to Ratatouille for example, which also has a similar ""a good chef can come from anywhere"" message. I don't think that movie would have worked if everyone was just fine with the idea of Remy being a chef to begin with. Another example is Shazam, which has a similar 'orphaned child finds belonging' story. Billy's character arc would not have worked if he wasn't the same selfish kid with a sugar-coated memory of his childhood. 

Wouldn't it have been better if Rey was an actual nobody with minimal force sensitivity and didn't win some cosmic genetic lottery? I think that is one reason I like Kenobi. He's not the most powerful Jedi, but he's certainly one of the greatest.",Rey's main character trait
StarWars,"I think a big portion of fans that complained about CGI during the prequel trilogy was only because the inclusion of the green screen made Star wars different from what they had with the original trilogy. That's the only conclusion that I can think of because prequels CGi isn't bad at all.  I would say TPM and ROTS CGI was amazing for the time. 

What I remember when I first watched ROTS as a kid back in 2005 I was stunned for the visual effects and I would say that Revenge of the sith still looks great till this day.

What really makes me angry about this is that people only complained about CGI in Star Wars while was pretty common in most movies of time.",Prequels CGI hate was pretty stupid.
StarWars,"1. In The Clone Wars 2008 movie, Obi-Wan said he put in a request for a new padawan, and they were on their way. According to a mixup (or will of the force); Ahsoka became Anakin's apprentice. So why did Obi-Wan not end up getting one for the duration of TCW.
2. In EP3, why did the Separatists not recognize Anakin on Mustafar? Palatine said Darth Vader his new apprentice would meet them, and then Anakin shows up? Wouldn't the Separatists freak out seeing Anakin Skywalker, they guy who made them lose numerous battles during the Clone Wars?",2 questions: Why didn't Obi-Wan get a padawan in TCW; and Why didnt the Separatists recognize Anakin in Ep 3.
StarWars,"We all know the Vader Intro scene, Han shot first, and Yoda lifting the Xwing moments make these characters look like total badasses.

But what obscure, maybe even looked over, moments stand out where a Star Wars character looks pretty badass?

My example is in TPM when Maul is walking backwards and opens a door by flinging a piece of scrap metal.  Pretty cool for Maul but I always loved how Obi Wan is walking calmly following him twirling his lightsaber.  Always thought Obi's calm walk was badass.

What other obscure moments made a character look like a badass?",Obscure Moments Star Wars characters look Badass...
StarWars,"I want to experience the story so badly, as its something that people hail as one of the best stories in Star Wars. I downloaded the game on my phone, ipad, computer, you name it. But no matter what, I couldn’t get past the gameplay. It feels so slow and boring, the graphics are so old and dated that i cant enjoy it. After playing for a few hours, I just get bored and delete the game. I keep going back to try it every few months but just can’t do it. Its one of the worst things about being spoiled by current gen games like Battlefront II where the game is so engaging and immersive and so great.

Has anyone been in this position, and if so, how have you gotten through it?

Edit; someone suggested a save editor to make going through the battles really easy and quick! I’m going try this and will let you guys know how it goes if anyone remotely cares",Help me get past my issues with KOTOR
StarWars,"I belong to the more sceptic group of the prequels and one of my issues was the CGI Quality and overall look of a lot of scenes.

I rewatched the prequels on my 4K OLED and Disney + (European so its quite new here) and I was pleasantly surprised just how great the movies look. Some stuff cant be salvaged (Droid fights Episode 1 or the cannon coat landing scene in Episode 2) but overall the movies look amazing. 

Its not good HDR in a sense of high brightness contrast but otherwise I doubt the movies ever looked better. 
Especially the pod race in Episode 1 looks incredibly colorful and imaginative.

Mild spoiler
StarWars,"I'm not a super fan of Star Wars, kinda new to it. But I have a theory depending on the answer to this question:  
Did the Jedi's efforts to make all Force masters saints, and the Sith's efforts to keep only two truly evil Force masters alive at one time develop this black and white that the Force draws people to, or is it just the Force's will to make most of those sensitive to it either Dark or Light?

To elaborate, if the Force simply seeks a balance between Light and Dark, and the Jedi only train and accept saints; then the only option is to make truly evil individuals stand to balance it out. Especially if the Sith eliminate most exiles that don't live up to the Jedi council's expectations. If the Jedi have created this ""no grey can exist within the Force"" rule and the Force is following it, then have they actually been doing more harm than good the whole time by making those on the dark side so cruel and powerful?",What came first? The black and white of the Force? Or the efforts from the Jedi and Sith?
StarWars,"I have been thinking too much about the logistics in the starwars movies.  
In th sequals we have been told the first order is a smaller force of empire remnants and child soldiers but then they lose massive structures like star killer base and their flagship (greatly damaged at least).  


Now we see that the first order and later the final order still had enough material and manpower to build and maintain an navy. Where did these factions get their soldiers, officers and other personal from?  


Now the movies do not go into this and are happy to just spawn these men in as respawning npcs but how could this problem be approached from a logical standpoint.  


I first thought that cloning would have been a good solution. The sith have used clones before during the republic and it would not be out of character to fall back on them again but recently I had another thought.  


What if part of these stormtroopers are just, advanced, droids in stormtrooper uniforms? I think this would have made some sort of sense and be an interresting plot point giving more reason why the stormtroopers may never take of their helmets ect.","droid stormtroopers, a solution to the manpower problem?"
StarWars,"To start off, I'm grateful we're getting this, and props to the entire team for making this happen. It's definitely better than nothing at all.

But the past two arcs have been underwhelming to an extent, and overall didn't seem to advance the story in anyway. And you see this wouldn't necessarily be a problem except we're only getting 12 episodes. You'd think the 12 we were getting would be crucial to the final points of the story.

The Bad Batch Arc was nice, we got to see Anakin and the clones again. But what exactly did it accomplish? I feel like with Echo coming back and Wat Tambor saying ""he'll make a return on his investment"" we might see something similar to Order 66, or Echo telling Rex about the chip and him removing it. But we really get nothing. The best part of all that was the Anakin and Padme scene, and the Anakin and Trench scene. But if we wanted to see dark-side Anakin Crystal Crisis would've been much better, plus we would've gotten to see a major character (General Grievous) come back.

The recent Ahsoka Arc really didn't need to be 4 episodes.  I know this has been harped on alot, and I tried to stay optimistic until it was over. But Trace literally stays the same throughout the entire arc. Rafa doesn't even seem to like Ahsoka until the final episode when she comes back to rescue her. And the Mandalorians we're teased throughout the last two episodes, didn't do anything to help them escape, and then walk in a tell Ahsoka they have a common enemy. The last 5 minutes of Episode 8 felt so rushed and weird.

Hopefully we get a scene with Dooku, Grievous, or Palpatine. It just seems weird that the 3 major villains of the series haven't been seen atleast once before ROTS.

Overall I'm enjoying Season 7, but the way some of the story is executed makes me scratch my head sometimes. Siege of Mandalore should be good tho.",I feel like Season 7 could've been executed better
StarWars,"“He relaxed and let the force flow through him. Usually, in battle, the force seem to fall silent – not to desert him, but to become no more than instinct. This time, however, Obi-Wan found himself connecting to everything around him - as though he were in a meditative trance. He wasn’t waiting for his Master to guide him. At last, he was guided purely by the Force.

The next few minutes seem to take place in slow motion. Obi-Wan felt no fear as he emerged from behind the loader droid and re-engaged the black guards. Life and death were all the same, within the force; there was nothing to hide from, nothing to distract him. Instead he could perceive the path of every blaster shot before It was fired. His body required no help from his conscious mind to angle his lightsaber to deflect each shot.

Qui-Gon had always encouraged him to enter a meditative trance during combat. Obi-Wan had always thought that absurd, if not impossible.

But now, at last, he fought as his master had taught him.”


Goosebumps.

Edit: Grammar","17 year old Obi-Wan entering a meditative state during combat, as Qui Gon taught him. Quote from “Master and Apprentice” by Claudia Gray."
StarWars,"The Plot of The Last Jedi is almost exactly the same as the plot of The Empire Strikes Back:

1. A rebel base is discovered and attacked, leading to an evacuation and escape attempt by the rebels.
2. Our main hero arrives at a distant planet to be trained by a Jedi Master.
3. The main hero leaves training early to confront their counterpart and receive a revelation about their heritage.
4. Then the main hero hooks back up with the other main characters at the end of the escape.

A film can't be truly original if it's working off an already used blueprint.

Now for the differences:

1. Rey's Jedi Master trainer is over the force/Jedi whereas vs. Yoda who is still into it.
2. There's cool interplay between Kylo and Rey during Rey's training vs. Obi Wan chimes in to encourage Yoda and Luke during his training.
3. The escape is more methodically depicted (a choice which was poorly executed in my opinion. It's kept on it's feet by having characters on both sides make braindead assumptions and decisions that no one in their positions would actually do).
4. Kylo tells Rey her Dad is nobody vs. Vader is Luke's Dad
5. The ""showdown,"" with Rey/Kylo/Snoke mimics the Return of the Jedi final showdown with Luke/Vader/The Emperor, more than the Empire Strikes back showdown.

But to me the ""original,"" elements in The Last Jedi aren't that ""original,"" because they aren't born from an original plot or place. It walks the same line as Empire, but then flips the behaviors of the characters at certain moments. This doesn't involve must more creativity that just straight up copying.

I'm not saying that The Last Jedi deserves hate for this, but it often gets praised over The Force Awakens, because people call it ""more original,"" when really it isn't. And yes, Johnson was locked into a Rey/Luke storyline because of how TFA ended, so that's not his creation, so it's not all on him.

The Force Awakens had more blatantly obvious symmetries to it's original-trilogy counterpart, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the filmmakers would own that themselves. Disney/Abrams never shied away from letting TFA be called a reboot, whereas The Last Jedi has been propped up as an original vision.","Why is TFA criticized for being a reboot, but The Last Jedi isn't?"
StarWars,"I was reading an interesting interpretation of the chosen one in an IO9 article, discussing just who brought balance to the force and how it was done. In the article they harken back to Mortis and how Anakin didn’t stay and become the Father to maintain the balance between the Son and the Daughter. Essentially, the natural balance of the Force was broken after the Father, Son, and Daughter all died. The article comes to conclusions about how this all ties into the Force Dyad and what we got, but it gave me an idea for what might have been.

What if the ending had been Ben and Rey becoming the Son and Daughter, sacrificing their lives to return to Mortis and the natural balance of the Force. When they do, Anakin shows up to become the Father, as he was meant to, and maintain the balance.

I mean, I think it would have been more poetic if this had been done with Luke and Leia, Anakin having seen what his choice to not stay and balance the Force had wrought on his loved ones. Cursed to birth a new Force Dyad and restore the balance with his own children.

But it would work with Rey, Ben, and Anakin as well.",The Ending for the Skywalker Saga that could have tied everything together and resolved the arcs for all the main characters.
StarWars,"I first watched Episodes IV-VI about ten years ago and then decided to rewatch them this week and then continue with the remaining episodes, none of which I had seen before.

Catching up with IV-VI, I loved The Empire Strikes Back best. Didn't care much for Return of the Jedi though as the Ewoks were annoying 🙄

As for the prequel trilogy, which I've just now completed... just wow 😮

Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith were phenomenal! 🤩 The whole back story of Darth Vader was fantastic, lots of nuance, and set against the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith, and the larger political landscape, it makes his personal story one of extremely fine balance between both the light and dark within, which Hayden Christensen portrayed beautifully. It was a slow, tragic descent and painful to see not only the effects on Obi-Wan and Padmé, but also on himself 😢

I wish I could be so generous to The Phantom Menace, but unfortunately, that contained too many of the more childish elements that spoiled Return of the Jedi, and worse still, contained a lot of racial stereotyping. On a rewatch, I would just skip it altogether - the whole Anakin Skywalker story is no less for missing it out.

On to the sequel trilogy next, but this is my ranking of Episodes I to VI so far. Probably going to have unpopular opinions, but that's OK 😄

1. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
2. Episode II: Attack of the Clones
3. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
4. Episode IV: A New Hope
5. Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
6. Episode I: The Phantom Menace

Prequel Era:

- **Dooku: Jedi Lost (audio play)**: Tells the story of Dooku's time in the Jedi Order and why he eventually left.

- **Master and Apprentice (Book)**: *Great* Novel by Claudia Gray about Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on a mission for the Jedi. Really does a lot to enhance their relationship and gives Qui-Gon a lot of character development. Any book by Claudia Gray is a must-read.

- **Dark Disciple (Book)**: This is a must-read for any Clone Wars fans. It's all about Ventress and wraps up her storyline from the show. It was originally going to be an arc before the show got canceled.

Between Episode 3 and 4:

- **Darth Vader (2017) (Comic)**: Tells the story of Vader starting the inquisitors, hunting Jedi, and getting his red Lightsaber. *Very* good comic series with Vader doing a lot of cool stuff while also expanding the lore in interesting and cool ways

- **Ahsoka (Book)**: Story about Ahsoka shortly after Order 66 as she has a run-in with the Inquisitors. Does a good job of explaining her mindset during that period and explains how she got her new lightsabers. A must-read for any Clone Wars/Rebels fans.

- **Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (Video Game)**: Set a few years after Order 66, this game tells the story of a young Jedi who suddenly gets knowledge that could help him restart the Jedi Order. Really fun game with great lore and fun gameplay.

- **new Thrawn trilogy (Books)**: Great novels about Thrawn's rise through the Empire and about the troubles he faces along the way. It also gives a lot of interesting lore about him and his people. Must-read for any Thrawn fan (Including Legends).

- **Lost Stars (Book)**: Really good young adult novel about 2 kids who live under imperial rule and details their lives as they eventually join the empire and have to deal with the horrors the empire inflicts. Does an amazing job of humanizing the imperials while not necessarily sympathizing with them (including showing how the regular soldiers felt about things like the Death Star). It also has a really nice love story.

- **Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel (Book)**: Tells the story of Jynn's parents and expands on the creation of the Death Star. I wasn't even a fan of Rogue One but I loved this novel. It does a good job of showing how the seeds of the empire started even during the Republic Era.


Between Episode 4 and 5:

- **Darth Vader (2015) (Comic)**: Tells the story of what Vader was up to after Episode 4, including his attempts to find the mysterious rebel pilot who blew up the death star. Not quite as good as the other (imo) but still fun and shows Vader being a badass. It also introduces Doctor Aphra, who's a great comic character.


Post Episode 6:

- **Bloodline (book)**: One of the most important books in New Canon (In fact, I would almost call it crucial). It tells the story of Leia's time in the New Republic Senate and reveals what people thought when they found out she was Darth Vader's daughter. More importantly, it details the rise of the First Order and explains who they are and why they do what they do.


Honorable Mentions:

- **Doctor Aphra series (Comic)**: This series had its ups and downs and, while I liked most of it, I didn't like it enough to recommend it. If you really like Aphra in the 2015 Vader series, then read this.

- **Darth Vader (2020) (Comic)**: This has been great so far but it's only been 2 issues so I don't feel comfortable recommending it yet.

- **Rise of Kylor Ren (Comic)**: This series had some good moments, but it felt a little rushed. What we got was good, but I feel like it needed to be longer for me to feel comfortable recommending it. If you're interested in how Kylo fell to the Dark Side and met the Knights of Ren, this is the book for you.

- **Darth Vader: Lords of the Sith (Book)**: This was fun to listen to on audiobook...but that's because I could skip through the boring parts. It has a lot of really cool lore about the sith and Vader's feelings during the OT era, but I can't recommend it as a whole. If you're interested in Vader lore, I suggest checking it out.

As I said, if anyone has anything to add (Even if it's just correcting something I said here) please do! 


I hope this can help some people out!",New Canon Recommendations
StarWars,"So with the Sequel Trilogy now all said and done (and the varying reactions that accompanied it), I guess people are now going to want to start thinking about doing entire Star Wars marathons.

The first choice would be just to do a straight run from Episode I-IV, but as anyone who's used the original Machete Order will attest this can be a lengthy process and doesn't tie the themes and story as nicely together as the MO does. 

So that got me thinking, now that the new trilogy is out, what about extending the MO to include the final three movies? I know that a lot of fans are unhappy with how they turned out, myself included, but perhaps a change of viewing order could help integrate them better into rest of the Star Wars saga. Hear me out.

The order would be like this, in keeping with the original MO of starting at a later episode and jumping back to get the backstory: 

- Episode VII - TFA
- Episode VIII - TLJ
- Episode IV - ANH
- Episode V - TESB
- Episode II - AOTC
- Episode III - ROTS
- Episode VI - ROTJ
- Episode IV - TROS

Think about it. 

You start out with the New Republic, the First Order, Rey, Finn, Kylo, Maz, etc. and see that the Galaxy is in turmoil. Kylo, the grandson of the legendary Sith Lord Darth Vader, is on his destructive rampages, and to oppose him, Rey goes to study under the tutelage of the legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker, only to find out he's a disheveled old man with no interest in helping anyone. 

Just as he redeems himself at the end of TLJ, we jump back to see the origins of *his* story - how he joined the Rebellion, studied under Obi-Wan and Yoda, and found out the evil Darth Vader was none other than his father, Anakin Skywalker. 

Then, we jump back *again*, to see Anakin's origin story, about how he was a promising young Jedi during the Clone Wars, how he fell in love with Padme, and wanted nothing more than to keep her alive and be faithful to the Jedi Order.

Finally, we end up on a ""trilogy of finales"" - first we see Anakin succumb to the Dark Side out of fear of losing Padme, and he drags down the Republic, the Jedi Order and democracy with him, leading to the Empire and the rise of Palpatine. Then straight after, we see Luke, in his final confrontation with the Empire, both redeem his father and defeat Palpatine, leading to the birth of the New Republic and the resurrection of the Jedi Order. Then finally, at the end of everything, we see Rey learn of her heritage, Luke and Leia give Rey the final words of wisdom she needs to confront Kylo and Palpatine, Kylo ultimately turn away from evil and leave the Dark Side, and then Rey - and all the Jedi - take down Palpatine - and all the Sith - once and for all. She ends up burying Anakin's lightsabre on Tatooine, where both Anakin and Luke were from, receiving the approving looks of Luke and Leia, before reclaiming the Skywalker legacy and looking into the sunset. 

In this order Episode I is again unnecessary, since it doesn't really add crucial information about anything other than a couple of throwaway lines in Episode II. Also, this way the story is presented as the Rise, Fall, Resurrection and final defeat of the Dark Side of in the galaxy, as well as being the ultimate destruction of Palpatine and his menace. 

What do you guys think? I'm tempted to get Disney+ just to view all of this at once and see how it goes. I still have my issues with the movies but I think this could make them a lot more compelling to watch. Thoughts?",Machete-Machete Order?
StarWars,"Personally, Kylo Ren was probably my favorite character we got from this Sequel Trilogy (or at least the first two films). That said, I always felt like there was so much more to his backstory. I understand that it has been recently explored in the comics, but I feel like it's also worthy tale to have told on screen.

Imagine this: what if *The Force Awakens* started a little earlier? Maybe one storyline in the film could've been Luke's training with Ben. Throughout the movie, we could slowly see he and Luke beginning to drift apart, and Ben's fascination with the Dark Side increasing. The film could've ended with him abandoning the Jedi code, embracing the darkness, and becoming Kylo Ren. That would've been some amazing character development to see not only for Ben, but for Luke, as well.

I know that the Sequel Trilogy is done and it's probably best to move on. But I can't help but wonder what could've been. Regardless, what are your thoughts on this? I'd love to hear what you all have to say.",Would any of you have been interested to see Ben's fall to the Dark Side in the trilogy?
StarWars,"I tried googling but most results came up talking about prequels or OT. Or just from episode 9. 

I'm sure it's been discussed, if anyone knows a good link to read that'd be helpful. 

Current things I'm unclear about are 

1) What was his plan in episode 6, because apparently he transferred his consciousness (or cloned I assume since he was still conscious in his last scenes) before the last fight. 

2) What is his ultimate plan in episodes 7-9. Is he hoping Snoke dies at the hands of rey/kylo? 

3) He tells kylo to kill rey at the beginning of episode 9. What happens if he succeeds, does he then possess Kylo somehow? 

4) If his final plan involved Rey, he was then somehow hoping that his clone son makes a son/daughter as well? All in the hopes that he can possess him/her?",Spoilers. What exactly was palpatines plan around episode 6 to 9?
StarWars,"The more I watch I feel the more I like Ahsoka above most of the other characters. Sure we have Kenobi (also a favorite), Luke, Yoda, Plo Koon (I just liked his look as a kid and liked him even more when they flesh out his character) but I just feel she is still above the rest. 

First, let me just say I think she’s hands down one of the most badass characters. She survived an encounter with Grievous (TWICE), something several Jedi across different levels of mastery were unable to do. She also stood toe-to-toe with Ventress, hive mind Barris, fought pretty decently against Anakin (Mortis), survives Pre Vizla (even almost beating him), what I can only assume is a fight against Maul which will be cut short, kills an Inquisitor, beats a few more, and then gives VADER a run for his money. She’s also a Clone Wars war hero who performs several outstanding acts throughout: tough fights, saving senator from assassination, protecting younglings, fighting pirates, leading rebels to victory. Oh yea, and she’s only 14-17 throughout her first war. 

Second, she reaches a level of attunement with the Force that we rarely see. She is hinted as still being alive around the time of Ep. 9 and she telepathically communicates with Rey. She’s also purified 2 kyber crystals, something that isn’t really touched upon but seems difficult. And she’s very centered and pretty much the ideal Jedi by the end of her Rebels story. She even goes by Ashla (if I remember right) during her exile, which is later defined as a term for the Force itself. 

Third, she’s just a very well fleshed out character. I think part of the reason I like the character is that it seems to contain the better parts of Anakin and a lot of wisdom. We get to see a full character arc and outcome that gets fleshed out in a book and two series. I feel Rey had potential, but creative differences really soured it in the 8-9 time gap. I also feel like Luke is a GREAT character but gets kind of tarnished a bit because of his depiction in TLJ. I like the movie and depiction of him as a broken man, but we don’t really ever get the development that led him to think of killing his own nephew and abandoning his role. Anakin is obviously a contender, but he has his flaws. If there’s 2 comparable characters to their story and how they got there I feel like Kenobi and Maul are the next two in line.

TL;DR: Ahsoka has a great narrative and character build that make her a favorite character. On the level of Maul and Kenobi in terms of stories and likability. Also she’s just a very strong Jedi and a blend of the better parts of other characters while still unique in her own right. Also Plo Koon is cool.

Sorry this is a long post I just really appreciate the time and effort Lucas, Filoni, and the rest of the LucasFilm team but into making Ahsoka’s character.",Ahsoka
StarWars,"So i recently watched star wars the clone wars and im currently at season 3

I kbow that in season 1 ziro escaped from prison with the help of cat bane and his crew (you can see aurra sing in his crew clearly, thats the point)

After all u can clearly see in the assasination episode that sings tries to kill padme, she fails because asoka interrupts her, after that u can see ziro in prison CLEARLY

So the escape of ziro in season 1 happens AFTER the events of assasination and after boba and sings mission kill windu

But i dont understand how sing can be in banes crew when she lost the fight against asoka, she had to be arrested after this episode, acctualy u can see her how she helps bane (nothing is mentioned about her in that episode btw not from anakin or from asoka this makes no sense at all)
How the fuck can she be in banes crew after she lost the fight against asoka (u cant say she wasnt arrested)",Star wars the clone wars doesnt make sense about aurra sing and escape of ziro
StarWars,"Before you attack me, hear me out. I'm not asking if the prequels should be re written, filmed with better actors or anything. Possibly my biggest problem with the trilogy is it's outdated CGI and overuse of it in Episodes II and III. Whilst there obviously can't be a change to how much was used, it can be updated. Since they have the money, Disney could easily do a ""remaster"" if you will, for the effects in the films. And whilst they're at it, they could also do extended versions. I for one, would love to see Episode III in it's 4 hour version, even if a lot of that content is in The Clone Wars. And as long as the original versions are still available, what harm could it do? (A lesson that George Lucas should have learned.)

TL;DR: The prequels would benefit from better CGI.",Should the prequels be remade?
StarWars,"Thought it was alright. 5/10. Average overall. 

Firstly the writing and continuity is just trash. But that ground work was set long ago in TFA, and also by TLJ having a different director with a vision that clashed with the other director. So the writing is whatever. Like, I'm pretty sure Palpatine had no mention in the previous two films and now here his name just pops up in the scroll? Like what? But again.... whatever.

Where this movie shines is the visuals. It looks pretty damn good. Lovely film grain. Lots of different enivornments. Lots of big vista shots. It's pretty alright. One of the best looking sw films for sure. 

Secondly, a lot of the humour here actually landed for me. I found most of the humour in the previous 2 films kinda cringe but here I actually laughed quite a few times. So props there. 

But then another downside the whole final quarter (or whatever) of the film - the attack on exicil. I felt this wasn't great. Just kinda standard stuff but since it tries to wrap up story elements and, once again, these sequels have godawful writing, then it kinda fails there. And once again the big bad dies wayy to easy. Just like snoke. I mean snokes death was just idioitic with that ""I know EVERYTHING!"" speech and then immediately being blind sided. And now ehre the Emporer shoots about actual sized lightening bolt from his hands and decimates the sky and then he gets undone by someone simply holding a lightsaber? Pathetic. 

All in all I think it's the best of the sequels. I liked that the trio spent time together on adventures, unlike TLJ where they were all split up. TFA was just action set piece after action set piece. I hate that film.

OVerall I don't really count these films as canon tbh. I'm glad they are finished.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and one more thing: How many  times did Abrams do that ""push in"" move with the camera? Goodness he is not a good director.

StarWars,"Something I don't remember seeing much of at all was the timeframe between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I do remember a great deal of exploration of Qui-Gon and his training of Obi-Wan, but I only ever remember a single piece of media involving Padawan Anakin pre-Clone Wars - a cameo appearance in a comic miniseries focused on Jedi Masters doing... something. All I remember is A) Windu and several other masters go to Nar Shadaa, B) while on Nar Shadaa, they encounter a woman who claims her daughter was taken in by the order, and C) a cameo appearance by Padawan Anakin when Ki-Adi-Mundi (I think) sees him chatting away with the half-Tusken padawan A'sharad Hett, Anakin expressing to the master something along the lines of ""I thought all Tuskens were bad people, but this guy's alright"" or somesuch (which, after AoTC, is pretty ""oof"" in hindsight).

Also Racer's Revenge, but I don't even know if that's even part of Legends canon.

I'm sure there was something more, but it just surprises me how little focus that particular timeframe got even at the time - and as for afterwards, all focus (understandably) shifted towards the Clone Wars.

What (mis)adventures did Anakin get up to during his training under Obi-Wan?",How much media actually covered Kenobi's tutelage of Anakin?
StarWars,"so when the last jedi came out, i loved it (and i still do). i remember saying to my friend when we walked out of the theater ‘that was everything i could’ve asked for from a sequel to TFA.’ i went online and was baffled to see so much negative reception and disappointment, i really didn’t get it. in fact it kind of pissed me off, the way anybody who liked TLJ was shot down or dismissed; there’s so much to love about that movie and i was upset that people couldn’t see that.

ENTER TROS. i was scared going into the theater bc i worried the movie couldn’t possibly live up to the first two for me. from the opening crawl i was apprehensive and as the movie went on i became more and more disappointed with the direction it was going and the storytelling choices it made. by the time the last battle came around i was tearing up because i felt NOTHING—here’s the climax i’ve waited three years to see and i don’t even care what happens. the final scene to me was like the cherry on top—i stood up to walk out before JJ’s name even came up. i was angry. i felt jaded. i felt like something I loved had just been ‘ruined’.

so i guess my point is i get it now. the way people were reacting to TLJ is almost the exact reaction I had to TROS. i’d like to apologize to everyone i vehemently defended TLJ to when probably all they wanted to do was rant and vent their frustration. we all like different stuff and to say someone’s wrong for liking or disliking something is invalidating how they felt about it. people have talked over my complaints about TROS and now i realize what people who disliked TLJ went through after that film.

also, i’m just sorry in general to all of us that we didn’t get a better more cohesive trilogy. it sucks to get SO excited about something and have it let you down completely.",an apology
StarWars,"Now I’ve fully enjoyed all SW movies with the exception of AOTC, but that wasn’t what this post is about. Looking back on it, I think the best Star Wars movie released post-OT is ROTS. There’s so many good scenes in this movie. I mean right off the bat it starts off super entertaining with count dooku being killed, and then soon after they foreshadow Anakins inevitable demise with him and palpatine talking and palpatine saying how one must understand all sides of the force. That right there set the tone for the entire movie and kept me hooked the whole time. I think personally my favorite part is the ending after palpatine executes order 66. So much tension after that. Anakin going to the dark and slaughtering all the innocent people, shocking padme and showing he’s never going back. And then one of my favorite fights, not just in the movie but the entire franchise, with obi vs anakin. So many great moments and, imo, a great ending to an otherwise mixed trilogy.

I've read the Revan series, Bane series, original Thrawn trilogy and duology, Asohka, Plagueis, and Dawn of the Jedi. I need to read the Heirs of the Force, but I found out about that series after I already started NJO.

My question: How can Jedi not affect the Yuzhong Vong with the Force, when they can clearly affect inanimate objects such as rocks and bulkheads? I get that the YV are not apart of the Force, for whatever reason (still on book 4), and that a Jedi wouldn't be able Mind Trick or read their thoughts, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to be pushed or thrown if a rock can.",[Legends] Question about Yuzhong Vong
StarWars,"Much like with The Clone Wars, we could see what wasn’t covered in the films and see more of what has and hasn’t been shown in the comics with what lead Ben down his dark path.

It could be either a cartoon or live action depending on if Mark Hamill and Adam Driver want to return.

I’d love to see Luke Skywalker at his most powerful teaching a new generation of Jedi and what Ben did to make him contemplate killing him as he nearly did Vader all those years ago (Perhaps killing and covering up the death of one of his other students with his life being threatened otherwise?).

We could also learn more about Snoke and Palpatines resurrection through cloning and Sith alchemy,maybe establishing how force users can only attempt it once through the dark side with the risk of coming out mangled and weak like he did.

I’d also like to find out how Luke became aware of the two and the existence of Rey since he hinted he knew about her existence and lineage in TROS.Him and Ben communicating with Obi Wan and Anakin until Luke quit and Palpatine corrupted Ben through the voice of Vader would be sweet as well.

Everyone else would be original characters besides the students who have already been established in the comics and we could see the factions that stayed with Luke and the ones who became Knights of Ren leading to their clash that killed the remaining Jedi.

They wouldn’t have to explain away Han,Lando and Leia not being there since it’s at his Jedi training area but could still allow for their appearances if it’s a cartoon or for Chewy and Threepio to be there regardless of the medium if they want.

What do you guys think?",Would anyone else like to see a Star Wars:The New Republic show on Disney Plus staring Luke and Ben that takes place 10 years before the events of Force Awakens?
StarWars,"Hi I've been bored in quarantine and thought up an alternate way the sequel trilogy could've went. Feel free to add to it or comment or whatever  

  

The Force Awakens takes place on only one planet. It's a lush green planet and home to a society of priests and priestesses (clean, minimalist, white and yellow aesthetic and buildings, they're very rich because of a rare mineral found on that planet) and it begins with scenes of a young child training with a stick and meditating, called Rey. She's shown to be talkative around other students (but was always an independent girl) and stubbornly does what she thinks is right. She grew up on tales about Luke Skywalker, who has been gaining a lot of reputation in the galaxy, so she's also very idealistic. She also reads a lot about space battles, adventurers and the like.  

  

The First Order is not like the Empire, but more like a group of people trying to recreate what the Empire was through desperate force. Finn is a stormtrooper with a moral compass, and he's sent with a group to Rey's planet to attack the priest order, they got intel that they might be hiding Luke Skywalker there. They travel on a ship, Finn and an other character get into a fight (they had beef in the past) and Finn gets thrown off of the ship by them. He barely survives, wanders around and finds a group of priests who nurse him back to health, then administer Rey to watch over him. They bond, but Finn does not tell her he's a stormtrooper who wants out of the First Order. Neither of them are aware that Rey is force sensitive, but there are subtle clues.  

  

Han Solo comes into the picture, smuggling supplies to the priests. Before landing with the Falcon, he has an emotional talk with Leia, which feels like goodbye (he makes a remark how their hologram conversations always feel like they're gonna be the last). What he, and others don't know is that the leaders of these priests are conducting illegal experiments on a certain alien species' children (who are being smuggled onto the planet by people like Han, although Han himself doesn't do that). Their aim is to artificially make people Force sensitive and get powers.  

  

Han immeaditely spots how out of place Finn looks amongst the people (no white and golden robes, wounded and confused looking), and strikes up a conversation with him over a drink, at the local bar. Meanwhile, Rey's force sensitivity has been getting stronger lately, and she notices weird patterns that she hasn't before. She also senses the pain of the alien children, and knows something isn't right. She joins Han and Finn at the bar.  

  

The second half starts with the priest society now under attack by Finn's former team. Finn is not the best at aiming but he does know how to handle a gun which makes Rey suspicious. He tells her he used to be a Stormtrooper because now she's a friend of his (and he has a crush on her). They beat Finn's team, Finn shoots the guy who threw him off the ship, but one of the stormtroopers makes a distress call towards the First Order. A bigger ship will arrive soon.  

  

Rey has a conversation with Han about how Finn can't be trusted. Han agrees and reinforces this idea as he had bad experiences with the Empire before. Rey and Han help the priests to come up with a defense plan (not involving Finn in the process). They beat the First Order ship, and in a dangerous situation Rey and Finn are forced to cooperate, saving each others' lives.  

  

Towards the end, Han accidentally finds out the twist about the priest order, and is murdered by the leader. Rey feels a piercing pain in her chest due to the disturbance in the Force, while they're hanging out with Finn, he gets scared but then she starts walking towards where the leader is, and discovers what he's been doing. The final villain is the priest leader who almost kills Finn but Rey saves him at the end. Finn makes a move on Rey later, which Rey declines but they are now trusted friends.  

  

They free the alien children they find, and quickly make their way to the Falcon, where they find a sedated Chewbacca and a couple of priests watching over him. They fight, Chewbacca then wakes up, learns the news of Han's death and is devastated.  

  

Rey, not knowing what to do or where to go, antagonized by her people (and the same goes for Finn, they relate), goes to search for Luke Skywalker, her childhood hero. When she arrives at the island, with the children, she finds Luke and Luke's pilot and helper, a young man called Poe Dameron.  

  

Rey's development in this first movie is about how her views on the world are challenged, with her people committing such horrible deeds and a stormtrooper (a group Rey has only known as evil people) leaving the First Order behind for the right cause. Finn is a bit similar to the original, and Poe has only a cameo at the end.",An alternate sequel trilogy just for fun part 1
StarWars,"So with Disney+ I've finally been able to watch the entirety of Rebels. Im currently at the Episode where they meet Rex, Wolf and Gregor. They say that they removed their inhibitor chips so they didn't execute Order 66. My question is, HOW did they do it? After Fives got his inhibitor chip removed he was deemed mentally unstable. How did Rex and the others manage to get their chips removed without being deemed mentally unstable as well? Before rebels there is never any episode in the clone wars about Rex removing his inhibitor chip. Perhaps that's explained In a comic that I'm not aware about. Also a little side question: How did Rex and Wolf meet Gregor? I'm fairly certain there's a comic about that but I can't find it anywhere. Thank you for reading my question, hope somebody can answer it.",HOW did Rex remove his Inhibitor Chip?
StarWars,"After my first viewing of *The Rise of Skywalker*, my interpretation is that he effectively killed himself. Rey merely defended herself, and he was killed by his own evil. It cemented a theme earlier mentioned that we become the evil we hoped to destroy when we use evil means.

After my second viewing yesterday, I noticed she is actively pushing back the force lightning, which certainly detracts from the mentioned theme.

How do you interpret it? Anyone know what Abrams or the other writers said about it?",Who kills Palpatine?
StarWars,"Movies, Games and TV aside, I’m surprised there has never been any kind of comic book or book crossover between the two since there the most iconic sci fi works in history and the two properties that people think of when the hear the word “Science Fiction”.

Even Marvel and DC have had plenty crossovers and there is rumors of another one being planned for 2021. Why is that?",Why has there never been a Star Wars and Star Trek crossover?
StarWars,"Any chances that we see in future some more with regards to one of the most liked character from the youth back in the days. Many of us grew up with this bad ass renegade stormtrooper who became a jedi and installed a jedi school with luke skywalker. Dark forces/Jedi knight was my all time favourite video game series. I do know that he is out of the game because of the movie rogue one which is now canon. So it was not him who stole the plans of the death star. And that there is kanan jerrus ( sw: rebels)  which has considerable similarities with kyle katarn.

Any slightest changes that he may have a comeback somehow.",Kyle Katarn
StarWars,It blows my mind that Anakin had visions of his turn while confronting the Son and really never did anything to change nor even considered them when confronted with them during the movies. I understand this is mostly because the movies were there before the show but do you all think this is a continuity error or is simply an intentional part of Anakin's personality that is further meant to highlight his arrogance and short sightedness. I personally think this was considered before they finished that arc during the show and meant it to highlight how blinded Anakin was by his own hatred and anger during Episode III. I personally havent seen season 7 of the Clone Wars if there are any spoilers involved please leave it out of this discussion.,Anakin's visions didnt seem to have any effect.
StarWars,"I always thought Ahsoka’s original role in The Clone Wars show was awesome throughout the entirety of the first 6 seasons, mostly costarring with Obi &amp; Anakin  and occasionally getting her own episodes here and there. Then Rebels came along and I loved the show but not as much as Clone Wars so having the Ahsoka tie in was a cool nod to Clone Wars and made me more open to the show. 

Now the majority of the final season of Clone Wars is focused on her...she’s confirmed for Season 2 of The Mandolorian, and apparently Rosario’s contract is a multi-show deal so its likely she could appear in Kenobi or other Disney+ SW shows. Spit balling but whatever. And of course there’s the Rebels continuation series whenever that show is ready. But the character is so overdone at this point it’s really irritating to see her soak up the majority of the screen time in this final season of clone wars. Was really hoping to see more of Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin, along with the rest of the Jedi Council in there final days. 

Sorry for the unpopular opinion and thanks for letting me vent. Lol!",Unpopular Opinion: Ahsoka is overrated.

StarWars,"###Saved by the Gel: Examining How Jedi Hair Length Affects Their Power
___

Power in the Star Wars universe has been the subject of debate between fans for decades. ""Well, Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber, so he is obviously more powerful than Obi-Wan Kenobi!"" ""Yoda is the best Force user in the galaxy, he would destroy anyone else!"" Now, I present to you a fresh perspective: how Jedi hair length affects their power. Does being bald make you a better Jedi? Or having long, beautiful locks? Read on to find out.

___

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell). If I missed a couple, I apologize, please don't burn me at the stake.

**Methodology:**

There are two main data points used in this analysis: 1) hair length and 2) power level. Hair length is easy to break down: bald, short, medium, and long lengths of hair. Power level is a little more complex. It is a weighted average score based on four factors: 1) wisdom, 2) combat ability, 3) leadership, and 4) lightsaber awesomeness. Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.

___

##Table 1: Power Level Weighted Averages

This table is extremely wide, so I only included a piece of it for you to view. All power levels can be viewed in the next table. Power levels and criteria are ranked 1 - 5, with 1 being terrible and 5 being amazing.




Power Criteria | Weight | Qui-Gon Jinn | Obi-Wan Kenobi | Anakin Skywalker | Quinlan Vos | Yoda
--------------|------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|----
Wisdom | 25% | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 5
Combat Ability | 25% | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5
Leadership | 25% | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5
Lightsaber Awesomeness | 25% | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4
Weighted Average Score | 100% | 4 | 4.25 | 4 | 3.5 | 4.75

___

##Table 2: Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows both hair length and power levels (in descending order). Hair falls under this definition: ""any of the fine threadlike strands growing from the skin of humans, mammals, and some other animals."" Any Jedi of a species that looks like they have hair (such as Ahsoka Tano), but doesn't fall under the definition of hair, is classified as bald.

##Table 3: Correlation Between Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Hair Length|Average of Power Level|

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

___",Saved by the Gel: Examining How Jedi Hair Length Affects Their Power
StarWars,"VERY rough outline/idea. But I feel this would’ve been deeper and more substantive, add more to her character, and not feel like filler until the Mandalore arc.

After Ahsoka left the Order, she set off to find herself. She thinks she really needs to get as far away from the Jedi as possible, give herself space and time to think. After some time, she decides to go back to her homeworld of Shilli where she was born and where Master Plo found her. She finds her family, the one from which she was taken all those years ago, and we get to see how she and her family deal with their reunion. 

We get to see how taking force sensitive children affects families. Maybe, since Ahsoka was always on the frontlines with the poster boys of the Republic’s war effort (Anakin and Obi-Wan) despite being a child, we could see her families regret of giving her up and their resentment of the Jedi for taking her and “turning her into a child soldier, (along with their clone slaves).”

We really get to reckon with these parts of Jedi philosophy, and this builds up even more reason to believe the Jedi aren’t as great as they seem to be, all high &amp; mighty, taking children from families with little regard for how that can affect everyone. This gives more reason to believe the people of the galaxy would turn on the Jedi as we get closer to Episode III.

Eventually, despite loving her family, she gets tangled up with some crime that she traces back to Coruscant and decides she can’t live a normal life anymore. After everything she’s gone through, and everything she’s been taught, it’s too hard for her to let bad things happen knowing she has the power (more than most) to help stop those things... plus, maybe she misses action more than she thought she would.

So, she departs back to Coruscant. 

There, living in the lower levels, she really gets to see how bad things are even on the capital planet of the Republic! 

She sees how the distraction of the war has preoccupied the Jedi from taking care of things back home, and she sees just how deep corruption runs through Coruscant and the Republic as a whole, and how much of it stems from the Underworld. 

She decides to become a vigilante, working to take down crime syndicates and save innocent lives. She’s found who she is again, a peacekeeper and someone who fights for justice and for the little guy. This takes her into conflict with the Pyke Syndicate and other cartels. From there, she deduces their connection to Maul on Mandalore. She meets Bo Katan and agrees to help them take on Maul.

And that’s how we get to the Mandalore Arc.

We see how public opinion turns on the Jedi, we see how some families handle losing their children to the Jedi, we get more of the criminal underworld, and perhaps more importantly for Ahsoka as a character - We get to see Ahsoka deal with some awful tenants of the Jedi Order, which informs the rest of her life and leads to the confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader in which she so famously proclaims... “I’m no Jedi.”

Anyways, that’s just how I envisioned the continuation of her story. I still like parts of what we did end up getting, but it feels rather slow, pretty inconsequential/meaningless (especially since we’re really not gonna see Trace and Rafa ever and so much time was spent on them nonetheless), and not very deep or substantive for Ahsoka’s character.",An idea of what Ahsoka’s Season 7 arc could’ve been.
StarWars,"The Chosen One prophecy states that

&gt;""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.""

Many people see Anakin's act of killing Palpatine in ROTJ as the ultimate balance in the Force being restored. But Palpatine comes back in TROS and dies by Rey's hand, so that must make Rey the Chosen One, right? Not exactly.

For starters, **Rey cannot be the Chosen One because she had a father.** It doesn't matter whether you consider him a ""nobody"" like Kylo did in TLJ, we know he exists, we know he's a clone of Palpatine, we've seen him in flashbacks in TROS, so that already rules Rey out for this aspect of the prophecy. Luke is similarly ruled out - his father is, of course, Anakin. (Another case could be made that the prophecy specifies a male Chosen One, but that could really just be chalked up to gender-neutral language.)

So why do I still believe that Anakin is the Chosen One? The prophecy states that **""through [the Chosen One] will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.**"" Even if the final defeat of the Sith was in 35ABY in Exegol, 31 years after Anakin's death, can it not be said that ""through Anakin"", ultimate balance in the Force was restored? After all, almost all of Anakin's actions and decisions in the Prequel and Original Trilogies wind up directly impacting the Sequel Trilogy. In TLJ, Rey mentions Anakin's redemption to Luke and compares him to Ben; had Anakin not turned to the Light Side it's unlikely she would have been so convinced that Ben could be turned if he hadn't. (Also, Luke might've probably been dead, but you get my point.) Ben's entire motivation hinges upon trying to emulate his grandfather, and realising that he ultimately wasn't. Luke's failure between the Original and Sequel Trilogies stemmed fron his fear that Ben was going to become another Vader. This is why I get slightly annoyed when people say that the Sequels aren't about Anakin's legacy because Anakin never appeared as a Force Ghost - he may not have appeared, but his presence is deeply felt.

Furthermore, I've always taken the Skywalker Saga as a mythic tale (after all, Lucas based Luke off of Joseph Campbell's monomythic ""Hero of a Thousand Faces""). And one thing about prophecies in ancient mythology like Greek and Roman ones is that prophecies usually hinge upon wordplay and double-meanings, in that they usually never mean exactly what they say. Due to this, I'm far more inclined to take the ""through him"" aspect of the prophecy far less literally, and more in how Anakin's actions impacted his family and those around them in order to end the Sith.

In short, Anakin's actions basically set the stage for the complete and final destruction of the Sith in Exegol - Luke, Leia, Rey and Ben all being part of this aspect of the prophecy in how many of their actions and decisions were directly as a result of Anakin's deeds and his legacy. The way I see it, the Skywalker Saga (Episodes I-IX) basically tell the story of the Chosen One and the final defeat of the Sith, just that it took 67 years and 3 wars for it to finally end.

Of course, all of this is merely my interpretation of things. If you disagree, that's absolutely fine. Just try not to be an asshole about it.","I firmly believe that in spite of some recent comments, Anakin is still the Chosen One, and you CAN reconcile the Sequel Trilogy with this. Here's why:"
StarWars,"I don't watch Star Wars film to analyse plot details and expect an incredible Oscar-winning story, but at times there are certainly things that could have been done better. One issue I had with TRoS, is how at no real point was I ever expecting any of the main characters to bite the dust. The last film in saga is always going to have a happy ending and I knew this, but that moment when the entire cinema thought that Rey had just accidentally killed Chewie? Good lord I was honestly so shocked. But I did kind of feel cheated with the fake out.

To make the story of Rey's potential turn to the dark actually seem plausible, killing Chewie off here would have absolutely been a brilliant way to begin that subplot. They killed off Han in TFA, (probably should've killed off Leia in TLJ but that's another topic) so why not kill Chewie here? I love that Wookie but killing off another fan favourite like this would have been a seriously impressive move from the filmmakers for me.",Popular/Unpopular Opinion: Rey should have killed Chewbacca on Pasaana
StarWars,"Looking at the sequel trilogy now I feel the actors did a good job (Adam Driver is superb) and thought the cinematography and the visuals they created were excellent. However the story was utter horseshit. If the studio had the balls to let one director/writing team to see through a complete vision we would have 3 complete trilogies, not just 2. The EU before Mickey came along has so much great material to work with. Imagine a trilogy with Grand Admiral Thrawn as the main antagonist. Oh what could have been...",This is probably going to get downvoted to hell but I feel it’s worth saying...
StarWars,"I know the movie is considered one of the weakest ( than again I don’t know how you can say it’s worse than TLJ OR ROS)

I know the romance part was pretty cringe worthy and had awful dialogue. But I understood why Lucas wanted to have this as a focus.  It set the stage for Anakins downfall really well.  Showing him seeing visions of his mother dying and it turning out to be true and the Tuskegee raider slaughtering.  They needed to show how much Anakin loved padme so his turn to the dark side over saving her is more dramatic and he wasn’t just some desperate dude who falls in love quick .


Obi wans whole storyline and investigating the clone troopers was great.  Ewan’s Obi wan is the MVP in general of the prequels and I feel
This is where he really stood out was in this movie

The fight scene with Jango Fett and the scene before that where Obi wan is questioning him.  Just awesome.  Lucas was able to
Make a fight scene with a Jedi and a bounty hunter with no lightsaber incredibly entertaining .

Count dooku was great and his battle with Anakin and Obi wan was awesome 

I know we didn’t get a lot of it.  But when we see
The clone army appear and the battle on genosis was just epic.  Wish we saw more of that on the big screen .",Unpopular Opinion: I really enjoyed AOTC and it’s my favorite prequel movie
StarWars,"I started playing Battlefront 2 again recently because of all the praise it's been getting and how ""Dice totally improved it"" and ""it's a completely different game now"". I have to say I'm having a blast playing especially now I'm in self quarantine. For anyone that hasn't given it a shot I plead you to do so, Dice really deserves the money and support for making the game this dramatically better since launch.

However, one awesome thing I've noticed upon joining the Battlefront subreddit, following Insta pages and the devs Twitter accounts is how calm and collective everyone is. For comparison just take a look a subreddits like r/saltierthancrait or r/saltierthankrayt, both full of people circle-jerking over what they hate. Then there's the meme communities which are pretty tame as it's mostly just joking around but in the Battlefront community all you see is calm and honest discussion and showing appreciation for one another. I actually saw a prequel lover and a sequel lover discuss their differences and then ask for each others usernames to play, it's unreal sometimes.

So if you're torn on the content autistic screeching of most Star Wars communities I urge you to be a part of Battlefront, it's a breath of fresh air in a current world where opinions have right and wrong answers.",I think we can all agree that the Battlefront 2 community are probably the most civilised of all Star Wars fans
StarWars,"So I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning. 1977. And only today was I thinking about this:

Does Leia know that she's adopted? I mean IN the original trilogy when Luke tells her they are brother and sister... is she just realizing that she's adopted? It's not mentioned in any of the original films and obviously Lucas didn't have certain things in mind from the beginning. In A New Hope she's just the princess, in Empire there's the kiss between her and Luke so even then she wasn't intended to be his sister.

I say this because I have a theory that fixes the hole/contradiction when she mentions remembering her mother. People call it a flaw because of Padme dying at childbirth. And Luke saying, ""Your REAL mother..."" should give a person pause (like why did you just say ""real""?) but what if she didn't know she was adopted and her ""real"" mother, aka Bail Organa's wife, died when she was young? Maybe he remarried and she was talking about her birth mother? I assume part of keeping the Skywalkers hidded might include NOT telling them the truth.

I mean, Luke doesn't remember his mother so how and why would he ask Leia if she did if they're twins?

Am I missing something? I know there have been countless books and retcons but in 1983 that scene and dialogue is not problematic at all.",Leia theory/question from Return of the Jedi
StarWars,"I do like the idea of bio organic tech and a species that despises droids, and even intergalatic threats. What I don't care for is the extra galactic beings that have no imprint in the Force, something that doesn't seem like it would be restricted to one galaxy. The Ysalamiri are one thing, they evolved the ability to produce a bubble that negates the force to protect themselves from force sensitive predators, but the Yuuzhan Vong are 'absent' in the Force for no real reason. And basically all Force abilities don't effect them. Oh and the adding them into the past, like Canderous's experience. And spacers aren't tight lipped about strange experiences. That feels weird outside the unknown regions. They seem almost over powered...the force immunity is a big thing though...","This might be a controversial opinion, but I am glad that the Yuuzhan Vong are no longer canon."
StarWars,"So I was looking at the character art and bio's again and I don't know why I didn't realize this before or why I haven't seen anyone mention it. But with Vernestra being knighted when she is 16 that means she didn't spend all that long as a Padawan.

Most Jedi are taken as padawans when they are 12 with some being taken as early as eleven and thirteen being seen as being old (Obiwan was taken as a padawan when he was 13 and knighted at 23).

This means that if she was taken at the youngest age group of 11 to be trained by her master that would mean she was a padawan for 5 years.

Now this is being treated as something special and unique that happened to her. TCW mentioned how odd it was to make a teen a knight (you know when they tried to bribe Ahsoka with knighthood. Anakin was knighted at 19 and that was remarked as being unusually young) let alone one as young as Ahsoka. And we know from characters like Barris and Mayze Raynshi that they age like humans do so this isn't a baby yoda situation.

So I'm now even more interesting in what could have happened that would cause her to be put up for promotion to knighthood at such a young age and after so few years partnered with her master.",I just realized that the main character in High Republic: A Test of Courage has only been a padawan for at most five years before being knighted
StarWars,"If you had the chance to OK 3 projects for Disney/ Lucasfilm to start developing now, what would they be? I've got a few that come to mind instantly, and these are in descending order:  
1) A new miniseries from Tartakovsky that serves as a spiritual Ep X, focused on the aftermath of IX (Finn's force sensitivity, Zorii and Poe, Rey's next steps, Lando and Janna, New Republic politics, etc.)  
2) EA signing for a KOTOR Remake, done in a similar vain as Fallen Order but character creation  
3) A new movie set during the Prequel era with most of the original cast, but tangential to III's plot and more character focused.",My Unlikely Wishlist
StarWars,"So, as almost everyone I have decided that the best way to entertain myself during the quarantine is by undergoing a Star Wars marathon.

Today I was watching episode 2 after having watched the first yesterday, and I was wondering why the droid army in the first episode is under the control of the trade federation.

Isn’t it property of the separatists?

I know well that the separatists appear in the second but still I can’t quite grasp this whole matter.

I have come up with a couple of explanations and I would like to know what you think.

A) The droid army is an asset of the trade federation and it is dedicated to the separatist cause when the treaty on Geonosis is signed.

B) The droid army is in reality property of the sith and the trade federation is just helped by that very same army in occasion of the invasion of Naboo. In the first episode we can clearly see the Viceroy obeying to Dart Sidious.

A, B or something else?","I have a doubt, can you help me figure it out??"
StarWars,"So with the developments in the latest Clone Wars episode, is it possible that they could be bringing together Clone Wars, Rebels and The Mandalorian storylines? 

I don’t see anything in rules directly relating to spoilers for Clone Wars but I’ll be as vague as I can be in an attempt to not spoil it. If you are totally against any hints at all about CW’s latest ep then stop reading now. 

My theory is that the current CW episodes are foreshadowing some sort of story mechanism to tie into Mando in one way. That is yet tbd but I think we can see paths that could happen. Given that they’ve cast an adult Ahsoka for Mando, I could see Sabine and Ahsoka while looking for Ezra running into Mando in some capacity. 

I’m curious to hear others takes on this, if it’s been discussed already please point me towards that link. I have some loose details around it all, so I’d love to look through others takes on how it could all go down or how you’d like to see it happen.",Star Wars TV Series Fan Theory
StarWars,"Ok for English every Friday we would not do work a read a book of your choice and then at the end of the marking period we would have a project due on it. I picked A New Dawn for my book and now we are doing the project we were supposed to do it a few week ago but with everything that’s goin on it was pushed back. 

But anyways part of the project is we have to pick 3-5 themes that go on throughout the book and explain them. So far I have evil, and fate. Evil goes with out saying for the people who have read it. And fate because it’s like the conversation Kanan and Hera had in season for with they were meant to meet Ezra and be on lothal. In the beginning of the book Kanan and Hera had a few chances to meet but they didn’t, and even when the first time they meet and Hera chooses to just leave on the spot. It just happens to be the cantina she was meeting at was where kanan worked part time. It also connect to what qui gon said in the phantom menace “nothing happens by accident” he says something else but I can’t remember it. 

So I need two more or atleast one more theme. If anything has read the book thinks of one please let me know, I’m having a hard time coming up with more themes.","For anyone who has read a New Dawn, I need help."
StarWars,"I've just started watching the Star Wars saga and would love to get suggestions on the best watch order that I could follow. I came across the following list and was wondering if this is a good order:  


1. *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story*
2. *Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope*
3. *Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back*
4. *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones*
5. *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith*
6. *Solo: A Star Wars Story*
7. *Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi*
8. *Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens*
9. *Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi*
10. *Star Wars: Episode XI – The Rise of Skywalker*  


I've already watched Ep. IV and V",Watch Order
StarWars,"I've just watched episode 9, and the characters carried that film. It wasn't well written and a lot of the stuff was recycled through the whole trilogy. 

So I remember reading that Palpatine is Anakin's dad. He made his mother pregnant through the force. I don't know if that is true, but I thought it was interesting.

So if Palpatine is Rey's Grandfather, and Ben's great grandfather, and they decide to fall in some sort of messed up love. Star Wars lore is big on incest. That's worse than Luke with Leia when she ""didn't know.""",Lore (spoilers)
StarWars,"So I'm a fan of the machete order viewing of the original and prequel trilogies, and I don't want to debate that (here).  But during this quarantine, I really, really want to find things to share with my kids. I have 3 boys, though only the older 2 are in the discussion here.  6 and 4.5 years old.  What have fellow redditors done wrt sharing Star Wars with their kids? 

Second question, and the reason I brought in machete order... Phantom Menace might be the most kid friendly, and given it's place outside of the machete order, it could be a candidate for a standalone adventure with the kids for now?

Thanks!",Refreshing a surely old debate... at what age should I share Star Wars with my sons?
StarWars,"I'm thinking about making a Star Wars OC and am designing my own lightsaber for him. My question is how long can the blade of a lightsaber BLADE be? Throughout Legends and Canon we see countless examples of unique lightsabers. Some are short, some have three blades, some are more like daggers, some have unique shapes and sizes. I have seen a good number of these and am curious as to if it is possible to have a lightsaber blade that is longer than most? 
My idea is to have my character have a similar fighting style to that of Alucard in Castlevania. His sword is nearly seven feat long and he uses it like a rapier. 
Are their any examples of this in the lore? What would be the cause for a lightsaber such as this? Theoretically how long could one be?",How long can a lightsaber blade been be?
StarWars,"It is probably the series I read the most of my EU collection mostly because I love seeing the kids grow as characters. When Jacen accidentally removes Tenel's arm and they grow closer as friends and more...very well written and dealt with a lot of real emotion and trauma. Seeing him finally making her laugh was such a treat.

But nothing beats when they are trapt on Ryloth freezing to death. It was heart wrenching when they are laying there barely alive and she just whispers ""Tell me a joke.""...

It is a huge shame on how Jacen ends up later but nothing will remove my enjoyment of those young adult books no matter what my age.",How many of you have read the Young Jedi novels and who absolutely loved Jacen and Tenal Ka's relationship
StarWars,"Star Wars, is just levels beyond almost all other intellectual properties and fictional universes. It is one of the few worlds that almost feel real to me when I’m watching it. Star Wars is just, so awesome, I’m thankful all the time that George Lucas did what he did in 1977. A coworker of mine said she saw a new hope in theaters when it came out and that she and all of her friends were absolutely blown away. I told her that it still has that affect 40 years later. Star Wars, is just the perfect fictional world.",Can we all just acknowledge??
StarWars,"Going to get right into it, no time wasted on intros. 

**Episodes:** Both 1 and 8 are really really bad. I don't know how the bookends managed to be so poor in comparison to everything in between. The rest of the episodes are pretty good. I especially like episode 2 with the Sand Crawler and Jawas. Very cool, and was the episode that made me most feel like I was watching Star Wars. 

**Characters:** Mostly a win here. All of them are interesting and unique, except the forced in female badass that has to be everywhere now. She's an alright character, but you can tell they're trying waaaay too hard to make her this total badass with her laser mini gun! Pretty poor acting chops too. Better as a MMA fighter. 

I absolutely LOVE that they got Pascal to play Mando. He was fantastic in Prospect as well.

The lead antagonist is horribly miscast, Moff Gideon. I keep expecting him to walk off set and come back with a bucket of chicken. He's just not opposing or intimidating at all and feels like he's phoning in his role. His cool, calm demeanor works wonders in Breaking Bad, where he's this huge kingpin hiding a drug empire through chicken restaurants, but Star Wars villains need to be a bit more threatening and have some gravitas to them. Gideon feels like he has all the gravitas of a 3 piece meal. 

**Music/Score:** Total garbage. The main theme grows on you a bit, Mandos, but everything else barely passes as placeholder. The whole western motif trying to be Star Wars is pretty lame and is definitely sub par to anything John Williams has produced for the universe. It doesn't even come close. 

I wish they would actually use the original music and Williams's work. Whenever I see Baby Yoda pick something up, I want that slow creep of the horn to come in just like in the Wampa cave in episode 5. The Force Theme has no rival.

**Editing and Pacing:** Hit and miss here. The side dissolves and upwards wipes are there lol, but the show feels like a Netflix production forced into the Star Wars universe. I can't really describe it. Some of it is fantastic, but it just doesn't flow as well as it should. A lot of the directing is setting up mediocre tropes  that worked well when Avengers came out in 2012, but is pretty predictable and unimaginative at this point in 2020. It's familiar and definitely not as exciting. 

**Sets/Costumes/Props:** Have to give it to them here. Everything is working as intended and everything from the backdrops to the actual gadgets the main characters use are awesome. 

My only critique here is that you can tell some of the sets are small on purpose to save on costs. I think with a bit more funding they could have eliminated this vibe, but many scenes are shot very tightly and you can tell the scene only exists inside the camera lens. It feels like if you were to look further, the scene would cease to exist and you'd see extra's, stage hands and material lying around, which pulls you out of the world a bit. 

**Script/Story:** A solid B. WAAAAAY better than the prequels scripts, I'll give the show that. The Fav can outwrite Lucas and it mostly works. There are a few cringe moments ""This is the way!"" and some lines that don't seem as genuine as they should, but this is mostly due to the acting. The underlying story is also very interesting and works well with the dynamic between Mando and Baby. 

Just my thoughts on the show. 

Yours?","Mandalorian falls short of Star Wars, but is decent entertainment"
StarWars,"Why did the Mandalorian change his mind about taking Yoda? He said in Episode 4 that a kid travelling in a ship...something...is no life for a kid...something like that, but we see Yoda in the Razor Crest at the beginning of Episode 5....so he changed his mind? 

And then there was no explanation as to why they were being chased...as I was watching I was guessing...okay, are we going to have a ‘24 hours before’ to explain why they’re being chased? Nope. I suppose the only plausible explanation is because the pilot was hunting down Yoda 🤷🏼‍♂️. But no clarification. 

And the ending....hmm! I reckon the mysterious cape possibly belongs to Giancarlo’s Moff Gideon character because he has a cape, he’s a villain and the sniper girl was also a villain so perhaps they were allies 🤷🏼‍♂️",The Mandalorian Episode 5
StarWars,"1) The Last Jedi.... Think about that title. Luke was a confirmed Jedi, so the title has to be referring to him. For him to be the last, it means there was no other and wouldn't be another. Further, the sacred Jedi Texts were done away with formally and officially. Literally this movie is all about how the Jedi are no more.
2) She could use force lightning, no Light-side Jedi ever could and it's usually considered a dark side power. 
3) The obvious: she's a Palpatine 
4) She wouldn't have been a sith, of course, since she didn't succumb to the dark side - a grey Jedi M.O is to be able to dabble a bit with the dark side of the force but not fall into it.",Discuss: do you guys think Rey could be considered a Grey Jedi?

I really don't know what it is either. Effects are outstanding for the time, some very memorable scenes but I find it lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. Something that's missing which allows me to get a lot of enjoyment from a lot of the other movies. 

I'll say again that it is a great movie from a technical standpoint and I don't have a major complaint but I just don't find it entertaining. Your thoughts?",A Potentially Controversial Opinion
StarWars,"Obviously, Star Wars is known for its memorable villains, all of whom are (usually) Sith or Dark Side users. But after rewatching the prequels, I got thinking: what would it be like if there was a Star Wars movie where the antagonist is a Jedi?

As many have noted, the prequels explore the failures and hypocrisies of the Jedi, and how the very order is in part, responsible for its own downfall. I think it’d be interesting to see a movie where this exploration is continued via a Jedi antagonist. Maybe this particular character believes in the Jedi code, but is an extremist; to them, anybody who doesn’t support the Jedi or the Republic is instantly enemy. Maybe they’re obsessed with the light side, and in an effort to purify the Force, seek to destroy all remnants of the Dark side throughout the galaxy. Obviously, this could cause some conflict due to their violent rampage, thus leading to a story where said character is an antagonist.

Maybe this seems like a stretch, but personally, after seeing the ST simply mimic the OT in almost every way, I can’t help but wonder about the numerous original possibilities the films could’ve taken. All in all, I’d love to hear what you all think.",How would you feel about a Star Wars film where the antagonist is a Jedi?
StarWars,"Imagine if the entire mythology of the Sith for the past 1000 was based on a cruel lie - and that Darth Bane actually survived in the bodies of his apprentices for 1000 years through transference.

What if Bane manipulated apprentices to ""kill"" him in an act of gaining the dark side mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for themselves but which would actually be a dark side ritual Bane would use to inhabit their bodies? This would have made for an incredible twist in ST, that Palpatine wasn't even himself but actually a very ancient Sith Lord who had shown incredible patience and cleverness in order to take down his ancient enemy: the Jedi Order.

It would also keep to the prophecy to in that Darth Vader, redeemed by his son, destroyed Bane / Palpatine in an act of love for his son, not in an effort to seek more power and overthrow him.

Also: Could you imagine the prequel content for such a character and his engineering the destruction of the Sith of his time so he could control/manipulate one individual at a time until he was able to achieve his goal 1000 years later?",Would it not have made sense to make the villain of the ST Darth Bane?
StarWars,"Now that the dust has finally settled and everyone has had time to claim down about the sequel trilogy,I would to ask everyone a question.As you all know when the prequels started coming out the fans hated them,The backlash from fans was insane people started Attacking the actors and George Lucas for quote “ruining there childhood”,But eventually the generation that grew up with the prequels started to praise the films once they finally had a voice. However now I can’t help but feel a strange since of deja vu with history pretty much repeating it self ,but instead of people be angry at George their mad at Disney. So my question how do think future generations will the sequels once they’re old enough to have a voice.",What will future generations think of the sequels?
StarWars,"So I’ve been a big fan of Star Wars for the longest time and probably know just as much history and lore about it as I know actual history. My father was a big fan when he saw the original trilogy and the prequels. He’s also watched the newer movies too, but since we’re on quarantine, we want to catch up on everything but he’s still out most of the day for work and doesn’t have much time to catch up on the clone wars, so I’m asking if anyone has a list of the main important lore of the show, I’ve already watched the whole show myself, I just don’t know where to start for him to see. And I’m wondering if anyone knows where I can find Fallen order in the form of a movie, cause he doesn’t really like/understand how to play modern games so I rather we just watch some sort of cutscene edit of the game. And I’ve failed to find something of that sort. Thank you",Important lore

Power in the Star Wars universe has been the subject of debate between fans for decades. ""Well, Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber, so he is obviously more powerful than Obi-Wan Kenobi!"" ""Yoda is the best Force user in the galaxy, he would destroy anyone else!"" Now, I present to you a fresh perspective: how Jedi hair length affects their power. Does being bald make you a better Jedi? Or having long, beautiful locks? Read on to find out.

___

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell). If I missed a couple, I apologize, please don't burn me at the stake.

**Methodology:**

There are two main data points used in this analysis: 1) hair length and 2) power level. Hair length is easy to break down: bald, short, medium, and long lengths of hair. Power level is a little more complex. It is a weighted average score based on four factors: 1) wisdom, 2) combat ability, 3) leadership, and 4) lightsaber awesomeness. Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.

##Table 2: Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows both hair length and power levels (in descending order). Hair falls under this definition: ""any of the fine threadlike strands growing from the skin of humans, mammals, and some other animals."" Any Jedi of a species that looks like they have hair (such as Ahsoka Tano), but doesn't fall under the definition of hair, is classified as bald.

##Table 3: Correlation Between Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Short|3.47|
|Medium|3.39|
|Long|3.52|

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

StarWars,"I'm 32, born in 1988, when I was young I had a little tiny X-Wing figurine, but it wasn't the kind in the movies. It had the same engine configuration as the t70 now uses. My memory is really vague, but I thought it was a prototype that came before the t65, or it was a scrapped design that George Lucas came up with, outside of the Star wars universe.

I'm just wondering if anyone knows more about that old Toya had? is my recollection correct? Or maybe I got it wrong and it was a figurine of the 270 that came after? Did they use it in the novels and stuff that they scrapped when they made episode 7?",T70 reuses old design?
StarWars,"I’ve seen a lot of stuff online about people trying to figure out where in its development the Child from the Mandalorian is, based on the age given and comparing it to how old Yoda was when he died. Some people think that the species has a proportional lifespan, some people think maybe they mature fast, and some have even tried to convert “Yoda years” to standard years. 

To all that, I say: What if the Client just got the age wrong? He didn’t have a complete chain code in the first place, is it really a stretch to think that he got it wrong and the Child is really only 10 or something like that? I think it’s a much easier explanation than all this complicated guesswork. What do you guys think?",[Spoiler] Has anyone considered the idea that maybe they got the Child’s age wrong?
StarWars,"Hear me out: Kree are an elite police force that eschew emotion to become great warriors (Jedi). The Skrull are Sith. They appear evil, although they are not, and they are nearly undetectable by the Kree. The movie chronicles a Jedi knight (Carol Danvers) who learns to use her emotions (the Dark Side) to make her more powerful. Mar-Vell was a Jedi Master who studied a Sith holocron and was turned, and her padawan journeys to recover it and help the Sith create their new empire. Other random pieces of the puzzle: 

• Kree Central Intelligence is the amalgam of all knowledge and experience, aka the Jedi Council. 
• A couple Kree/Jedi use weapons that imitate either the Force or lightsabers
• Carol Danvers’ story parallels Anakin’s: she’s a pilot, who is taken from her friends and family to become a warrior. She eventually and voluntarily leaves behind both personas behind to master her emotions and become the most powerful one of them all.",Captain Marvel is a Sith propaganda film
StarWars,"I noticed it when rewatching the movie today and I never saw anyone else mention it. In both first and last scene with Vader, he looks out of the window on his Star Destroyer: in first, looking at his fleet in search for the rebels, in last, looking at the Falcon escaping. 

I think that they are way too similiar to each other for it to be a coincidence. I think it might show that after the whole chase after rebels, Falcon and Luke, he ended where he started, without achieving what he wanted(capturing Luke)(tho he did still destroy the rebel base on Hoth, however they did escape).

Any other theories on what it might be? Or maybe it is just a massive coincidence.",Vader's first and last scene in Empire Strikes Back are identical.
StarWars,"Han Solo is frozen in a rectangular prism, but his face, hands, front torso, etc. stick out of the carbonite bar. Most of the surface is flat, but the frozen man protrudes from the otherwise completely flat surface. Am I wrong to assume carbonite is frozen in a rectangular mold, and why does Han disrupt the barrier? With his hands out, it always looked to me like he was smushed by something like a wall in front of him, so does that have anything to do with it? How did the rest of the surface stay flat, molded, if he stuck out the front? Might be a dumb question, but if anyone knows the mechanics of this better than me, shed some light! Thanks! :)",Question about Carbonite Blocks

StarWars,"1. Education - Training

The Jedi always strive to self improve in the three areas of body, mind and The Force.


1.a. Training of the body

The Jedi practices physical fitness and, more generally, the abilities of their body.The Jedi extends their knowledge of the human body. A Jedi with physical limitations shall focus their studies in the areas that are possible for them.


1.b. Training of the mind

The Jedi is mindful and uses the moment.

The Jedi practices meditation.

The Jedi gains clear insight into things.


1.c. Training in The Force

Everything that exists is energy. The Jedi serves as a resonance vessel of power and acts in harmony with the world. The Jedi practices understanding of their senses and surroundings.


2. Discipline

The Jedi realizes that self-respect and self-control
are the fruits of discipline through care, patience and diligence. Decide seriously and consciously for the path of the Jedi.

Correct speaking:

The Jedi speaks true to their conscience and the way of the Jedi. 

Correct behavior:

The Jedi acts true to their conscience and the way of the Jedi. 

Correct appeal:

The Jedi's division of life should not conflict with the training and the path of the Jedi.

Correct effort:

The Jedi's training should progress at a reasonable speed.


3. Conscious mindfulness

The Jedi carefully uses the means of self-reflection,
to become aware of their motives, actions and reactions
and how it affects their environment. 
A Jedi should always be aware of the cause and effect.

The Jedi pays attention to their thoughts,
because they become their words.
The Jedi pays attention to their words,
because they become their actions.
The Jedi pays attention to their actions,
because they become their habits.
The Jedi pays attention to their habits,
because they shape their mind.
The Jedi pays attention to their mind,
because the mind shapes their fate.


4. Overcome fears

A feeling like fear can be a good teacher, but it is an absolutely terrible master.
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hatred and hatred leads to unspeakable despair and suffering.


5. Overcome the buildup

The Jedi separate themselves from everything insignificant. 
What is important is not acquiring more burden, but letting go of them. 
The Jedi lets go of greed, hatred, delusion and all illusions.
When the Jedi understands that there is no self, they let go to form a unity with everything else, letting go is the way to true freedom. The Jedi lets go, the unreasonable sensual attachment.
No abuse of intoxicating or addictive substances.
A Jedi is not overwhelmed by feelings, but uses them consciously and sensibly instead.


6. Forgiveness

The Jedi lets the past go, but doesn't deny it either. Healing will be experienced by looking at the present and future life, no longer dictated by past pain or resentment.
The Jedi forgive others and themselves, without denying guilt. 


7. Humility

The Jedi is friendly, humble, mannered and selfless.
Gratitude is an essential element on the path to humility.


8. Sincerity

The Jedi is honest, responsible and reliable.
They do not abuse the trust that is placed in them and - if necessary - remain silent.
These are the first steps on the path of loyalty and honor.


9. Compassion

The Jedi is considerate, empathetic, and understanding
and thus reaches true kindness.


10. Willingness to help

The Jedi help to the best of their abilities.
If possible and necessary, the Jedi alleviates the suffering of others. The Jedi does not harm anyone, unless to prevent greater harm to others and never without thought, consideration and hesitation. 


11. Bravery

The Jedi knows that bravery requires self-confidence, courage and determination. The Jedi is a keeper of peace, but when necessary, they are protectors of the weak and helpless. This is the civil courage that distinguishes a Jedi.


12. Knowledge

The Jedi realizes that every circumstance depends on conditions. They do not try to enforce things, if the circumstances do not comply. Because only if the conditions are right, everything can fit together harmoniously. 

The Jedi realizes that everything is limited and nothing is of eternal existence, everything is subject to change.
In their inner harmony, the Jedi no longer differentiate between friend, enemy or stranger, but instead recognize beings as they actually are. For Jedi, the pathway to the goal is part of goal itself.

Should there be any more questions to the philosophy of the Jedi and Jediism, you can message me in the dms or leave a comment on this post. Jediism is not a joke, so I ask for serious questions and commentary only.","Learn about Jediism!

It even is officially registered in Australia, Texas or the UK. The Jedi Code is in the description:"
StarWars,"I'd love to hear your stories!

For me, I'd say that moment for me is when Rey lifts the rocks on crait and saves the Resistance to fight another day. Let me explain.

When I was growing up, I was the target market for the prequels. I've loved Star Wars my entire life and have countless great memories thanks to George's creation. I had so much to play with in this big universe. Whether I was playing video games like Jedi Power Battles or the pandemic Battlefront games, fighting with my friends over who got to be Anakin or Darth Maul in our plastic lightsaber fights, opening my 3rd version of Obi-Wan's action figure, or going with my dad and my three best buddies to watch Revenge of the Sith in theaters for my birthday, there was always new ways to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe. 

The only problem was I could never get my little sister to love it as much as me. Sure, she would help me through the Mustafar level on Lego Star Wars and have some fun doing it, but even to this day as a young woman in college, she couldn't care less about Star Wars. The sequel trilogy has made me very aware of how hard it used to be for girls to insert themselves into Star Wars. That makes me sad because I feel like they're missing out. Carrie Fisher, Natalie Portman, and Ashley Eckstein's contributions should never be overlooked, but you can't argue with the positive impact that Rey being the main protagonist/hero in the sequels has had on female interest levels in the galaxy far far away.

That's why the lifting rocks moment in TLJ means so much to me. That was really the moment that cemented Rey as the main heroine and badass Jedi of the sequel trilogy in my opinion. The thought that a whole new demographic of people are taking their first steps into the larger world of Star Wars because they look up to Rey the same way that I looked up to Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi as a kid excites me and brings me more joy than anything else.","What's a Small Star Wars Moment that Probably Doesn't Mean Anything to Most People, but Means Everything to You?"
StarWars,"So, I was thinking about the Ghost while watching Episode 7 just now.   


Who is flying the Ghost in Episode 9? Would it really make sense for it to be Hera? I think it would have to, at the least, be her son, at this point. Considering that Hera was an adult during Rebels, and the ST takes place 34 years after Return, Hera would, at the least, be well into her 50's. Not out of the realm of still being a pilot, but her son would probably have taken over, wouldn't he? Or do you think she'd still be piloting with her son as co-pilot?",General Syndulla?
StarWars,"What you’re seeing now is exactly what you’d expect if they were.     

First, we know the powers that be are paying attention to fan demands. Thus the massive retcons in TRoS.     

They have certainly heard about the demand for the JJ version (if it exists). At the least, they know there is strong demand for an extended version.     

If they wanted to release one, they would of course aim to make as much money as possible.     

They would release the theatrical version first.    

To maximize demand for an extended version, they would leave deleted scenes off this release, just as Lord of the Rings did.    

They would make zero mention of an extended version coming later, because as soon as they did, sales for the theatrical version would dry up. So they would stay silent about it. But subtle tips from actors about all the amazing extra scenes that were filmed would be a perfect way to build demand. Likewise, hints from art books of deleted content only serves to make fans salivate for an extended version all the more.      

Then, around the next big buying season (say, Christmas 2020), they’d released the extended version as the perfect gift idea for Star Wars fans.    

This path guarantees the most cash income for Disney, as many fans would end up owning both versions.    

Now of course we can’t read Disney’s minds. But it is interesting that the path we’re on looks exactly like what you’d expect it an extended release was in the works.","I’m not saying it’s guaranteed that they’ll released an extended version of The Rise of Skywalker, BUT—"

**Sample Size:**

The pool of Jedi I conducted this analysis on are all canonical Jedi from Episodes I - IX. This includes Clone Wars and Rebels. There is a total count of 53 Jedi, ranging from Anakin Skywalker to Barriss Offee. I have also included Jedi who turned to the Dark Side (examples: Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, Pong Krell).

##Table 3: Correlation Between Hair Length and Power Level

This table shows the average power level correlated to each length of hair.

|Hair Length|Average of Power Level|
:--|--:|
|Bald|3.11|
|Short|3.47|
|Medium|3.39|
|Long|3.52|

___

**Conclusion**

Based on the data above, the general trend demonstrates that, on average, **the longer the hair, the more powerful the Jedi**. Yes, Mace Windu is one of the most powerful Jedi, but his group is being dragged down by a large amount of average and below-average Jedi. I hope this analysis helped answer all the questions out there regarding a Jedi and his hair.

StarWars,"So here's a brief context. 

I was exposed to star wars from a young age due to some toys passed down to me from my mum/her siblings. Basically it was some plastic coins/disks collectible thing with the names of films/hologram of a character etc (not sure what they're called, if someone knows what I'm talking about itd be great). 

Anyway that's how I came to know of star wars. Then i was watching TV and came across a Star Wars film or show (this was like early 2000s when I was like 5) and I remember seeing Darth Vader (and getting nightmares about him).

I would see star wars toys in shops such as Argos but I never pursued it, although telling my self that I need to watch it some day.

5 years ago, I came across star wars rebels and fell in love with it. This re-sparked my interest in Star Wars and I basically read so much about it on the Wiki that I almost knew everything that was canon, despite only having watched the first 3/4 Rebels seasons.  

By this time I was pretty fascinated with Vader and felt sorry for Anakin.

I forgot about it, got a bit bored of it until this lockdown ensued. I was bored and didn't know what to watch so I decided to finish of Rebels. That again sparked my interest in star wars and I refreshed my knowledge and began watch first the Original trilogy and then the Prequel trilogy. 

Although there was no need as I already knew lot of star wars lore, I felt I could not truly be a star Wars fan until I watched the original six films.

I am proud to say that Ive finally finished Rebels and the original Six films. Rebels was always my favourite Star Wars media, and I'm looking forward to seeing the Ghost's crew again. Meanwhile, I will be watching the Mandalorian and then maybe the sequel trilogy.

Sorry for the terrible writing as I'm on mobile and can't be bothered to correct any mistakes.",I finally finished watching the original 6 films!
StarWars,"In my Star Wars fanfic - the Star Wars: Reverse, **this** is how Rey is like.

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this.

Rey is a boyish loner and doesn't likes romance. She got her friend Ben in a friend zone, but later, was too proud to accept that she felt in love with him.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

Rey had a breakdown when realised what Dark Side truly is, when she tried to kill Leia, who just wanted to calm her down.

*Rey's is a mirror image of Anakin, but now, the Jedi can really help her. Rey is now more complex.*

**Rey is just a teenage girl, who doesn't actually know what she wants.**

StarWars,"So I just started watching Rebels recently, and am still pretty early in the seasons. There was a line that Sabine says during a battle when she's docking with Ghost: ""I'm in the pocket, 5 by 1."" There is a similar line from the movie Aliens that the combat pilot says on their approach to the world: ""We're in the pipe, 5 by 5."" I know that the Aliens line us fairly common and means that they are flying true and on target but have never heard the '5 by 1' before. I assumed it was a nod to Aliens but maybe I just watch too much sci-fi. Any thoughts?",Aliens reference?
StarWars,"I'm going to start this off with saying that Solo is genuinely my favorite Star Wars movie. I'm a big fan of the series and I love every movie in the saga quite a bit. It makes me kind of sad that the fan base (or at least from what I've seen) doesn't really talk about it that much.  I saw it when it first came out in theaters and was shocked to find it didn't do well financially. I absolutely love Solo and I think a lot of people sleep on it for various reasons. I wanted to get my thoughts out in a post and talk about why I like it so much.

* All of the actors do a great job portraying their characters

I really enjoy Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo and think he did a great job portraying what a young han looks like. For me he really captured the essence and roguish charm of Han. Let's face it, playing Ford's Solo from the original trilogy gave Ehrenreich some really large shoes to fill but in my opinion he perfectly nailed it. The same could be said for Glover's Lando Calrissian, he did a great job playing an inexperienced and confident young version of the character, and I found Glover's and Ehrenreichs chemistry to be great, they played off each other very well.  Woody Harrelson as Becket and and Emilia Clark as Qi'ra provided really enjoyable supporting roles as well.

* The action sequences are phenomenal

From the train heist to the Kessel run, Solo is really fun to watch and some of the sequences are amazingly executed. My personal favorites are the Corellia chase scene and the final showdown between Han and Becket.

* It has a ton of charm and has a really satisfying ending

There are very few moments in Star Wars that I enjoy more than Han failing badly at bluffing the thermal detonator in the Lady Proxima scene. The gambling scenes between Han and Lando are amazing as they constantly try to one-up one another.Does Solo hit all of the marks you would expect? Yes, We get the Kessel run, Han wins the Falcon from Lando, Han meets Chewie, etc. However, I really like how it hits those marks, to me it doesn't feel forced and somehow they managed to weave it all into a fun space-western style story.  I really like how Han was developed as well; at the start of the movie he's a naive kid scraping to survive with aspirations of adventure and becoming a pilot. He's not the Han we know from a new hope, a hardened, experienced, and sarcastic smuggler. We do, however, see the frame work of the Han we all know and love, although unwilling to admit it, Han is a rogue with a heart of gold and it shows during Solo. Qi'ra does a great job helping emphasize that aspect of his character and even points out as much point blank in the movie. Becket serves as a great foil to Han, showing him how he may eventually become: jaded and willing to betray others at a drop of a hat.

Solo is a personal favorite of mine and wanted to know your thoughts on it. There's a lot I didn't touch on here like the great soundtrack, costume design, and interesting locations because this already got pretty rambley but I wanted to get my thoughts out there.",Let's talk about Solo
StarWars,"The Force is probably the greatest fictional “magic systems”. But the biggest problems with it is how many different interpretations people can have about it. I decided to just share my interpretation of the Force. For fun.

Firstly I look towards George Lucas as a person and what beliefs he holds. Because this undoubtedly influenced how he created the force. From what we know George is a Christian and lived during the Free love movement. Along with an apparent curiosity of eastern religions. So I built my interpretation around these ideas.

In my Interpretation the Force is not only alive but life manifested. The force represents fate/destiny and can influence events to meet “its will” which I believe could mean the collective desires of the galaxy. Hence why The First Order, Empire and Sepretists were able to gain such power. Because people were desiring what these factions could bring and so the force moved the pieces to make it happen.

The Father, Brother and Sister along with the wills are not true beings but just manifestations of the force that allow it to rely its will directly.

I also believe that there can never be balance in the force. The dark side and light cannot exist in peace. Because the dark side is not a natural part of the Force, but a corruption of it. It is like an addiction. Like ICE or the incredibly addictive drugs, you can rehabilitate from it but you cannot use it repeatedly without getting addicted. 

Also I believe the force is in everyone, all people need is faith. not belief, faith. I also hate the idea of power in the force. The force belongs to everyone so everyone is just as strong in it, it is merely Understanding, Faith and the will of the force that decides ones strength. Atleast for the light side.

These are just some of my ideas about the force, what do you think the Force is.",My Interpretation of the Force
StarWars,"Lucas's view of the Force, as I understand it, is basically that there is no Dark-Light dichotomy. The ""Light side"" is just the Force in it's ""natural"" state. The Jedi believed Force-adepts should strive for a peaceful, natural, almost symbiotic relationship with the Force. The Dark side is a general term for people trying to bend the Force too closely to their will, particularly for selfish or ignoble purposes, and the abilities that manifest as a result of that. That's supposedly why ""balance"" means ""a lack of Darkness,"" because Darkness is essentially just human (or alien?) depravity and megalomania twisting the Force into something unnatural. (If this is wrong let me know!)

If this is true, how can the cave on Dagobah be, as Yoda describes in RotJ, ""strong with the Dark side of the Force""? If it's a natural formation, shouldn't it be neutral in the Force if anything? How can something inanimate by Dark-sided if Dark-sidedness comes from selfishness and megalomania?","According to George Lucas's original conception of the Force, how/why does the Dark side cave on Dagobah exist?"
StarWars,"So I was thinking about the sequels, and how I would’ve liked to see them done, and I had an idea for how I would’ve done the sequel trilogy if I was in charge of making the canon for Disney. 

This post is a lore/set up post to the first movie of the trilogy, if you guys like it and want more I’ll write out the whole trilogy. 

This trilogy would be proceeded by an age without sith. The republic would be back, all shiny and new, but closer look would show that many systems are refusing to join the republic, making it unstable and weak. Also that good old corruption and snails pace bureaucracy is still very much alive.

The Jedi are back, with a nice shiny new temple built on....not Coruscant. Why? Because 20ish years of imperial propaganda mixed with the knowledge that Vader was once a Jedi wasn’t great for public relations. Many in the republic senate, with a few more *convinced* by Remnant spies, felt the Jedi should be banished to the outer rim, but Leia, and Luke’s reputation, convinced the senate to allow the Jedi to set up in the mid rim. 

Luke has done a pretty good job with the Jedi order. It doesn’t have a lot of strictness of the old order, and many Jedi don’t carry light sabers. The order does have a small Knight caste, but with the lack of sith and the fact that no one wanted their help most Jedi don’t carry their sabers. Leia and Han’s son is in that caste. 

Earlier I mentioned the remnant, that’s what’s left of the empire. After Endor the empire was on its last leg. They take lose after lose until they are beaten back to only a handful of systems. The imperials, their backs against a wall, bet everything on one last stand. 

After Endor the rebels had skyrocketed in numbers. Many people saw it as a chance to get rich, though some saw it as a sort of tryout for the republic military council. The republic never associated itself with the rebels, and poached their leadership, so when the remnant made its final stand the army it was facing was too large for its supply lines, with no organization. The attack is shattered, the rebels cease to exist and the republic opens diplomatic channels with the remnant. The remnant is even granted a seat in the senate during a galactic pandemic. 

Neither side is any position to fight a war, so accepting each others existence and working together wasn’t the worst idea, though remnant planners held the goal of restoring the empire. 

This had been a false golden age for the galaxy. The fear and violence of the Clone War and Imperial Era was over, but every was weak and isolated. It was a peace that would not last once the Immortal Sith put his plan into motion....",If I got to create the new canon for Disney: Episode 0: LORE

StarWars,"I've been doing a Star Wars Marathon the past couple days, and I'm currently on Rise of Skywalker. The thing is, I think I figured out the deal with Force Healing (in universe), and why no Jedi used it.

What if, Force Healing is a Dark Side power?

Think about it. If it is a Dark Side power, it would explain why no Jedi would use it, and why Palpatine and Rey do use it in Rise of Skywalker. It also ties in with the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise from Revenge of the Sith.

Palpatine tells Anakin that Darth Plagueis was so powerful and wise in the Force that he could influence it to create life. That he ""had such a knowledge of the Dark Side that he could keep the ones he cared about from dying."" He specifically tells Anakin that the Dark Side leads to abilities like this.

Obviously, Palpatine is a Dark Side user, and Star Wars shows that Force can be passed down genetically, for example, the Skywalkers. Since Rey is Palpatine's descendent, then it could be reasoned that Rey inherited Palpatine's power as well.

It's just an idea I had that seems to make sense.",Theory about Force Healing
StarWars,"I know it's not canon. I know it's legends. I know it contradicts Rebels. 

But hot diggity does it have a special place in my heart.

So in your opinion, where would you place TFU 1 if you considered the contradictions as just pre retconned material? One could argue the Rebels TV series focuses on minor rebel cells and TFU was the culmination of said cells, for example.

I don't know, I'm grasping at straws. I do a similar thing with Kyle Katarn and Dark Forces -- he just got one piece of the Death Star plans! ...Or a dummy plan, so in comes Rogue One!

I know, ultimately, it doesn't matter, but it's just a bit of fun!

I thought Cal may have kept blue as his saber color especially since he is depicted with having a blue saber while he was training; however, in promotional material for the game, Cal is depicted with an orange lightsaber so I'm completely lost.

StarWars,"So, anyway, in Legends canon, Boba Fett did indeed escape from the Sarlacc pit. However, in current canon, he is very much a Schroedinger's Cat. Here's my idea for bringing him back.

So, make a movie or Disney+ limited series set a few years after he escaped the Sarlacc pit. After going through that experience, he has PTSD and has retired to live a peaceful life on his father's home planet  of Mandalore.

But then, his old friend Cad Bane approaches him for the job of a lifetime, thus setting up a ""one last job"" kind of heist movie set in space.

As for an actor to play Boba Fett, we obviously can't bring back Temuera Morrison since he's too old and has gained weight. My ideal casting choice would be Karl Urban, since he's also from New Zealand. We can retcon Boba and say that he was his father's biological son, but he paid the Kaminoans to pretend he was a clone so the Republic wouldn't use him as leverage.

StarWars,"OT remakes won't happen anytime soon (that would be in bad taste for a variety of reasons). But they are financially inevitable in the long run (30-50 years from now), especially after the original films start to look more like museum exhibitions than contemporary entertainment.

So remakes will happen, but not for a very long time. However, in the short-run (under quarantine), it is fun to speculate about what they could do to improve on the original movies.

As good as the OT were there were serious flaws that permeated them.  A remake could fix the following problems:

* The CGI can portray Darth Vader as a massively powerful force user  (which, despite his considerable loss of power on Mustafar, he as the chosen one absolutely still is), which the OT couldn't quite do with its CGI limitations
* The CGI can do the same thing with Obi Wan, Luke, and Palpatine
* Dialogue can be massively improved (no more Leia calling Han ""laser brain"" or Luke quipping to Vader ""you'll find I'm full of surprises"")
* As good as McDiarmid was as an actor, the makeup for the Emperor/post-Mace duel Palpatine sucked, and make him look too cartooinshly evil. (Think of how much more effective Senator Palpatine was as a character than the cartoonish Emperor in RotJ.) He would be more impactful as a character if he looked like a ""kindly"" old man with something twisted to hide; i.e. like a slightly deformed and somewhat ""frail"" version of Senator Palpatine
* Relatedly, Palpatine's and Vader's (failed) attempt to win Luke to the Dark Side should be more subtle and built-up; of course Luke rejects the Dark side but it needs to be less obvious that he will do so than it is in OT
* I honestly like the Ewoks, and think cutting them would be a bridge too far in terms of altering the OT's story; but the filmmakers need to (somehow) make their military prowess/victory over the Stormtroopers more credible. Maybe make the human-rebel force bigger, and able to contend seriously (albeit in a losing effort) against the Stormtroopers, until the Ewoks turn up and swing the tide of battle. (This is more credible than them being the entirety of the rebel force on Endor.)
* RELATEDLY, have storm troopers shoot and not miss sometimes!

Am I missing any problems? The key is fixing these things and somehow managing to capture the majesty and energy that the original films have.",Problems an OT remake could fix
StarWars,"A quick fix to how this works is that it should be a reverse hyperspace tracking procedure. Stay with me for a bit here.

The enemies have hyperspace tracking and the gang tried to find and destroy the tracking technology but failed. Meanwhile Holdo and the rebels managed to find a signal that only appears during hyperspace that is basically the tracking technology signal linking their ship to enemy ship.

As a last resort Holdo (and/or whoever other important rebel) manages to program their ship to haphazardly follow the Hyperspace tracking signal back to its source but since the signal follows channels no one has heard of, any ship using these routes is guaranteed to blow up. The explosion is so erratic that the debris exists in both hyperspace and normal space and obliterates anything ahead of it namely the Enemy ships that were doing the tracking.

Therefore the Holdo maneuver is born. It's essentially an ability that only exists because the light speed tracking exists.  It can only happen when light speed tracking is used. It creates a balance in the way the warfare works as the enemy now risks being immediately obliterated  every time they choose to track the rebels so they have to weigh the advantages of knowing the rebel locations versus losing a few hundred men for it. The rebels have to set up a ""Kamikaze squad""/""suicide squad"" of people on the ready to intercept the enemy tracking and then light speed ram their asses. 


The clanky mechanics aren't even the important part. It's just sci-Fi. What's important is the power balance between sides during the warfare when such things as hyperspace tracking and light speed rams are invented. I think this fairly remedies such power balance issues.",A quick fix to the movies: The Holdo Maneuver
StarWars,"Let’s look at some of the major Star Wars stuff made after the Original trilogy: Prequel trilogy, Sequel trilogy, Clone Wars, Rebels, Rogue One, Solo, The Mandalorian, Jedi: Fallen Order, Battlefront, The Force Unleashed, Knights of the Old Republic...(And a couple of other gems like Republic Commandos...)    
    
ALL movies, series and video game on that list except Knights of the Old Republic has revolved around the ~60 year time period from Episode 1-9, and even the prequels and the sequels revolved around 4,5 and 6.    
    
I recognize it DOES makes financial sense to stick around 4,5 and 6, but there is a huge, beautiful Galaxy over millennia to explore.

But... When she got there, she saw nothing but corpses of dead masters and her dear friends. *Her second family*. 

Crushed Leia was saved by Bail Organa, who wanted to ask the Jedi for help, but got to the Temple late.

Luke successfully landed on Tatooine, and was greeted by his aunt and uncle.

StarWars,"Now this is just my personal opinion but I genuinely think that Star Wars has never been about good triumphing over evil. It’s always been about The Force as it’s own entity trying to balance itself out. The Jedi are always talking about “bringing balance to the force” but the only thing they ever try to do is wipe out The Dark Side and destroy the Sith. But you can’t have balance with only one side present. The Force is not just a tool of the Jedi and Sith to be used and manipulated, it’s an entity living in all things, it doesn’t care about Good or Evil, Jedi or Sith, Light or Dark, because there is no Light or Dark side of The Force, there’s just The Force. If you look at the progression of all three trilogies chronologically every time one side gets too powerful The Force sends someone to the opposite side to create balance until that side gets too powerful and it sends another to the previous side. The original prophecy was true and came true, Anakin Skywalker was the one chosen by The Force to bring about balance to the force, he brought balance by putting more of the dark side into the mix. Then the Dark Side got too powerful so The Force sent Luke Skywalker to put more Light Side into the mix. Now the Light Side is too powerful, here’s Kylo Ren, too much Dark Side, Rey Palpatine enters. The entire time both sides thought they were using The Force but in actuality The Force was using them. I think that’s also why balance has been brought to The Force by the big names, Skywalker and Palpatine, The Force is in tune with them and their bloodline more because it chose them to bring balance, you can’t send Cal Kestis or Darth Maul or Cere Junda or Asaj Ventress because as much as we’d love to all feel special and like anyone can save the day no matter how small that’s not the case, you don’t send a boy to do a mans job, you don’t send children to fight a war, you send the one with the best chance of winning, The Force wants balance, it needs balance, and it will get it regardless of how I, you, or anyone else feels about it. This doesn’t mean that you can’t help in your own way, Rose’s gesture probably sparked a rebel in that child she met in that barn which would definitely help the cause and ripple into peace throughout the galaxy but she’s not enough to bring balance herself, Poe, Holdo, Leia, even Luke once he’d served his purpose while important in their own right are not enough to bring back balance it had to be the polar opposite of Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo, son of Han and Leia, nephew of Luke Skywalker, grandson of Darth Vader himself, Champion of both sides, but rejecting them all, he was the embodiment of The Dark Side but conflicted, able to be swayed closer to balance than you’d believe at first glance, and so who better to balance him out than Rey, daughter of unknowns, Champion of no one, the embodiment of The Light Side but like her adversary unsure of her placement in all of this she could be turned if you could get to her, but wait, she’s not just some random nobody, she’s the granddaughter of Darth Sidious aka Emperor Palpatine, slayer of the Jedi Order, there’s more to her than meets the eye, she is the only one strong enough to take on The Dark Side, because she is The Light Side, it’s not even completely about her bringing balance to The Force, without Kylo there would be no Dark Side to fight leaving only imbalance it had to be a Skywalker and so it had to be a Palpatine. Think of it as the ones who threw The Force out of balance are the ones who had to put it back.


**Tl;dr:**The Force is its own entity that doesn’t care for or want good to triumph over evil, it simply wants balance and will do whatever it deems necessary to get it.",Star Wars isn’t about ‘Good Over Evil’ it’s about The Force and Balance
StarWars,"[Long]
Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.

Which leads to my current dilemma. I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.

I am completely torn on this because she Loves it and I kind of like it but I am a big ""Risk mitigation"" kind of person that wholeheartedly believes in controlling the controllables and being happy with results after that and so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.
Any help is appreciated.",Anakin Baby Name?
StarWars,"Hi I'm sorry if this is in the wrong place or violate any rules I missed.

Okay, so my husband is a huge starwars fan. I know he would really like me to be interested in it and honestly I wish I were more interested in it.. but I'm having such a hard time. I cant seem to really get into it. I love fantasy and space and  what I think the elements of starwars are but I feel like I missing something.. we've been watching the clone wars on Disney+ and that's been good, I've also watched the prequels, slowly getting to the original 3..

So I guess my question is, what got you into starwars?

For reference I'm absolutely obsessed with lord of the rings and the hobbit and I didn't grow up watching starwars..",I need help understanding.
StarWars,"It’s just so many cool concepts all rolled into one.

Look at the scene in RotJ where Vader dies. It’s a scene where a *telekinetic cyborg* and the son that saved him from evil meet for the first time face to face on an *artificial planet* the he built to *control the universe* with his corrupt master, moments before dying, ultimately choosing to end his tortured life by redeeming himself and helping to free the galaxy from tyranny. 

And that’s just one scene that doesn’t include the force, lightsabers, ancient history, spaceship battles, etc. let alone the way the music and imagery go together to add to the story. It’s just so frickin vast and I wish we had more over the top awesome and unique stuff like Star Wars.",Star Wars is so frickin cool
StarWars,"I would be surprised if she didn't show up on Kenobi (once that's up and running again).

The perfect entry would be her showing up post Vader fight from Rebels and having a ""Did you know?!"" confrontation with Obi-Wan. In fact, that should be the opening scene before having the two of them partner for a while through the series. 

To be honest, the previous idea/premise for Kenobi that it would be him watching the twins (or just Luke) growing up sounded boring as hell, in my opinion. There is nothing compelling  about the kids growing up and the thought of Obi-Wan just sitting back and watching like a nosy neighbor would be lame television.

StarWars,"I've noticed while rewatching ROTS that the s-foils of the Eta-2 starfighter open to different angles. During the Battle of Coruscant the s-foils are almost vertical, but still angle towards the cockpit. When Anakin flies to Mustafar the s-foils are bent further to mimic Vader's TIE Advanced X1. In the latest Battlefront game flying as an Eta-2 shows the s-foils as being completely vertical on the dorsal side, and angled on the ventral side.

Is there an in-universe explanation for the various configurations, or am I just overthinking it?",ETA-2 S-Foil Inconsistencies
StarWars,"So I came up with a different way to bring back Palpatine.

3 Disclaimers: 

1. I am not very well trained in the ways of SW canon. I am just going to be speaking on the films for this. 

2. If this idea has already been shared, I apologize. I did a search through the sub and couldn't find it.

3. This is not a theory of what actually happened in Ep. IX. It is basically a fanfiction of what I wish would've happened.

**The Main Issue**

So the main problem I have with Ep. 9 bringing back Palpatine is I find it disrespectful to the story of the first 6 films. Ep. I-VI are the story of Anakin Skywalker. His arc is completed when he destroys the sith, brings balance to the force, and restores peace to the galaxy. But according to Ep. 9, Anakin's entire life didn't destroy the sith, it just set back Palpatine a few years. I thought this really hurt the original story. However, I loved watching Palpatine in Ep. 9. So I thought of a different way to bring Palpatine back.

**In this version of the story:**  
Palpatine is dead. He's dead. Snoke, on the other hand, is an extremely powerful Sith Lord. Not Palpatine's creation. The things Snoke does in TLJ throne room scene (throwing Rey with just the wave of a finger) suggest that he could be more powerful than Palpatine. (This was really just technological differences, but I'm gonna go with it for the story.) Anyway, every trilogy has an apprentice betray their master. 

Prequels: Palpatine betrays Plagueis

Originals: Vader betrays Palpatine

Sequels: Kylo Ren betrays Snoke

Except in the version, the sequels get an original twist: Snoke is so powerful that he is able to foresee that Kylo betrays him. 

""I can never be betrayed. I cannot be beaten!"" -Man who was betrayed and beaten seconds later

So instead of talking out of his ass, Snoke actually has a plan here. With his physical body destroyed, Snoke needs to find a new vessel. He chooses, the corpse of Emperor Palpatine. So instead of Palpatine doing some random Sith stuff and transferring his consciousness to Exegol into some clone process nobody really understands, Snoke transfers his consciousness to the corpse of Palpatine in an Exegol Sith cemetery.

**How it plays out in Episode IX**

Kylo goes to Exegol just the same. He hears the voice of Snoke instead of Palpatine. He of course comes to kill Snoke, but Snoke offers him the Final Order and they get along. Snoke has the body and voice (Ian McDiarmid) of Emperor Palpatine, but he is still Snoke. He doesn't ever claim to be Palpatine. (He can still say some of the famous lines though, cause why not). Snoke also needs to explain to Kylo that his intense use of the dark side to transfer his consciousness has drained him (sorta like Luke or Ben's death), and that this is his last chance. This is so we know that when he dies this time, he's gone for good. (Unlike Ep. 9 giving us no explanation about how Palpatine won't come back again. I know there's one in the novelization, but it should've been somewhere in the film.)

So this is Snoke's entire plan: to fake his death, then lure Kylo to Exegol so he can raise the Final Order and conquer the galaxy. He uses the corpse of Palpatine to carry this out. And yes, Snoke can use force lightning in Palpatine's body.

**Why do I like this better?**

1. Palpatine is dead. He died in Episode VI like his should have. Anakin killed him. The way the canon has it, it seems as though Anakin's entire journey was for nothing. This way, Anakin's story has much more meaning.
2. Even though Palpatine is dead, we still get to see Ian as Palpatine again, which is awesome. I guess Ian would be credited as Snoke/Palpatine.
3. The whole Rey Palpatine thing is gone. Rey is back to being a nobody, which tells us that not everyone has to be from some powerful family to be a hero. I think a lot of us like this better.

So... how do you think Palpatine should've been handled? What should've been done with Snoke?",A (Possibly) Better Way to Bring Back Palpatine
StarWars,"Thinking back on episode viii, it's kinda functional as the conclusion to the saga?

Full disclosure- i hate tros. i think it's a hollow mess more concerned with undoing tlj than saying anything of value. but i still dont think its just my fanboyism for this movie talking. tlj kinda works as a finale, when interpreted through the lens of one character; luke.

The machete viewing order was designed to adapt the prequels into the story of Luke, having episodes II and III as a flashback after ESB. i think that you can do the same thing with the sequels, watching the first two and omitting TROS because TLJ is the conclusion for luke's character.

There are definitely problems- TLJ wasnt intended to be the finale and narratively, it leaves almost everything unresolved and open ended. This is helped by the messaging of the film *implying* an ending: rey reforms the Jedi and the first order are unable to maintain power because hope wont be extinguished yada yada yada. The issue is that, unless you omit TFA, you spend an entire movie following characters that you're going to handwave the arcs of in the next film. the only real defence i have is that i think TLJ is a better ending for Luke than RotJ, and a better ending for the ST characters than TROS offers. Kylo might be the exception here: his point of emotional turmoil at the end of TLJ isnt a phenomenal endpoint for the character, and his redemption is (imo) okay in IX, but in the case of Rey, Finn, and Poe, I think the arcs they get in their second outings are way better than what they get in IX.",The Last Jedi: The Last Movie
StarWars,"After the release of Episode 9 i wonder if I should post this but thanks tk corona lockdown screw it Im bored


I feel the latter is a more appropriate title of the final trilogy. It seems to do more to tear down the franchise then build it up. 

Episode 7 basically recton the entire OG trilogy and forced the story to repeat history all over again right from the start instead of introducing some new without ruining the franchise foundation

And but you respond “Hey episode 8 was different!” Yes.....But not a good different.

Episode 8 then retconed pretty much all plot threads left unanswered in episode 7 while also unceremoniously killing beloved old/ interesting new characters. Plus copying scenes and event similiar to the OG trilogy, just like episode 7 did. 

Sorry the chase/fuel deleption plot just for everything to fail and them to have a hoth/ walker like scene and force holo luke was dumb and boring.

Episode 9 Then retcon not only damn near everything from episode 8, but then the OG trilogy and Prequel trilogy as well by basically saying fuck the skywalkers and fuck the Chosen prophecy which has pretty much been a foundation of the franchise since the beginning.

It mad the chosen prophecy bullshit and the Skywalkers irrelevant. The trilogy as a whole is unoriginal and its lack of planning by disney is very very apparent.",Sequel Trilogy.....or.....Retcon Trilogy

Do you guys know of anywhere to find a photo dump of hi-res stills from the movies? And are there any shots you think would work well for this purpose?

StarWars,"I am rewatching the sequels to assess and view the trilogy as whole. Last night I rewatched episode 7 and largely my original view is unchanged but I maybe enjoy it slightly more. Overall I think its an ok/fine movie but my original criticisms remain. Is it basically a rehash of ANH, yea it is but I understand why they did it. It was a safe way to introduce the series after it had been dormant for 10 years. My biggest original criticism is I think Kylo Ren should have won the duel/ Rey just manages to escape. I think it made more sense logically for Kylo to win and I think it would have been more interesting for Rey as now she has a benchmark to overcome and we feel Kylo is more of a threat later on as Rey was unable to match him the first time. My other criticisms are just small nitpicks such as I think it was kinda stupid how Rey could use a Jedi mind trick but it doesn’t detract too much from the movie. Oh and the cinematography/lighting for Han and Kylos scene on the starkiller base, 11/10, fantastic. But how about you guys? Any opinions or thoughts change as you watched and rewatched 7? Anyone else agree Kylo should have won?",Rewatched episode 7
StarWars,"This is really for general discussion and I'm looking for what people think.  

Here's a few facts:

* Fett's Iconography goes hand in hand with the Star Wars brand
* Fett has been a fan favorite since his appearance in ESB
* He was a focus of popular storylines in the EU and The Clone Wars
* He is the design foundation for all Mandalorians
* They continue to release new toys and comic book media including fett
* They're keeping Boba Fett as a part of the Star Wars core and it's profitable to have him continue to be popular. 
* IMO they wouldn't create a TV show within the lifespan of Boba Fett about Mandalorians without including him.

StarWars,"I think Disney should do one last ""A Star Wars Story"" movie, mostly to cover some of the plot holes left in the sequel trilogy.

Imagine a movie similar to Rogue One, set a couple of years before Episode VII, about a group of Mercenaries on a mission. We could see (for example) the rise of the First Order happening in the background and they finding out that Palpatine has moved his consciousness in a clone body before dying during Return of the Jedi. 
Then, like in Rogue one, have some, of even all, of the protagonists killed by the hands of the Knights of Ren (or some Sith Eternals) which, from what I understood, according to the novelization of Rise of Skywalker were actually loyal to Palpatine all along. As the last scene, set some years later, we see Palpatine remotly controlling Snoke to send Kylo and some troopers to Tuanul, the village at the beginning of The Force Awakens.

I know that Disney will never do anything like that after Solo: a Star Wars Story but I'd love to see a movie like that.

StarWars,"I would write this, but I think it would be more fun to see how you guys think of this.

The idea is this: shortly following TPM, Palpatine reveals his true self to Anakin, and turns him into a spy for him within the Jedi Order. When Ashoka arrives, Anakin converts her, and they serve Darth Sidious rather than Master Yoda.

When Sidious brings up the Rule of 2, Anakin refers back to when there were 2 Sith, but an army of Sith Acolytes as well.

StarWars,"My friend is a sequel lover and a prequel hater. Yes, we've talked about it. No, he won't denounce his crimes.  When asked about Rogue One, he said the beginning is slow and up until the third act he was disinterested.  It's a common thread I find with sequel lovers to say that a movie is boring or slow when trying to explain why they don't like the prequels/Rogue One.  How is it slow? Even if you don't get the amazingly deep and engaging plot, there's enough action to distract even the most ""flashy pictures"" kind of audience member. (One who only watches for the cool action or cgi and is otherwise disinterested in plot/cinematography/writing quality)  Rogue One is by far the best new age Star Wars movie ever to come.  Why? Because it honors the original work. Garreth Edwards didn't try to create a whole new Universe, like Rian Johnson says ""the rules of a Universe don't matter"".  Imagine if someone took Stan Lee's Marvel, and all of a sudden started taking away all the rules of his MCU, killing all of his characters, and blaming the fans if they didn't enjoy it.  It's disrespectful.  Respect the original work while also making a great plot, good action of course, a dedicated team of actors/crew, and you'll have a bomb-a$$ movie.  Great job, Edwards.

StarWars,"I just saw the movie a few days ago and noticed a lot of hate when I watched reviews online. Coming from somebody who didn't like the last two movies in the sequels that much I thought this was awesome.

With Anakin being my favourite character the movie  showed the power that Anakin was trying to find to save his friends and it took a Skywalker and Palpatine to access it.

The Rise of Skywalker: Rey adopts the last name “Skywalker” at the end of the film, thus being the Skywalker that rises (I’m sure the title can also be interpreted as Kylo Ren returning to the light side as Ben Solo but that’s a discussion for another day).

I’ve always wondered where was Dooku when Qui Gon died? I’ve never really looked for the answer it was just this random Star Wars question I’ve always had. Now I have all this time on my hands so I turn to the internet.

StarWars,"I’ve seen a lot of people make this claim and I even remember in Hishe RoS Rey tells Yoda he doesn’t need a lightsaber but I really don’t understand this complaint. Mind you I’m not talking about the lightsaber fights themselves whether you thought Yoda jumping around was goofy or not is subjective. I will concede as much as I liked Yoda fighting his former Padawan it would’ve made more sense (and be cooler) if Windu fought Dooku and saved Yoda fighting for Ep III since the only lightsaber fight we see Windu in is against Sidious which was relatively short and underwhelming 

The biggest reason I see is Yoda is strong enough he doesn’t need a lightsaber. First off ignoring in the prequels Yoda is 30 years younger and hasn’t been humbled like he was after the Clone Wars all Jedi use lightsabers. I’m sure there’s an exception in the EU but overlooking that using a lightsaber isn’t (or at least wasn’t) easy for regular people to do. Even in the EU and canon the few who can use a light saber profusely are typically incredibly trained warriors and use gadgets to help them like Boba Fett or Grevious. So clearly the force plays a part in mastering a lightsaber meaning they’re bound its like asking why Dumbledore needs a wand if he’s a powerful wizard

Even putting that aside I don’t think the prequels assassinates his character and connection to the force. Both against Dooku and Sidious the fights begin with them flexing their abilities of the force. Dooku even says their knowledge of the force is equal and the only way to decide this contest is in a lightsaber duel and partway through the fight against Sidious both of them resort to using the force and throwing the pods around. Even with all that in mind Yoda still uses the force to give himself a boost when fighting

But those are just my thoughts",Why are some people against Yoda using a lightsaber?
StarWars,"So many fans suggest they don’t like things about the ST. Often times though, what many things we would like to be different are big, over arching thematic elements that sort of change the whole story. What we got is what we got, and those three films aren’t changing (for better or for worse) 

So, what are some smaller, maybe even nit picky things you would like to change? Things that wouldn’t alter the story or plot points of the ST, but still would have made the overall execution better for you? 

Things that come to mind for me are “I wish Luke just dropped the saber or gave it right back to Rey, as opposed to throwing it.” I like that he rejected it, just not how he did it. Also, I wish that Rey kissed Ben on the forehead and not on the lips. To me it would have been so much more meaningful and could have easily been taken as romantic or as a platonic love. I also wish theyd called the Wayfinder a Holocron, and described it as a Sith artifact that provides you with knowledge, and in this case, it is a holocron that helps guide you to Exegol

StarWars,"Hi guys, I made a viewing order that, i think, makes it more of a connected story. I know it's not perfect and I wish I could have fit movies in different ways, but this is what I got. It makes the sequels the main story and all the other movies are flashbacks. The timestamps are for D+, but I dont think it makes much of a difference. I would LOVE suggestions on ways to make it better, or if this is just hot garbage. Thank you guys and May the Force be with you.

Exclaimer: I dont want to hear any sequel hate. I love these movies, ALL of them, and I just want to share my love for them.

Start with Force Awakens

Flashback to solo once rey asks Han if he is Han Solo [@ 41:20]

Then once solo ends, pick back up at force awakens

When Han says theres always a way to destroy them, referring to the Death Star, start Rogue One and then A New Hope [@ 1:32:57]

Once A New Hope is done, finish Force Awakens

Watch Last Jedi until Luke says it was the fault of the Jedi that Vader and Palapatine rose to power and start Phantom Menace and going up to the end of Revenge of the Sith [@ 59:40]

Pick up and finish Last Jedi

Start Rise of Skywalker

Start Empire Strikes Back and go until the end of Return of the Jedi when Poe asks Lando how they did it and he says they had each other [@ 1:29:40]

Finish Return of the Jedi and then pick up where you left off at Rise of Skywalker

Now finish Rise of Skywalker",I made a new watch order for the movies
StarWars,We know that they play concurrently with each other. What would you think if someone made an edit putting it into one huge movie and playing it chronologically? Is there a chance it could happen? It would be switching between live action and animation throughout the movie. I think it would be sick and for someone binging the franchise for the first time in chronological order (Watching CW before episode 3) Watching the edit would be the perfect way to conclude the series without going out of the chronological order. What do you think?,How would you feel about a fan edit combining Revenge of The Sith and The Siege of Mandalore into one huge movie? Could it happen?
StarWars,"Or he was redeemed. It's up to you. I have to get this off my chest, because some people seem to think Vader's redemption is objective and they either agree or disagree with the morality.

In real life, nobody is redeemed by someone outside of themselves. There's no one keeping score. Nobody is going to tell you you're officially a good person, now. If you've done wrong, you have to live with those consequences. You have to live with the damage you have done to your relationship with the world.  You can only choose what you are going to do now. You only redeem yourself to yourself by knowing what is in your heart and following that new sense of good by acting good.

The force accepts Anakin into the light, because the force doesn't play by the morality of living beings.  The force doesn’t have emotions.  It doesn’t hold grudges. The force sees what's in a living being's heart, and that’s what matters.  It sees all the things we can't see. We can never see inside another being's heart. We can only piece it together from their actions. We may feel Vader is redeemed, because we see the force's acceptance, and therefore we see inside Vader's heart.  For that reason you could say he's redeemed.  I think there's plenty of valid reasons to believe he's is or isn't redeemed.  The most important thing for me is redemption isn’t really the point.

If you see the ending through each Luke and Vader's point of view, you'll see the ending isn't about redemption, it's about their relationship.  Vader was transformed by Luke’s love and in turn acted out of love for Luke.  Everybody can love.  No matter how good or bad you are, you can feel and act out of love for someone.  Love doesn’t necessarily transform someone from bad to good.  What love can do is soften a heart.  It can transform the inhuman into human.  Vader was transformed from a monster to be feared into a flawed human to be pitied.  From Vader to Anakin.  In those final moments Luke gets to speak with Anakin, not the redeemed villain, but the flawed and complicated human and father that was lost inside his own darkness and unable to love anything but his own power.  The ending isn’t Vader saves Luke from the Emperor, but that Luke saves his father from Vader.  It’s something outside the bounds of labels like good and bad and into the transcendent.","Vader was not redeemed, but he was loved."

StarWars,"I was watching the clip where Mace Windu dies and all I could think while watching it is “yeah, he deserves to die!” He was ignoring Anakin telling him what he should have done, but he went to do it anyway! What! Also, Obi Wan is really rude in the prequels! Bruh! The dark side is more likeable than the Jedi! People who didn’t watch the originals would probably think the dark side were the protagonists since the Jedi are just doing whatever even if it’s not the Jedi way and just being rude as fuck!",The prequels make the Jedi seem more evil than the dark side
StarWars,"Since you guys liked the last one so much, Im posting another snippet for constructive critique. The scene in question takes place on one of the lowest levels of coruscant, as Kylo Ren desperately searches for something revealed to him in a sith holocron, something he believes will give him the edge he needs to with a galactic civil war and purge the galaxy of the jedi and their influence once and for all. 

""Kylo and his men push onwards, before finally arriving at their destination. The structure they find is ancient, its entrance surrounded by pillars of blackened stone, carved with symbols that kylo cannot make out as being of jedi or sith origin. He feels a presence calling out to him, and he, flanked by his knights and inquisitors, proceed into the structure. They head down ancient corridors, the walls marked in a dead language and lightsaber marks from battles fought long ago. Finally, they enter a chamber that appears to be an amphitheater. 

At one end, there appears a figure, draped in shadows. The figures breathing is labored and mechanical. Kylo reaches out with the force, demands this specter reveal its identity. The figure turns, igniting a lightsaber as the red glow illuminates its face, revealing the mask of darth vader. This specter is clad in damaged armor, melted and twisted by fire. As it moves forward, the knights of ren take a defensive stance as kylo ignites his saber. He demands to know the specters true identity, that darth vader died on endor. The specter speaks in the voice of darth vader as it states that it is kylo’s undoing. It then advances, moving unnaturally swift as it cuts down one of kylos knights. They attempt to advance and encircle it, but they and the inquisitors are no match for a full sith lord. Kylo looks back to where they entered, but the entry way has been blocked by stone. He then turns to face his grandfather’s image, his knights and inquisitors laying dead upon the ground, some in more than one piece.

 Kylo takes up a defensive stance as he declares that he will not be defeated by a ghost, and that his grandfather was weak, beholden to his emotions and sentimentality. But vader counters that kylo ren is but a child in a mask, a failure. He then delivers a strong downward blow which kylo blocks, his own lightsaber pushed to within an inch of his face. Vader tells him that kylos attempts to complete his legacy are a folly, and that his failure to learn from vaders mistakes will be his doom. They continue to exchange blows, with kylo jumping backwards to gain distance. He attempts to use the force in anger, to hold back darth vader, but its of no use as darth vader advances, blade in hand. Realizing his death is close at hand, kylo attempts to strike out at his grandfather, but dath vader parries his blows until finally, they are locked in place as kylo attempts to hold off his grandfathers saber, the blade growing closer to his face. Out of moves, he quickly moves his head, turning off his lightsaber and dropping it from his hand, before grabbing it with his other and reigniting it aimed squarely at vaders chest. When kylo looks upon his opponent though, he no longer sees the specter of darth vader, but of Anakin skywalker.""",Yet another snippet from my episode 9 rewrite
StarWars,"I think that Phasma was a criminally underused character in the sequels, and while additional materials like comics certainly expanded on her character, it's really a shame that she (at least according to people who worked on Episode 8) is dead. She was used for little more than gags and didn't get the imposing presence she should've had.

I really would've liked to see an arc for her set after episode 8 (or even after episode 9) where she comes to realization with the fact that the First Order failed, and that what it stood for was evil. Perhaps there's still potential for something like this, since her death hasn't been confirmed in-universe (only by the actors).

Your thoughts?",It's a shame we won't get more Captain Phasma
StarWars,"I just joined this sub a few hours ago. I’m sorry if I’m essentially reposting something that somebody else has already posted forever ago. 

I’ve been rewatching the Star Wars movies throughout this coronavirus quarantine. I’m also a huge EU nerd. I’ve been thinking a lot about the prophecy revolving around Anakin. The prophecy of course is that Anakin Skywalker, the child with a midi-chlorian level surpassing even the most renowned Jedi and Sith in know history would bring complete balance to the force.

I’ve seen tons of posts stating that Darth Vader killing the Emperor was the fulfillment of the prophecy. I’ve also seen posts that Luke Skywalker was the actual chosen one because he fulfilled his fathers destiny. I disagree with these theories. 

In RotS Obi-wan says, “You were meant to destroy the Sith, not join them.” In RotS yoda also mentions that the prophecy could have been misread. In EU the sith have a very similar prophecy about a very powerful dark side user who would destroy the Sith. This would allow the Sith order to be rebuild in a different, more productive way. Neither of these views reflect the prophecy as it is written.

The prophecy clearly states that balance will be brought to the force. How can the force be balanced if either the light side or dark side has more control over the galaxy than the other? Either option is not a leveled playing field. The only way to bring balance to the force is to completely destroy both the Sith and the Jedi. I believe that the 3rd trilogy attempted to do this. Obviously the 3rd trilogy was a complete failure in this aspect as well as MANY others. 

The correct ending to the Saga was for Luke to find a balance between dark and light. The ability to harness both aggression and restraint would be the ultimate culmination of the force. I believe that Darth Vader came to this realization just before his death. He was defensive of his son and angry with the Emperor for attempting to supplant him, but at the same time he required calculated focus in order to cloud the Emperor’s mind from his true intentions. Think about how powerful Palpatine was. He was able to implant thoughts into other people’s heads in order to bend their will. He was also able to conceal his power from the entire Jedi Order. It would take complete balance to defeat a foe with such cunning and raw power. 

The prophecy was misread by the Jedi because it was clouded by their dogmatic view. This is why the Jedi failed. The Sith failed for the same exact reason. Instead of reading the prophecy with an open mind, they both attempted to bend the meaning of the prophecy to fit their own view of the galaxy. Without an all encompassing view of the force the Jedi and the Sith were doomed to repeat their cycle of destruction until the end of time.

Luke was supposed to have learned from his father and embraced both sides of the force. Anakin’s entire story arc was supposed to be the lesson that would teach every generation of force user for eternity.

The Jedi Code: 

There is no emotion, there is peace
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge
There is no passion, there is serenity
There is no chaos, there is harmony
There is no death, there is the force

The Sith Code: 

Peace is a lie, there is only passion
Through passion, I gain strength
Through strength, I gain power
Through power, I gain victory
Through victory, my chains are broken, the force shall set me free

Combine these codes:
 
There is no harmony without chaos
There is no serenity without passion
There is no strength without knowledge
There is no peace without victory
There is only the force

Anakin fulfilled his destiny by acting as the preverbal stepping stone to inner balance.

StarWars,"After seeing tros I felt there was a huge missed potential for the Knights. I do know why they werent included as much, but I still want to express my thoughts on a way they could have been included.

First off, during the opening scene with Kylo shredding through his enemies, the Knights could have been included accompanying him and tearing down ranks as well as showing each of their fighting styles. And no, I don't mean specifically showing each on individually I mean just a general wide shot of them going through combat, just a simple extra 45 seconds or something. I felt it would have showed the Knights level of threat and experience in addition to not taking up alot much screen time.

A few other scenes that could have been included is a brief encounter before Finn, Po, and Chewie get into the millennium falcon to rescue Rey. Example of how this scene might go: Finn is lagging behind as they run to the Falcon, out of nowhere Trudgen and Vicrul come out to try and re-capture him and they begin fighting, Finn using the same baton Phasma fought him with. Finn is clearly getting over powered by both Knights so Po comes to help after he orders chewie to start the falcon. Soon, reinforcements being filling the room as chewie begins firing at them using the falcons turret, the knights are winning but back off of the fight as chewie clears the first wave of reinforcements and begins aiming the turret at them. Po and Finn narrowly being their escape as the Knights begin firing their blasters at them. but as they do chewie aims and begins to fire, but both swiftly dodge and move to cover.

I feel this would have displayed some more raw skill in battle, even besting main characters who would normally insta-win via plot armor while avoiding free kills that these main characters always get on enemy characters, hence chewie not being able to kill them with the turret.

One last major fight that could have had more was Kylo vs the Knights. Before I get into it I feel a major plot that should have changed was Leia's death, I feel it should have happened during this scene, here's why. During the fight scene between Rey and Kylo Rey still stabs Kylo but instead she just force heals him and leaves instead of Leia dying halfway through. Instead, Kylo begins to feel the light side more, but still battles the dark as well. He still goes to Exogul, but hes kind of in between like a grey jedi for a while, Palpatine senses this and sends the knights to capture him since he is considered a non-sith, making him a lost cause in Palpatines eyes.

The fight would go something like this: The knights still beat the shit out of Kylo until Rey senses his struggle between Light and dark (More light than dark though) and gives him the lightsaber while speaking to him via the force. When he pulls out the light saber, the Knights instantly enter combat mode against him instead of standing around for 3 seconds like idiots. Ap'lek showcases his smoke here, casuing the area around kylo to be filled with smoke. As the  smoke surrounds him he begins using his force sense to try and find where the Knights are around him when blaster fire from Kuruk and Cardo come at Kylo. Kylo begins deflecting the shots then abruptly they stop as Trudgen, Ap'lek and Ushar emerge from the smoke to attack. A fight insues as they team up on Kylo. Kylo begins losing the fight as palpatine mentally torments him into returning to the dark, he offers to spare him (palpatine is lying to manipulate him). More smoke begins to cloud the area as they fight and now the Knights begin to try and trick Kylo by returning to the smoke. Out of the smoke comes a thick wall of flames from Cardo and Kylo backs up to only come in range of the other knights as one last fight insues. During the fight Leia notices Kylo's struggle and repeats what she did earlier, but instead it happens here. When she dies, Kylo feels the influence of the Lightside, and sends a massive force blast around him removing all the smoke and knocking the knights down, this is when he beings dispatching them. Kylo begins taking them out with ease, much like how Luke did in the comic but not as fast, he ultimately comes out more powerful and ready to kill palpatin in honor of what Leia just did for him.

I know its a wall, but its been on my mind frequently and thought I would share, I know their might be a few issues plot wise when connecting it together with what the film is now, but just imagine this scene on its own, I feel it would be a more honorable death to them then what they got.",Scenes the Knights of Ren could have had (Read if you enjoy made up scenarios that would look cool in star wars)
StarWars,"I'm sure this has been asked before but I can't for the life of me find answers online for some reason lmao. Feel free to link it if you have it. So! Empire and Rebellion, Republic and Separatists, Old Republic and Sith Empire, Resistance and First Order. Who was right in each case? I know the bad guys are designed to be bad, but if you really look at them everyone has a case to be right. Thoughts? We all have opinions but try and base this off of facts and not ""I loved the clones so the Republic is best,"" and stuff like that",Which factions were right?
StarWars,"In my opinion palpatine coming back as a cyborg with abilities like grievous would’ve been much more badass than the weird clone he came in. Could have helped kept him from being overpowered from his lightning but put a better emphasis on his light saber combat, which I wanted to see much more than the stereotypical lighting overpowering the hero like he did with literal all his other appearances. 

Show how despite being both the chosen one of both the force and the sith doctrines palpatine can take them both on without breaking a sweat.",What is Palpatine came back as a cyborg like grievous and not a clone?
StarWars,"Yellow is the color of youth, creation, technology so Rey’s creation of her golden/yellow lightsaber on Tatooine in the final Skywalker Saga movie is a direct riff on Anakin’s creation of golden C-3PO and his yellow podracer on Tatooine in the first Skywalker Saga movie. Anakin has maintained his association with the color yellow with his use of the Naboo starfighter, the airspeeder in Attack of The Clones, and his Jedi starfighters in The Clone Wars and Revenge of The Sith. This was a severe sign of him not being able to mature because of the Jedi’s teachings that use reason to hold back his passions. Rey’s creation of a yellow lightsaber at the end of her journey is indicative of the renewal of a new childhood rather than a regression to it. She dies a Palpatine and retires her adulthood as she is reborn a Skywalker (via Ben Solo’s life force) and is given a new childhood. The final scene is her returning to a familiar home to honor the Skywalker legacy by burying the lightsabers and also to make peace with her own upbringing.

The green lightsaber represents the balance that’s holding passion (red) and reason (blue) in tension. Qui-Gon Jinn wielded a green lightsaber which represents his underlying dislike of the teachings of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker wielded a green lightsaber as he was tempted by both the light and dark sides. The yellow lightsaber represents the transcending of both the red and the blue. The red lightsaber, representative of the Sith, is cast into the sea. The blue lightsabers, representative of the Jedi, are buried underneath the surface of land. The yellow lightsaber is a symbol that represents the Skywalker family, a family known cheat the deaths of the ones they love by virtue of compassion and self-sacrifice.",The Meaning Behind Rey’s Yellow Lightsaber
StarWars,"First, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. Second, let me say that I'm only a casual Star Wars fan. 

So how does time work? When they say a year, is it 365 days? Seems unlikely since that is Earth time. Wouldn't each planet have a different amount of days in a year? Not to mention a different amount of hours in a day. 

Is there a Galactic standard year, like the standard language? Is 12 BBY 12 Earth years? Would seem to be a similar time frame since Solo takes place in 12 BBY and Rouge One takes place in 0 BBY. 

Maybe I'm just overthinking the whole thing?",How does time work in the Star Wars universe?
StarWars,How many of y'all would have rather seen a Republic Commando series rather than The Mandalorian? Republic Commando is an excellent series of books that doesn't conflict with anything that is canon so Disney could make an exception for it and make it canon as well. It was actually unfinished because the author (Karen Traviss) was working on the 6th book when Disney bought Star Wars and made everything legends so she never finished the series which is slightly aggravating. A Republic Commando series would be soooo dope,Show of hands here
StarWars,"I'm CERTAIN I will eat my words if the rumors are true. I have complete faith in every hand guiding the show, but right now my anxiety is based around how much I'm loving the Mandalorian's ability to create fantastic new characters. A large part of the appeal is how the show creates brand new characters that feel right at home in Star Wars and (for me) immediately win me over. I don't want that incredible ability to be sidelined in favor of already-established fsn favorites popping up and taking most of the screentime.

StarWars,"So Episode 4 and Rogue One, showed this incredibly great mission to eventually take down the catastrophic planet destroying Death Star. They succeed..

Then they had to go ahead and have a 2nd one being in construction and operating in Episode 6. Which I really didn't mind..

However, Episode 7 The Force Awakens had to basically unnecessary include this huuuuge planet that had half of it hollowed out to be a 'super upgraded' version of a death star that had a much more powerful cannon that could destroy multiple planets at once.
(Mission to destroy that ensues)

I didn't mind in episode 9 that every single Star Destroyer fleet on Exegol had a planet destroying cannon on them. Was badass, just odd they didn't go for that in the very first place..

So anyways, my point being, it just felt like, ""oh hey, all that work we did in the movie(s) to bring down the Death Star, which resulted in many tragic and emotional losses. Well, it's okay, because some time after destroying it, the Empire is gonna be like, oh well guess what, we're back in stock with your favorite galaxy destroying battle station!""

StarWars,"So with the 3rd episode of the Ahsoka arc having been released with one more left for her part of the story leading into the Siege of Mandalore, her character development has been quite lack luster to me. It feels like a lot of the spotlight is being given to the supporting characters and a lot of good character development for one of our main characters, Ahsoka, is being swept a bit to the side. 

Don’t get me wrong, having good fleshed out side/filler characters is always a plus because it adds a lot to the over all narrative. 

However, it seems like Disney is missing a big opportunity here with Ahsoka having to confront her grey side transitioning having just left the Jedi order and questioning her ideals and moral codes. When Raffa and Trace were telling the truth to Ahsoka about how their parents died in detail involving some Season 2 moments with Cad Bane/Ziro, I went back to watch the episode (Hostage Crisis) and as far as I could tell the whole scene doesn’t quite match up with what Raffa and Trace tell us, but that’s a different issue. 

My main issue was that Disney could have pulled an “age of ultron” moment where ahsoka would’ve been the Jedi who was responsible for the destruction of the speeder carrying Ziro that caused Raffa and Trace’s parents’ deaths. She would’ve had to deal with the guilt of having innocent blood on her hands when in her mind she was doing something inherently “good” but it still had bad consequences because of the situation. This would’ve played much better into their (Disney) narrative of Trace and Raffa not liking and keeping their distance from Jedi for the reasons they gave, which were very solid reasons. 

It just seems like her portrayal so far in these last three episodes haven’t been much character development that I was expecting since we know where she ends up in Rebels and how her attitude has changed since leaving the Order. This is just my opinion and was wondering what you guys thought about the current Ahsoka arc?",Unpopular Opinion: Ahsoka deserves a better character building arc - so far

StarWars,"I don't know if this has been discussed here to not so i thought i would throw my theory out to you all to see what you think and if others have some input too.

So, I have a theory about the fate of Ezra and Thrawn. At the end of Season 4 of Rebels Thrawn and Ezra jump to hyperspace with the aid of the Purrgil. I think that Ezra was able to use his ability to comunnicate with creatures through the force to jump with the Purrgils and control their travel through Hyperspace.

In the Thrawn books we discover that the Chiss Assendancy use force sensitive children to nagivate through the Uknown Regions due to its changing nature. We also see Darth Vader doing this too. These groups use the naviation controls of the ships themselves to travel so i think that Ezra was able to do it via the Purrgils.

This leaves the question of where they end up. I personally think that Ezra was listening to the force and has ended up in some remote location in the Unknown Regions and have come in contact with the Grisks that are in the Thrawn book or are somewhere else in the Unkown Regions.

Thanks for reading, i'd like to hear what you think.","[Spoilers] Personal theory about the fate of certain characters (SPOILERS FOR: Rebels (all seasons), Thrawn, Thrawn: Alliences and Thrawn: Treason"
StarWars,"Alright, I just watched the first episode of this supposedly ""great"" Star Wars show, and while I wasn't expecting much, it hit FAR below the mark of Star Wars and is pretty piss poor as a piece of standalone entertainment without the franchise power behind it: ""urr muh gawd babi yoda!!!!""

To start, I totally forgot this was Disney. It felt like a Netflix treatment of a franchise: smaller sets, tight shots, scarce landscapes with just a single character in it etc. Anything to save some money and it shows. It was really weak, and the garbage editing only exacerbated this entourage of banality. Where's the big slow pans and the large establishing shots? Oh that's right. No budget for those lol. 

The pacing, setups, delivery of lines: Mediocre and expected. Nothing new. No new boundaries pushed. No surprises. ""I said you made me spill my DRANK!""

The score: This is the biggest insult this show throws at you. It's probably one of the worst matched soundtracks I have ever witnessed in a show. It certainly doesn't fit what is on screen and is DEFINITELY NOT Star Wars. Like the whole western theme in the OK Corral shootout... What the hell is this show? Again, this is DEFINITELY NOT Star Wars. The music was such a big part of this franchise and this is like pissing on John Williams head.

The Scenes: These are a bunch of pre-scripted sequences that writers pulled out of antiquity and just dressed it up in Star Wars. Again, nothing new. No new territory discovered. I rest my case with the OK Corral shootout scene and ""I'm going to walk into a bar..."" scene. So original. This is Star Wars. There are sooooo many cool things you can do. 

The Characters: Weak as hell, including the Mandalorian with his garbage one liners. When your main character is in a mask, they need to emote in other ways. Have you seen the lame pansexual walk this dude has? His voice is alright but it's just... there. It works but is nothing special. There's no mannerisms or personality to the Mandalorian at all. You could literally put ANY actor/actress in that role and they could pull it off. Only Edward Norton can be King Baldwin IV in Kingdom of Heaven. Only James Earl Jones can be the voice of Darth Vader. But the Mandalorian is so copy and paste that a 50 year old female could play him, with only an extra for the stunts. 

This is what happens when people are used to mediocre entertainment and something with some franchise power comes along. It tricks people into believing it's far better than it is. 

This show is another whore on the corner for Disney and Star Wars. They took the supreme IP of all time and managed to make it as typical as an episode of Seinfeld. 

Well done.",The Mandalorian is the biggest pile of crap
StarWars,"Anybody remember the old Star Wars radio drama by Brian Daley that was broadcast back in 1981?

It was made without any knowledge of how the saga would evolve in the future (except ESB, maybe? Not sure given the broadcast date) and yet, some of the lines actually do foreshadow things.

**Episode 3: Vader Still Hates Sand**

  This is the final scene aboard the Tantive IV. Vader growls ""I want them found even it means tearing apart bit by bit this miserable speck of a planet. This **TATOOINE!!!**"" Hilarously over the top cartoon villain stuff. Yet, 20 years later, it turns out... he really *does* have a reason to hate Tatooine. It's not just generic disdain for an Outer Rim slumworld.

**Episode 5: Obi-Wan is what he hates: a politician.**

""He betrayed **your father** and murdered him. **His** name was Darth Vader.""

Nice bit of weasely phrasing and plausible deniability there, old man. (And though ESB was already out, we didn't know whether Vader was telling the truth. That was actually the Big Question all the way up to ROTJ's release.)

**Episode 8: The ability to destroy planets is no match for the power of incest.**

This is the extended scene of Vader interrogating Leia with the mind probe. Here's part of the dialog: ""Your father commands you to tell us. Don't you wish to please your father? Then tell me what you did with those plans."" Umm... now I'm sure Lucas didn't let Daley in on *that* family link.",Star Wars Radio Drama: Unintentional foreshadowing/funny lines.
StarWars,"Original:

Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. 

Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite:

It has been 31 years since the destruction of the Death Star II at the hands of Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance. In the absence of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic has established a new galactic government, and an era of peace.

With the destruction of the Sith at the Battle of Endor, Luke begins to rebuild the Jedi Order in the unknown regions, far from the politics and problems of the galaxy. So that one day when the Sith return, the Jedi may once again be ready to defeat them.

In Luke's absence, and away from prying eyes, a remnant of the Galactic Empire has once again resurfaced and proclaimed themselves as The First Order. Under their banner they have laid claim to a number of star systems in the outer rim and unknown regions, far from the influence and fleets of the New Republic.

As tensions rise between the New Republic and the First Order, Leia Organa leads a covert military group to investigate and combat the advances of the First Order on the galaxy. As well as to find her brother without the restrictions of the New Republic.

In this troubling time a previous member of the Rebellion has stumbled across a clue to the whereabouts of Luke and the Jedi Order. And a pilot has been sent by Leia to verify and extract this information, hoping to bring an end to the ever expanding First Order...",The Force Awakens Intro (Rewrite)
StarWars,"As an Australian I cannot help but notice some of the similarities between Naboo and Australia.

Now while Australia isn’t directly ruled by the queen we are still part of the commonwealth. It’s very complicated to explain. Basically the queen is still in charge but our government holds all the real power. Similar to the queen of Naboo being at the whims of the senate. Bit of a stretch I know. 

The planet is a colony of mostly farmers, again very similar to the first fleet of Australia. Minus all the convicts, they even have a day of celebration for it. That is very similar to Australia.

The Divide between the Human and Gungans is also very similar to the divide between Settlers and Aboriginal People in Australia. Although I doubt the humans kidnapped Gungans to make them more human like.

Trade is a very important part of Australia, as well as for Naboo. If Australia was blocked from trade it would be disastrous.

All of this make me feel like Naboo would be the Australia of Star Wars.

This was a dumb idea but the idea kept nagging at me.

Let me know what you think.",Naboo is the Australia of Star Wars
StarWars,"Lightsabers, lasers, aliens, space ships, planets, moons, droids, space wizards...everything about Star Wars is tailor made for little kids to go nuts over. However, almost anyone who watches these movies for the first time as adults are unimpressed. 

The original trilogy has mediocre or sometimes bad acting (other than James Earl Jones and Harrison Ford). The story is a generic hero's journey at best, and at worst it's the imagination of a nerdy man-child run amuck. The jokes are bad, the editing transitions are tacky. I firmly believe those movies were carried by John Williams and whoever was involved with the special effects and the prop / set / model design. 

The prequel trilogy is even worse than the original. These movies are so poorly written, they make the original scripts look like the work of Shakespeare. To make matters worse, the early 2000s CGI has aged horribly, these movies are aesthetically atrocious. 

With all that beings said, I love the original Star Wars movies and the prequels. Why? Because I watched them as a kid and I have fond memories of being blown away by jedis and stuff 

However, I simply cannot get into the newer trilogy because I'm not a kid anymore so I'm not really interested in fictional space wizards at this point. Unless they can actually deliver a riveting story with well crafted and memorable characters, I'm not going to be able to get into a new Star Wars movie just because it has cool space ships and lasers",Nostalgia can only go so far
StarWars,"So first off, just wanna say that I like the ST, and I like Rise, but I can't help but wonder what damage it does to the  overall canon, because let's face - that was a really stupid plot. I'm not really sure what the answer to that movie is for Disney, it doesn't seem like a good jumping off point for anything that doesn't sweep it under the rug. We're getting more films though, and I think whatever's next can be boiled down to 2 options: HR and direct continuation. Do they go w/ High Republic which distances us from IX time-wise and carves out a new era in Star Wars, with albeit,  more prequels, OR do they embrace IX's messiness and push the canon forward, which is giving us more of these characters who weren't served well by the ST?

StarWars,"In my opinion the ultimate Star Wars experiences are Timothy Zhan's Thrawn Trilogy, and the KOTOR Duelogy.
Not only is the Thrawn Trilogy so well written and had Mara Jade make her debut, but its what made Star Wars relevant to the public again. If it werent for those books we may not have ever gotten the prequels, sequels, or any other spin off. 

The KOTOR games are phenomenal as they seem to make you feel like a part of the Star Wars galaxy more than any other game.

.I love to analyse films and seek the deeper meaning that what they director placed in directly to tell the story more discreetly, Star Wars the clone wars season seven has lived up to my standard of media scrutiny, the subtle animations of the environment to give the story at large more character traits, not forcing anything but letting them come through naturally from a timeline point of view, episode 4 was one of the most interesting piece of media to watch from this early in in the month, the time placed in these episodes are nothing but the result of hard labour and tough love from the Star Wars community globally (enough to put a hashtag in the promo art) to the hard working animators to the voice actors, directors and studio staff.

StarWars,"One of the things that frustrated me most about the prequels is that nobody catches onto or suspects Palpatine may be a Sith Lord (or at least, a guy who was after dictatorial powers) until years into the Clone Wars. McDiarmid sells the viewer on Palpatine's subtlety, cunning, and power as a Sith Lord; but it is still hard to fathom how nobody suspected him. 

Yet in the movies, nobody really does suspect he has ill motives until RotS. 

Is there any EU evidence of Jedi or politicians who figured out what Palpatine was (prior to RotS)?",Did any Jedi or Politicians suspect Palpatine was a Sith Lord (or otherwise bent on domination) prior to RotS?
StarWars,"It seems like the main characters in the PT (Anakin, Mace, Sidious, Dooku, Maul, Yoda, Obi-Wan) are vastly more powerful than almost all of the other Jedi/force users. My evidence for this is:

* How comically easily it was for Anakin to kill all the Jedi in the temple, despite his later defeat in a duel with Obi-Wan
* How comically easy it was for Sidious to kill the Jedi Masters who accompanied Mace to arrest him, despite his eventual defeat to Mace
* Vader's ability to hunt down, outclass, and kill the  remaining Jedi after RotS, despite his having lost the majority of his strength in the force on Mustafar (60% according to Lucas)

Does this sound like a fair assessment, or am I off-base?  Is it fair to say that the main characters in the PT are heads and shoulders above the other force users in power, as I have indicated?

Myself and my cousins are huge Star Wars fans, and my grandma finally decided to watch the films in their entirety so she could talk about it with us. Below is the email she sent us after watching (this is copy pasted directly, no edits except removed names and added paragraphs for reading).*


Hi All -- I have been a fan of Star Wars since they started [70's?] and am just now finding out how it all started. The actual beginning of the story eluded me for years and since I never did see it in sequence, I never knew who was fighting who. Just a lot of saber fighting and thousands of guys in white metal something or other. Now I've just finished watching Chapter xi and tomorrow is the Return of the Jedi. Wow!! How exciting is my life in solitary confinement! How amazing George Lucas was to come up with the storyline and the out of this world characters. Chewbacca, Ewodees, Jabba and all those unimaginable critters. 

I can also see why the children back then loved those saber swords. They looked less threatening than ordinary swords but they were actually more so. I saw the original Anakin when he was very young and handsome and a nice guy and then I LOVED Darth Vader in all his blackness. I missed so much of all this back then that I watched for two full afternoons and again tomorrow I get to see the newer one [to me] with Adam Driver in it. I'll miss Darth and his flying black cape. I never knew why he was wrapped in black until I saw the movie when he fell down somewhere and got burned all over. Again WOW - they put him back together again like Humpty Dumpty!! 

I especially love Obi Ben Obin? and the role he played in it all. And who didn't love Joda? I actually teared up when he was dying. I was talking to (young cousin) at your Xmas dinner about Yoda and I wish I could remember what she told me about the Baby Yoda. Is he in any future movies? How original is that guy?? Lucas again with his great imagination. 

I actually liked Harrison Ford in this series. I have never thought of him as a very good actor but he proved me wrong in this movie. Well Now that I know who is who and why it matters, I can enjoy the rest of the series and know who the Force is and the Empire and the Jedi. But I really can't see how the newer series can possibly top the original ones with a young Luke and Leia and Chewie. Did Chewie make it into the newer ones? But of course, he must have, because Han Solo is there in all his senior years and holding it all together. 

Well, boys and girls, I'm just happy to join the Star Wars followers and see what outer space is going to open up to me now.  Now we can all discuss this series over (aunt's) next dinner party.     Signing Off, for now,      Love to All     ","My 92 year old grandma's reaction to watching Star Wars...

StarWars,"Hi all, finally watched the rise of Skywalker for the first time, and was fairly happy about the movie. Long time fan saw a new hope at the age of 4 years old on TV in 1993 (abc channel). Been reading books, playing the games and watching series that tie all of this but still seem to be missing info on events, battles, etc. I was wondering if there was a book or many books that really do tie everything down from episode 1 to episode 9. for example does the encyclopedias are worth it. Thank you and I hope that you can understand my question (French guy =P)",Information that Will fill the gaps
StarWars,"Firstly let me just say this reason is extremely personal, so if you dont agree that's fine.

When I was a teenager I was your typical emo nerd who thought he was so smart and worldly. During the time I was a big fan of the old sceptics, debunking ""dumb"" religious people with facts and logic. Then the Anti Feminist stuff started getting popular, at the time I didnt care what they the skeptics were saying, I just liked them spouting facts to prove that someone was an idiot. Before I knew it I had fell down the rabbit hole of the alt right. I said and did alot of things I'm not proud of. I'm just so glad I didnt use social media at the time.

But then TLJ came out. Before then I had thought kylo was just a whiny loser but after TLJ I saw alot of myself in him. Feeling crushed by expectations, desperate for approval and having a propensity for lashing out in anger. This started my journey out of that world. 

This is why I like Kylo Ren and the first order mean so much to me. They speak to my experiences with falling into a dark path and I am so grateful I got to see ben turn back. Also to those who thought Hux was pathetic and wasted potential for an intimidating figure let me just tell you that he is the most accurate depiction of the alt right I have ever scene.

I guess this is also why I relate to finn and Jahnna so much as well.

StarWars,"I realized that there are some pretty epics pieces of music from the films that are not available on the Apple Music albums. I don’t know if this is the same for a Spotify. Some pieces I recognized are missing include the music in ROTJ when Luke overpowers Vader, the music played in TLJ where Finn and Rose are taken to the hangar to be executed (this piece also plays when Finn is leading Poe down a hallway in TFA), and also the epic version of the Emperor’s theme when it is played in TLJ while Snoke tortures Rey. I know I’m forgetting some other key pieces that aren’t available but those are a few I could think of off the top of my head. It just confuses me why the full soundtracks wouldn’t be available. That really needs to be fixed.",Why are the complete soundtracks not available on streaming services?

Is it about Rey? Finn? The OT cast? I really can’t tell. Like the OT all three movies made sense and so did the sequels. That doesn’t mean that the new trilogy is bad (personally I think it was bad), but it just seems wildly incoherent. I thought it was about Kylo, then I thought it was about snoke, and then I thought it was about palpatine.

StarWars,"Lucas and Disney went to great lengths to portray Palpatine as their ultimate evil. But was anything he did ACTUALLY unquestionably evil? Or is it just a problem with point of view? 

Think about it this way...

Monarch in exile. Supernatural powers. People were hurt on his way to the top. He could be freaking Elsa. 

Sure, he wiped out the Jedi. But the Jedi were an opposing political entity that ALSO tried to exert their will upon the galaxy through force. What makes them better? They **also** ignored suffering, and slavery, and all kinds of underhanded dealings. They claimed it was because they weren’t a policing force, while perpetually policing the galaxy when it suited their needs. He just deemed it beneath him. Same results. 

So again, is there ANYTHING that he did that could be deemed unquestionably evil?",Star Wars Morality
StarWars,"Thought I’d finally put down some of my thoughts on the sequels and what “could have been” with this exciting news.







I really appreciate these new movies.

But I really hated TLJ. It seemed that Rian Johnson had never seen a Star Wars movie in his entire life. Everything from making it super political, to stopping heroic sacrifices, to skipping past subtle storylines, to altering everything we know about hyperspace, to Leia Poppins, TO MAKING LUKE (THE MAN WHO SAW GOOD IN THE MOST EVIL MAN IN THE UNIVERSE) SUDDENLY  BECOME AN EVIL IMPULSIVE OLD MAN WHO TRIES TO KILL A KID WHO HE GOT SCARED OF, and even to having Luke die off by a force power that is almost played off as easy. So much wrong with that movie. People didn’t appreciate the prequels as much as they do now when they were released, and I had very high hopes with the release of TFA (I even got totally sucked into the Rey Palpatine theory as it would be a very cool counter to the other six films (which also brings me back to TLJ having just saying “naw duck the main storyline and mystery” and having Rey’s parents be “nobody”) I could see objectively how it was enjoyable and introduced new and fun characters. I was especially stuck on the small hints of Finn later becoming a Jedi, or at least force sensitive (which was also ruined by Rian Johnson—who made him the “Ha ha XD funny token black guy”. Hell his first scene in the movie is “look how clumsy and stupid I am. Haha there’s water coming out of me isn’t that funny?”) which you can see JJ try to salvage in TRS. I was in the boat that everybody was hating on it because it was new and a soft reboot that we would all end up appreciating in another 20 years. And boy did that stop with TLJ. I still even tried to appreciate that movie, hell even though I hated the scene I was optimistic to explore a force sensitive Leia—RIP Carrie Fischer—but unfortunately that was out of anybody’s control. Crait was beautiful and I enjoyed Adam Driver. Speaking of Adam Driver—I thoroughly enjoyed him and his portrayal of Kyle Ren. I know a lot of people did not, but I thought it was perfect—a conflicted “wannabe Vader” who struggled to contain his emotions. I thought he was very intriguing and was excited to explore his backstory, until Rian came up with that excuse for and origin story. And I also enjoyed Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, John Boyega—the whole bunch. Really I could just see the sequels to turn out to be a beautiful thing that was just being hated on and was under-appreciated. And I strongly believe that this would have stuck through the whole trilogy, had it not been for Rian Johnson and the cesspool that’s is The Last Jedi. 

tl:dr If JJ had had full reigns (or nearly any director besides Rian Johnson) of the movies—especially TLJ than I believe that the sequels would eventually be remembered fondly, had a consistent and memorable storyline, and would have just been all around great Star Wars films (AKA super hyped for the recuts etc. 😃)",My hot take on the sequels (recut hype!😃😃)
StarWars,"As I've stated before, I'm watching all the Star Wars (movies and cartoons) in chronological order. I first watched star wars when it came on TV in the early 80's. I honestly don't remember if I saw the other 2 (episodes 5 &amp; 6) at the theaters or on TV but I surely watched them before the remakes. With that said, watching the remakes are cool and all but I want the original theatrical versions. I just wish disney would plat all versions or at least the original theatrical versions. What about you?",I wish Disney+ would show the original theatrical version of Star Wars
StarWars,"Sorry this is a little all over the place.  I just watched episode IX for the first time, and I'm trying to make sense of it all, particularly what this means to the lore of Anakin Skywalker.

Given Palpatine's history, if you told me he revived himself my first assumption would be that he would want to train a new apprentice, but he doesn't.

He creates Snoke as a manifestation of himself instead of training a new apprentice to effect his will.  He then lures Rey to Exegol to try to make her become not the new Sith apprentice, but the new Master.  Is it that he lacks the strength to train a new apprentice and needed someone already trained to become the new Master?  Is something about the mechanics of the rule of two fundamentally broken due to the actions of Anakin?  I feel like there is something really interesting going on here and it's kind of an itch I can't scratch.  

It seems Anakin did indeed end the rule of two, but did not end the Sith.  I'm also inclined to say he brought balance to the force by helping end a corrupt Jedi order.  Yoda talks about how arrogant young jedi have become in the prequels, and his force ghost talks about how it is time to move on from the old ways in the sequels.  But more to the point, we see Rey use the ability to transfer life to heal people instead of hurt them - this practice of any form was considered unnatural by the jedi order from as early as Ajunta Pall.  But Rey shows that no particular knolwedge is inherently evil, it's what you do with it.  The Jedi order had too much fear and pride, and embraced form over function, so I think part of Anakin's destiny of balancing the force was rebooting the jedi order.  Does that make sense?

Side question: was the dyad between Rey and Ben broken when Palpatine absorbed it?",Why was Palpatine recruiting Rey to be the Master instead of the Apprentice?
StarWars,"I would have loves an ST with Darth Caedus as the main villan, even if they changed him a little. I wouldn't actually care if they kept him as Jacen Solo, but I wanted to see Caedus in an actual movie because Luke said he was as powerful as Vader, and that's something Kylo Ren was definitely not.

Plus the dude was able to fight with a hole in his stomach and a missing arm, and I just think that's badass for some reason.

StarWars,"I don't mean for this to be a negative post though I get how the title could make it seem easy enough to slide down that way. But the other day reading the TROS novelization and hearing the call-ins the ghost and Kaz and Alphabet squadron I finally gave up on getting anything with Rogue Squadron in it. I had constantly been holding out hope that some eventually we would get stories of them in the NEU (sure we got them getting named in the main comic but that is about it. Sadly we haven't really even gotten pilot!luke in the main comic) if just between Hope Dies and Endor. But after the book I've finally given up on it. If it happens it happens and I will be happy but its not something I'm holding out hope for.

Same for Hyperspace travel which used to be my major pet peeve. Sure I hope that more writers will follow Zhan's ideas of how it works but its a hill i'm giving up.

And honestly I'm just about to give up on getting any post Jakku luke stories anytime soon. If we get any before 2022 I'll be really surprised.

Though their are still things I'm hoping to see. The VD was full of TotJ stuff and their are still all of those unfinished TCW arcs that would make good comics or novels. And more about Qui-gon and Obiwans adventures would be great. Plus everything that is the High Republic.",What is something you have given up on seeing in the NEU and what is something you are still hoping to see
StarWars,"In ROTS he was able to turn an Anakin because he used the info he knew on Anakin and used to to explain how the dark side would actually help him save his wife.  And that he was right that the Jedi were holding him back and that he was more valuable than they were leading on.   He approached him almost as a friend and  tried to use his emotions as sort of a way of selling him on the dark side


Yet in ROTJ, he was just straight up shitting all over Luke and the Rebel and was just directly trying to piss him off 

If his goal was to have Luke as his new apprentice , shouldn’t he have used a different approach ?

StarWars,"I noticed a pretty cool detail at the end of the game when you defeat Trilla that really shows the dichotomy of the Jedi and the Sith. Cere was a true Jedi when she emphasized that SHE failed Trilla echoing what Obi Wan said to Anakin. The first thing Vader tells Trilla when he arrived is that Trilla failed HIM.

I just thought it was a really cool detail that I missed the first time through. (probably due to the shock and awe of Vader). It really shows where their mindset is at.

So since I've been home now due to a certain virus, i figured why not catch up with Star Wars Rebels. So thats just what I did.

StarWars,"The OT is composed of good films from a critical point of view with good storytelling capacity that became instant classics. The introduction of Ewoks might have spoiled a thoughtful ending to the trilogy.

The Prequels show the Jedi at their best yet bring elements with the hopes of appealing to a broader audience like the 'comic relief' and a romance with no chemistry. This trilogy is saved by space Jesus and an infinite provision of memes. 

The Sequels were up to a good start, except for the part where a literal stormtrooper isn't cut in half by Luke Skywalker's former apprentice. then the second movie takes away some of the magic of the Jedi and turns the hero of the OT into an edgy and hard to approach character to say the least. Finally the end of the saga bets on nostalgia and what could've been a self-made character is blood tied to someone who comes out of nowhere, giving the intergalactical conflict the feeling of being a Skywalker vs. Palpatine story.",A simple take on the Skywalker saga.
StarWars,"Sorry if I don't know the full story and if some of my points are wrong this is just what I know and I want more answers and opinions.

So a young kid I remember watching the Original Trilogy on TV once but remember nothing about them now. Since the release of Disney Plus I went on there to watch all the Star Wars movies in Order from 1 - 8. After watching the prequels I decided to research them a bit more and found out the prequels were hated for the actors who played Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). I understand why people found Jar Jar annoying but why Anakin? Specifically why Hayden? Do you hate the prequels and these actors? For me the prequels got more and more engaging as they became more action packed. The story of Anakin/Vader was interesting but also very sad. This made me particularly enjoy Revenge of the Sith.

I remember hearing about Disney now having control of Star Wars and after watching the sequels (7 and 8) I also looked into them. I found out George Lucas' story was mostly scrapped. After watching them I can see why people hate Disney's twist on the sequels, (When browsing the internet I have also heard huge spoilers about Episode 9 so some things I have heard about also make me question the sequels). Did The Force Awakens only earn a lot in the Box Office since it was the first movie Star Wars movie since 2005, because it was the sequels, because it was made by Disney? Now I too have become interested in really wanting to know what George Lucas' plan for the sequels were. Do you think we will ever see them on the big screen? I still am thinking about the sequels but I don't know if I have more questions. Do you hate Disney's sequels?

I have read some stuff on why George Lucas sold it off to Disney and what we know about his sequels. I just felt this community might be able to give me some more insight and their opinions.",The prequels and George Lucas' sequels. Questions and opinions from the perspective of a young teenager.
StarWars,"Here's the thing about the star wars saga, you have the original trilogy, which has a well established problem which is resolved by the end, in the prequel trilogy, they create the original problem and leave it unresolved, but then you have the sequels, which rehash the original in moronic nostalgic fashion. Now, if they had left out the first order/resistance bullshit and focused on what was left, i think we wouldve had a great trilogy, but nooooo the galaxy always has to be in peril, it cant just be one family in peril.

Luke couldve rebuilt the jedi order, leia coulve rebuilt democracy, making mama padme proud, and because she is the reason han became a good guy, her focusing on the government wouldve still left him to turn back to his old ways. Ben couldve still joined the jedi order and to make it relateable and realistic, the adults could hidden vaders true identity from him like kenobi did to Luke, setting little ben off on a path to the darkside when he found out the truth, and the trilogy couldve been about coming together and saving ben from the dark side, a sort of redemption by proxy theme, because anakin didnt have any family to keep him from going dark in the first place, his mom was dead, he tried killing his wife(and kids), and his mentor was just spouting absolute garbage about them being brothers. ""It takes a village..."" Could have also been a theme, as it wouldve been a group effort to save little ben, rey definitely still couldve been worked into that plot, hell even poe and finn, just not as resistance and ex first order. They couldve expounded on snokes character as a last remnant of palpatines empire and a student of the sith, little ben couldve of sought him out when he learns the truth about his grandfather. They couldve ran off to areas of the galaxy where theres still power vaccums from the fall of the empire, setting up obstacles for the good guys, and i could go on but...

StarWars,"In general I thought the prequels had some uninspiring characters.  Rey wasn’t bad but nothing special to me.    She the generic hero and I know Luke was as swell but Luke was more intersecting because of his drive to save his father.

Finn was dumb and somewhat annoying and actor seemed like he was trying way too hard.   Poe was a massive tool and wasn’t funny and was a poor mans version of Han Solo .

But Kylo seems to get a lot of praise and I don’t get it.  He is literally a cheap version of Darth Vader.  Guy who is good Jedi and has a ton of potential and he turns bad and then is redeemed at the end.  Where have we seen that before ???!

StarWars,Back in the 80’s they made 3 movies then disappeared for 16 years. Then they came back for my childhood in the early 2000’s then disappeared again for a decade. I feel like if the last Jedi was as successful as TFA then Star Wars would be similar to the mcu at this point where we would be getting 2-3 Star Wars movies a year. So downvote me all you want I’m genuinely happy the last Jedi killed those plans because of all the backlash. The last thing I want for star wars is it to be like the mcu. They should focus on the mandolorian and that’s it. Take a decade off from making movies cause it’s a big part of what makes Star Wars so special.,Star Wars is special to me because it goes away.

StarWars,"Hi everyone

Just a fun theory. Wife was watching Matilda yesterday on Netflix and something dawned on my that has never come to me before.

What if Matilda wasn't controlling things with her mind through how smart she was but was force sensitive. 

I know what people are thinking....that's a load of crap but think about how she acts. She was always passive and when she did act on people with her force powers she never conflicted lots of harm on her victims, just scared them a bit. Also she has a thirst for learning from a early age, the force may have given her that thirst....all force users have a thirst for knowledge and wisdom....Sith or Jedi.

Another thing Roald Dahl could have been a star wars fan himself, Matilda was published in 1988 a time when the orginal trilogy was massive. He could of taken massive elements from star wars realised that he couldn't use them in a book and change the force to her intelligence last minute.

When they did, they all whipped out lightsabers and began dueling (of the fates :/ 

This lasted for a whole week, and more and more and more people joined each day. On the last day of the week, the room in which my teacher was in had a professor/security guard (either/or, not important). As soon as he heard it, he said “Don’t even think about it”. Everyone whipped out their lightsabers and began dueling.

StarWars,"Right off the bat I know I will get a lot of dislikes for this without people even reading it, though, I also don't care.

Complaints about him that would make him perfect for Star Wars:

**Too patriotic**: Uh . . . this is a damn war people, Star **WARS**. Patriotic might just help it a little bit. Though, someone will need to tell him no American Flags. And as for the actual war aspect, each trilogy is based off of a different war in history, with this guy around, you'll be able to more accurately portray that with Michael at the helm, or he could just come up with an entirely new one.

**Oversexualizes women**: This one may seem inevitable. He will be given constraints, and he will not pick the actors. However, he won't actually need too many of constraints, if anyone remembers in episode 6, Leia spent an entire scene in a friking bikini, I do not believe that Michael Bey can really get much worse than that. Realistically, more aliens in a massive universe would be making sexist jokes, adding a layer of realism to the Star Wars Universe. As for what the characters say and act like, he will have constrictions what he is and isn't allowed to do. Then there's the social media issue, to which I say, Suck It!

**Branding**: Disney does this already so its fine.

**Racist Jokes**: Uh . . . almost every alien race in Star Wars is a walking talking living racist joke already. I really don't think he could change much.

Complaints that could be easily fixed:

**Ruining Beloved Characters**: In my vision, Michael Bey will not have any control over beloved or pre-existing characters with exceptions that would make sense. He would have to create a new story with new characters in this already pre-existing universe. As for the canon, if it messes up the canon more than Rey did, it is non-canon. There, problem solved.

Things that he brings that would improve Star Wars:

**His unique ability to make the armies not complete idiots in his films**: He always makes military competent and grounded, something that has been lacking in Star Wars since the beginning. (Storm troopers can't shoot/ Haldo) By making both sides competent, he could add another layer of realism.

**Special Effects**: This goes without saying. He's a special effects wizard.

What he won't be able to do:

**Choose actors.**

**Write Script.**

**Use beloved characters.**",Why I think that Michael Bey would be perfect for Star Wars

&amp;#x200B;

A group of 4 normal looking people are walking on a crowded street, with a smartphone-looking device guiding their way. One of them asks ""are you sure we're in the right place?"" and another guy simply nods and keeps walking.

They soon arrive to what looks like a third-world car mechanic shop from the outside, but peering in, they sense something: the place is immaculate, with cars and tools precisely placed where they are supposed to be and what looks like a special project, hidden in the middle of it. This could be it, they say.

They start walking around the shop, looking at all things, but when they get close to this special project, one of them produces a photo that looks strikingly similar to what they're seeing with their own eyes. ""This is where it begins"", one of them says.

One of the 4 guys turns to see two plastic toys on a shelf. There's no doubt: it's R2D2 and BB-8. He grabs them and then the owner approaches and asks the guy what is he doing with those toys and if he can help them all with anything.

They look at the owner and point at his special project in the shop and ask him: ""you're creating something very special there... can you tell us more about it?"". Just when the owner is about to tell them about his attempt to create an AI-driven, fully functional R2 unit from scratch, one of the 4 guys looks outside and see 3 very tall men.

""It's them! Let's get outta here!"", he says to the other 3.

Without missing a beat, all 4 step out of the shop, with the owner looking at them, baffled about the whole situation.

What came afterwards was a 3-car &amp; foot chases around town, with the 4 people split 2-1-1 being followed by the very tall men. Eventually the 4 manage to lose the very tall men and are reunited in a sketchy hotel in a sketchy part of town.

StarWars,"So a popular complaint against TLJ is that Luke’s character was fucked with. And I honestly felt that way at first too as, just like many of you, I grew up with him as my hero and one of my favorite characters ever. However, as I’ve come to appreciate TLJ and the sequels more, I’ve started to change my mind on that. I’ve made posts in here defending Luke before and why I think his characterization made sense in TLJ, but that’s not even what I’m trying to argue here. I think the reason why he was “different” matters a lot more then how he was different. It seemed what Rian was trying to do with Luke was convey themes of failure and owning up to your own mistakes and that the past will always catch up to you. He was trying to show Luke in a way that we could all relate to. Basically, the reason why Luke was conveyed the way he was important to the story and helped showcase some important themes and messages that stuck with me and a lot of other people. So I may never be able to convince someone that Luke was portrayed fairly, but I think the reason why he was portrayed the way he was is important, which I think matters a lot more then how he ended up acted the way he did.

StarWars,"I know that this is a pretty common realization/sentiment, but I just wanted to share my personal moment of realization with it.

I was rewatching the prequels recently and there are two moments that particularly illustrate how the Jedi had become blinded by their own hubris. The first occurs in Episode 1, when Mace Windu and Yoda are discussing the idea that the Sith may have Rosen again and are growing in power. Mace Windy's blind moment of pride is more subtle than the next example, but he States that he does not believe the Sith could have returned without the Jedi being aware of it. This implies that he believes the Jedi are too powerful/observant to have allowed this to slip by them.

Later in Episode 2 when Obi-Wan goes looking for Kamino, he searches the archives and speaks with a archivist about his confusion with the missing system and his belief that the records are incomplete. Now Obi-Wan has already earned a certain amount of respect and awareness for who he is within the order. But not only does the archivist dismiss the possibility that the records could be incomplete, she gets rather offended by it and states absolutely that ""if there is no record of something within our archives, then it does not exist"". Seeing this scene as a kid I just thought she was supposed to be some snooty librarian stereotype and that was that. But it is a prime example not only of the toxic hubris of the Jedi, but also how their attitudes have led them to stray towards the dark side unwittingly. For ""only a Sith deals in absolutes"", so no matter how outlandish a concept it may be, the archivist should have at least acknowledged the possibility that the archives could be missing some information if she was truly operating by the philosophy of the Jedi.

I know these are pretty popular and notable examples but it just struck me as I was rewatching the movies and fully understanding their significance for myself, how extremely layered and nuanced George Lucas crafted the first 6 episodes to be. It gives me new appreciation for movies that I have loved dearly for years.",The Sith were right about the Jedi in many ways
StarWars,"      The Sequel Trilogy has many flaws, and the two that stick out are how the movies do not flow together as a trilogy as the OT and (sort of) the PT did, and TFA set up many questions, (who is Snoke, Rey’s parents, Luke’s status, among others) and TLJ seemed to have written it all off. Snoke was killed and did not have the role we thought he would in this trilogy, Rey came from nothing, and Luke was in fear after his failure w/ Ben. As much as we all criticized this, following the setups of TFA through the trilogy would have increased the fluidity of the story, yet (in my opinion) left a somewhat stale, similar rendition of the OT. If we take the twists and turns of TLJ and look at them in a positive light, they were trying to push the ST into a new story where there was not an overarching, orchestral villain, a main hero derived from power, and a mentor that had their weaknesses and needed guidance themselves. The third movie would’ve shown Kylo Ren as he faces is actions and must decide where his destiny lies, and Rey, who must  earn her place in the saga. Opinions on what could’ve fixed the ST and whether TLJ or RoS should have differed, and why?

This scene just passed and it got me thinking, would things have changed at all if Anakin joined Windu at first? I personally don’t think so. It seems like Anakin’s fear of losing Padme and anger towards the Jedi and their lack of trust in him would’ve still caused him to turn. I do wonder if he would have had the guts to fight the chancellor in that scene, say if he would’ve been with Mace and the others in that scene. My gut says no, since I think he would still want to save him (Chancellor) to learn the power to save Padme.

Mace not letting Anakin join him wasn’t right, in my opinion. I would’ve been pissed off too. If I were Anakin, I just uncovered a huge secret that could save the galaxy, and I’m told to step aside? Without much thanks? By a man who seemed to have it out for me? I’d be a bit angry too.

But I hate when People say that this movie ""went on and did it's own Thing, by not answering every question set up in the force Awakens"".
Like, thats not how it works. The Last Jedi connects to the force Awakens incredibly well, it answers the some of the biggest questions set up in TFA (Reys parents is a good example) and leave plenty of Mystery for Episode IX.

Where the story of this trilogy becomes uncohesive is TRoS. Now, i like this movie. But it. Is. Flawed.
It feels very reactionary, and decided that instead of being it's own movie, it was going to be both 8 and 9

Leading to a twist that i HATE. Snoke was created by Palpatine. But, this is beyond my point. We could have gotten an Episode IX that answered the questions left behind by The Last Jedi, while still having a fun and enjoyable story, instead of being what we got (albeit still a good movie) People Wouldnt complain, that Rian Johnson just went in his own Direction, and ignored everything else.

As someone who read The Duel of the Fates script, im really sad that we didn't get it, as it followed The Last Jedi's story and ended the trilogy in a really satisfying way. Although it had some errors and plot holes, this is excusable since it was most likely the first draft, as it wasnt to be filmed for another 13 months, so it was to go through some rewrites

StarWars,"Good evening, afternoon and morning folks, 
I am 21 years old and I for as long as I can remember I've loved star wars but recently I question has came to my mind and I don't know if it was ever answered as I was so young when watching episode 3.

Rewatching all the movies now I know in advance Chancellor Palp is Darth Sidious. But when you guys were watching episode 3 for the first time and he reveals himself to be the sith lord was that a massive reveal or did you already know from hints and guesses? 

P.S really sorry if this has been.",To the older audience in particular
StarWars,"There are already so many tie-in promotional things that the game has done to coincide with recent Star Wars releases, and I believe even Dave Filoni worked on either a storyline or some lore within the game.

I believe that since the era the game takes place is so far removed from eras depicted in the films that it wouldn’t be much of a hassle to integrate everything into canon.

Imagine the massive “canonization party” that would be held if the news comes that SWTOR is getting canonized. The game has numerous singleplayer campaigns all packed into one free-to-play game. 

Once people get wind that the stories and characters presented in the game now hold actual canonical weight, I think hoards of fans would flock to it. Not only the MMO but the original two Knights of the Old Republic games as well.

Come on, Disney. You have a fully crafted MMO with the Star Wars brand on it right under your lil mouse nose. You snatch that up, then fund a KOTOR 3 to boot? You will have united the Star Wars fandom in one swift stroke.","It would be in Disney’s best interests to canonize Knights of the Old Republic, specifically through the massively multiplayer online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic."
StarWars,"In *The Clone Wars*, we learn that the Jedi find the available Force sensitive children in the galaxy, then taking the children and raising &amp; training them to become a Jedi themself. My question is, how do you think Palpatine wasn’t discovered? Palpatine is from Naboo, which seems to be 1 of the most powerful and influential planets in the Republic. So it stands to reason the Jedi would know of all the children strong with the Force on this planet. How do you think Palpatine was never discovered and taken by the Jedi as a child and then trained to be 1 himself?",How was Palpatine never discovered by the Jedi as a child and trained to be one?
StarWars,"I know there is a lot of disagreement on whether or not people liked the sequels, but I think everyone can agree they are extremely disjointed and don't mesh well together. The Force Awakens was basically a remake of A New Hope, but it set the stage well for a new trilogy with lots of interesting characters. The Last Jedi (BY ITSELF) was a great movie, but Rian Johnson didn't give two shits about Star Wars lore and he basically threw out a lot of what JJ Abrams set up in The Force Awakens.. he rebooted the reboot. The Rise of Skywalker is a convoluted mess that is impossible to follow without reading the accompanying novel, and it felt like watching literal fan fiction. 

Kathleen Kennedy deserves the blame for all of this. How in the world do you start a new trilogy without adhering to some kind of greater narrative!! Rian Johnson took a lot of shit but the guy had free rein to make his own movie. He made a good movie, but it didn't fit with the larger story. That's not his fault, it's Kennedy's. Then after the controversy that followed, JJ Abrams releases a fan service mess that was just trying to clean up after The Last Jedi. Kennedy is responsible for all of this. She should be guiding the stories, and should have taken greater control over the scripts. The crazy part is she DID step in on Solo and Episode IX by firing the directors because they ""didn't fit the Star Wars brand,"" but I cant for the life of me understand what she was talking about! Colin Treverow's leaked script was so much better the The Rise of Skywalker, and it didn't throw out the good parts of the Last Jedi. It would have felt much more cohesive than what actually came out. 

It's so frustrating because each movie had tons of positives on their own, but none of them fit together. It's like they reset the drawing board after each movie, rather than laying out a plan from the beginning and following it. All of that is 100% Kennedy's fault, and I can't understand why she didn't take more of the backlash. Most of it seemed to fall on the directors, but it isn't their job to ""protect"" Star Wars canon. They are there to make the best move they can; Kennedy should be the one guiding the ship.",Kathleen Kennedy screwed up and she needs to take the blame for the way the Sequels ended up
StarWars,"Somewhere down the road, do you think they'll ever make Star Wars movies that are not canonical to the Skywalker Saga but could be seen as ""What if?"" EU stories that use the original characters ?

Basically, turning Star Wars Legends into a separate film division.   

This could potentially allow fans who did not like the sequel OR prequel trilogies to tell new stories without ruining Disney's established canon.

One idea, of course, is telling a post-ROTJ story with an older Luke but obviously taking the story in a much more different direction.",Would Disney ever create an Expanded Universe film saga? For example...

StarWars,"I'm reading a Tarantino review about how Roger Corman made his movies.
There was always action and romance with a slight social statement.
That's what was missing...well that and amazing editing with picture and sound.
George was an editor by trade and he made editing a prime directive that would make his serial inspired movie better than the rest.
Also, SW was cheesy, it was based on Saturday morning 1930s serials. but it  had a slight social statement. That was what made it great.

The disney trilogy had no social statements and terrible editing.",I think iknow why the Disney sequel didnt really work
StarWars,"Hi.

I just watched solo - a star wars story, and was confused about the make up of the imperial ground army. How did ground forces go from mostly normal people, in a world war 1 kind of battle, to only storm troopers in episode 4? There isn't that much time between them. Then the original trilogy only has stormtroopers (I think) which are all clones, then in the newer trilogy they aren't clones any more, but are still dressed as storm troopers? Why aren't they dressed in normal military attire in the new trilogy?  

Am I missing something? These seem to be major jumps in the composition of the army, that changes at the top probably wouldn't have much of an effect on?

Thanks",Imperial army progression questions
StarWars,"In A New Hope, Luke is called to adventure by chance by a couple of droids. Ben Kenobi seems almost surprised to have been found, almost as if he forgot he was supposed to be watching Luke or something.

Also, in The Force Awakens, Rey pretty much meets Finn by chance. Jakku just happened to be where Lor San Tekka was. Then the force awakened in Rey when Finn stumbles into Niima Outpost one day.

She’s a Palpatine, so the fact that Han Solo’s ship also happpened to be in Jakku as well is so lucky. Ugh, is it convenient writing or just the Force literally controlling events.

StarWars,"On the internet all the time when people talk about sequels they hate on it so much. I am here to convince you that sequels are the best star wars trilogy. Let's talk about the story, because it's the most important aspect of movies (at least I think so). In sequels we met a troubled scavenger - Rey - that cannot find her place in the world until she finds a ressistance droid BB8 and ""ressistance spy"" Finn (or so she thought). Finn himself was a stormtrooper not being able to see his friends suffer so he finally snaps and frees Poe Dameron (that goes missing after that). He doesn't really know who to trust, but he needs to eventually rely on Rey. Together they try to deliver the droid back to ressistance. Before it happens Rey gets captured by Kylo Ren and therefore Finn ""loses"" another important person in his life. At least he finds his old friend Poe. In pursuit of our female scavenger Finn together with Han and Chewbacca fly to the Starkiller Base. They find Rey but then Han that dies in the hands of his son - Ben Solo also known as Kylo Ren. Eventually Finn tries to fight Ben but gets damaged. Now this is a part that people get angry about. Rey with the use of a lightsaber and the force defeats Kylo even tough she didn't ever showcase such abilities. Because of it she is considered a Mary Sue, but she gives people hope. She is really the same as Super Man. She is the daughter of Palpatine and so she deserves such power. Then Starkiller Base gets destroyed and ressistance completes the map to Luke Skywalker. Rey travels to him and the great Jedi Master suposedly isn't behaving like he should. But he behaves exactly like Yoda. He goes into exile when he's needed. He doesn't want to help, but a friend of his tells him that he should do it. He teaches the new Jedi recruit of the ways of the force, even tough there are doubts coming out of this Jedi's past (not really known at this point with Rey). Then this Jedi needs to fly to the rescue of their friends. Exactly the same. He tries to do it to much as it may be visible. Prequels tried to do something new that didn't really succed. Sequels deliver recreation of original trilogy a lot better than ever with fixes to the story of original trilogy and significantly special effects.

TL;DR:
The story is about people who have problems to find their place in the galaxy. It doesn't try to do something new, but it does something like a ""remake"" of the old movies.",Sequels are the best star wars trilogy

This might be a wild theory, but this what I think may happen.",I have a theory on Mandalorian Season 2
StarWars,"So I think the biggest reason for the divide in the fan base with Rey and whether or not she should have to be somebody is because TFA did such a poor job of making its own characters.

From the rehashed planets (Jakku=Tattoine, Starkiller base=Hoth, Takodana=Endor) to a rehashed Cantina to Maz being a pseudo Yoda, the biggest thing they did was set up Rey with all of Anakin and Luke’s attributes.

1. They made her a scavenger and mechanic
2. They made her an excellent pilot
3. They made her have God mode powers with little effort
4. Growing up on a desert planet

You can’t force (pun intended) that many traits into a character based on two HUGE characters in the saga and then say they’re nobody, specifically not in the lineage of those same characters.

Had they simply tweaked her background as far as what type of planet she’s from, give her some other skills than being a mechanic and pilot (perhaps a weapon forger who made her staff?) and set up her parents from the beginning, then I think it would make more sense and distance the assumptions from her being related to Ani/Luke.

Let me state I could care less about the sex or race of the character. I’d love an alien lead but Hollywood insists on human faces being in the forefront.",The few small tweaks Rey needed to fix the main disputes about her...
StarWars,"Something I haven’t seen discussed as much is the drastic difference between the fighting styles of Kylo Ren and the redeemed Ben Solo. Rewatching the KoR battle we see Ben implementing a more fluid ,graceful ,fighting style , opposite to the feral , brutal  blade work of Kylo Ren . I think the difference  is both indicative of the very distinct personas of Ben and Kylo informing their blade work and the idolization of the equally ( if not more so) distinct personalities of the grandfather that inspired him.

    Kylo  Ren’s style of fighting was in my own view ,very reminiscent of Vader but there is a distinction that puts Vader above Ren and . Vader religiously applies powerful strikes filled with savagery , yet it was focus that truly made Vader a dangerous duelist. The Dark One interchangeably employ raged filled barrages and clinical , calculated blade work . Ren due to his erratic nature cannot employ this and so he gets carried away and rages , thus adopting a poor approximation of Vader that lacks in finesse.

  Ben on the other hand, moves similar to a prequel era Jedi, twirling saber and fancy blocks ,fighting as if a weight had lifted off of his shoulders. Solo moved with a fluidity and confidence  that was a delight to watch . It was very Anakin-esque, in the way that he moved ,powerful  in the sense that you could feel the strength of his blows but still containing a grace to temper it.  I just wish we got to see more  

TLDR - Kylo fights similar to Vader and Ben similarly to Anakin

StarWars,"So Anakin is the chosen one who is supposed to return balance to the force. He does this as Darth Vader when he kills Palpatine/Sidious. Kylo Ren and Snoke aren't Sith. Snoke just used the dark side and Kylo Ren uses the dark side and is a Knight of Ren. But in The Rise of Skywalker (this isn't just another thread hating on The Rise of Skywalker) when Palpatine returns, that basically breaks the prophecy that Anakin, the chosen one, kills the Sith. So could it be that Rey is also part of that prophecy? Or should the Palpatine part of TROS be different?",The chosen one prophecy discussion
StarWars,Sorry if someone already posted something similar but I haven’t seen it. With that said here I go.... Once you hit 50 you’ve been around the block a few times regardless of your species. Let’s say “The child” is an evil sith lord who is playing one big mind trick on the Mandalorian? I keep thinking back to the first episode where Ig-11 was going to kill “The Child”. As far as I know you can’t do a mind trick to a droid. That’s why I believe he did a similar trick to the Mandalorian. Instead of waving his hand “The Child “ used his baby cute looks!

StarWars,"I just got the new art book today and it's beautiful, like the ones before it. However, it feels like it's missing a lot. There's absolutely no artwork on Exegol and it feels out of order? Does anyone have any insight into this?  


I have the book by the same author for ""The Last Jedi"" and it ends with a very detailed description of the fight on Crait (minus the Luke standoff), ending with concept art for Luke levitating on the rock and finally with broom boy.  


In this book, they spend quite a bit of time on the ""Oracle"" who lives on a cooled off Mustafar. But there's not a single mention or concept of Palpatine, his throne, or the Sith chamber on Exagol. It just feels odd that they'd suddenly become concerned about spoilers--if that was the reason why--when they revealed Palpatine in April last year, well before the film was even out.  


You'd think they'd have enough time to pull together some concept art for the final battle of the Saga films? And the evolution of Palpatine's throne room seems like it would be a pretty big deal. To be fair, there are a few shots of a space battle with Star Destroyers and some shots of horses riding on them. But the whole ending just feels very light. I had assumed they waited until March 31st to release it so it could be more comprehensive.  


Anyone have any thoughts or notice this? Other than the above, there's some gorgeous artwork and great insights into the development of the story and art design.",The Art of Rise of Skywalker : No Exegol/Final Battle?
StarWars,"God fucking damn, I've read lots about what people thought about it, but now that i've seen it, its so fucking bad.

They could have just let Palpatine and Kylo Ren win whatever the fuck they were doing with the Sith and save Kylo Ren as Emperor for the next trilogy. Wasted an amazing actor for an amazing character who undoubtedly carried the whole trilogy.

I don't know if I'm in the majority, but I didn't care for most of the characters, Rey, Poe, Finn..

And for all the ""expect the unexpected"" shit everyone working on the movie kept saying, literally everyone knew what would happen long before the movie came out.

Also, did anyone feel like the sound or cgi for the lightsaber battles was off and different from the previous 2 movies?","Just saw Rise of Skywalker, honestly it's by far the worst SW movie to date."
StarWars,"I posted this once when the Blu-ray came out, paraphrasing the quote, but here's the exact quote from the featurette.

“In the first trilogy, the hardest thing Luke could be told in that moment was that Vader was his father. It turns everything on its head for Luke, it takes away all the easy answers and make him face the hardest thing, which is that ‘I no longer have just a bad guy I can hate; suddenly the thing that I thought was the bad guy’s actually a part of me.’ For Rey, I think it's the exact opposite. If she were told that she's related to this person or Luke is her this or whatever, that would be the easiest thing she could hear, that’s everything she wants, that would instantly define what her place is in this universe. So to me, the equivalent of ‘I am your father’ is ‘Nope you gotta stand on your own two feet, there are not going to be those easy answers here for you. You're wondering who you are? Okay, well you have to find out who you are for yourself.’”

Watching this featurette back in 2018, it really set into my mind the brilliance of Rey being a nobody. In all fairness though, finding out Palpatine is your grandpa isn't an easy answer, but as far as a story line goes I think Rian had it right. After a trilogy of Luke being born into this family and being the only one who could save Darth Vader, and a trilogy of Anakin being the Chosen One, I was very excited to have the antagonist be predestined into an inclination for the Dark Side while the protagonist made their own path. I will always mourn the loss of Rian's greatest contribution to the sequel trilogy.",Rian Johnson’s take on the importance of Rey being a nobody
StarWars,"Lately, the Star Wars movies have been, to put it mildly, a bit uninspired. Rebels vs Empire, Jedi vs Sith, occasionally a Death Star thrown in the mix, often with classic OT characters in major roles. (That's not to say they're all bad... They're just not really treading new ground for the franchise.) And a lot of fan suggestions tend to follow the same patterns, with the addition of Legends adaptions thrown into the mix.

With that in mind, I wanted to hear the community's most creative and outside-the-box ideas for Star Wars films.

A couple examples of my own:

**The Elderblade**  
The Jedi believed that every Kyber Crystal was alive. Some more than others. Long ago, a Jedi Master sought eternal life and stored his consciousness within a crystal. A young man who is strong in the Force but undisciplined finds himself drawn to a mysterious relic. A lightsaber from ages past. Through this saber, the ancient being within can guide its wielder, and the wielder can even channel the skills and abilities of the crystal within as if they were their own. But there are others who seek the Blade as well, who will stop at nothing to obtain its powers. And as the boy channels more of the Jedi's abilities, he begins to question who is really in control, and if the master within has an agenda of his own.

**The Droidmaker's Daughter**  
The Force flows through all living things. After the Clone Wars, droids were hated and reviled through much of the Galaxy. The Empire forbid advancements in droid technology, and the New Republic carried over many of these restrictions. But not everyone shares these prejudices. A lonely Droidmaker lives within the far reaches of the Outer Rim, far away from the rest of the Galaxy, with only his Droids to keep him company, conducting experiments that many would consider unnatural. However, his Droids are no substitute for actual human contact, and he wants nothing more than to have a child of his own. Defying every law and regulation, the Droidmaker creates his greatest masterpiece. A daughter crafted of metal on the inside, but appearing human on the outside, who can learn and grow as a person. And even, most frighteningly, access the Force itself. A true living Droid. But when word of her father's experiments reaches the world beyond, she has to run and hide within a galaxy that would hate and fear her if it knew what she really was. A galaxy which her very existence could forever alter.",What are your most outside-the-box Star Wars movie pitches?
StarWars,"Jedis are supposed to be special because the force lets them slow their perception of time right? That’s why they can fight the way they do and why non jedis are generally not a threat to them unless in great numbers.

But you have this random guy who can’t use the force but is able to kill several jedis in duels. I don’t think him having multiple arms/sabers has anything to do with it because 1) he didn’t start out with 4 lightsabers he started with 1 and got more as he killed more Jedi and 2) I don’t see how a four limbed enemy would make much of a difference to Jedi who can deflect laser blasts coming from all directions with seemingly no trouble unless they are caught off guard (like during order 66).",How was General Grievous able to duel and win against jedis?
StarWars,"So I watched TLJ again the other day. Afterwards I realized that the lesson he learned in ROTJ is the same as in tlj. So Luke realizes that he should not follow the Jedi code 100%, and that’s how he was able to redeem his father. He was going to rebuild a new Jedi order. In tlj, he abandons his attachment to Kyle for a split second, and has a fleeting thought of killing him. This obviously was a mistake, but he already learned not to do that. If you say that he was letting his fear guide him instead, then he just forgot his training for no reason. By the end he thinks someone should rebuild the Jedi order, even thought that’s what he was already supposed to do!? Am I looking at this wrong?",Why does Luke learn the same lesson twice?
StarWars,"I would definitely say yes. Andy Circus brought so much to the character, and I think he would’ve made an awesome main villain for the trilogy.

Ian McDiarmid stole the show every time he was on screen, so I was happy to see Palpatine again. The problem was *how* they explained his return and that it wasn’t foreshadowed at all. The only subtle hint I can remember, is in TLJ when I heard Palpatine’s theme at some point. I can’t remember when that was, but I know I heard it.

Snoke could’ve easily been written back into TROS. Maybe cloning force sensitive beings was his discovery, and that’s why he was able to live. It also would’ve made killing him and destroying Exogol way more important. 

**THE NEW PLOT**

Here could’ve been an interesting plot. Snoke wants to create a pair of powerful force sensitive apprentices, but he needs Rey and Kylo on Exegol to do it. To do that, he bridges their minds again so that they come together to destroy him. So the first act is to establish Snoke’s goal on Exegol, and show what Rey and Kylo have been up to and bridge their minds for the first time. 

The second act would be them both hunting for the one Sith Wayfinder at the same time to find Snoke. Rey brings Poe, Finn, Chewie and Threepio to help her. When they find it, the same thing happens then when they fought on the Death Star wreckage. Rey stabs Ben and Leia gives up her life to save Ben Solo. Rey and the rest of her buddies separate, so her and Ben travel to Exegol to face Snoke. 

The third act plays out decently similarly from the movie, except that Rey and Ben go in together and fight off Snoke together. Poe and Finn are tasked with stealing a First Order Dreadnought or one of those planet killing star destroyer things to destroy Exegol with. They win the day, Exegol is destroyed, and Ben and Rey both survive. They split up since the Resistance would probably hang Ben, but they meet up in the future on Tatooine to bury Luke and Leia’s sabers. They stare off into the binary sunset and boom, movie over.

I think this would’ve been way clearer and less disgusting lore-wise than what we got. Rey is still a nobody, but she becomes a Skywalker when she hooks up with Rey. Finn and Poe get something cool to do by stealing a Dreadnought, and we don’t have to bring back any dead characters besides Snoke.",Could Snoke have been the main villain of TROS instead of Palpatine?
StarWars,"So I'm almost finished with ROTS novelization and honestly, it's an amazing book. Never read another Star Wars book (since I was like, 10, anyways) and it was phenomenal. However, I just finished the end of the Obi-Wan/Anakin &amp; Yoda/Sidious fights, and goodness those were some of the shortest, most rushed through fights I've read through in a book. Especially when compared to the opening fight with Dooku - am I missing something? Is there some nuance I am failing to get?

StarWars,"There's been a lot said about this scene but the most prevalent from one side seems to be that because Luke already 'had' his character development in ROTJ by saving Vader, and that's negated and inconsistent with his actions in TLJ in trying to kill Kylo. 

I always from day one interpreted it as even peak Luke as a Jedi Master, having experienced his trials and tribulations in the OT and more, was shaken to the core by what he saw in Ben - enough so that the only rational ultimatum was to kill him. He even states that the darkness growing in Ben was no match for him which justifies his lapse in judgement and blatant panic. A mistake that was momentous enough for him to self-impose himself until he was found by Rey. Was that not the case?",Question on the Luke's attempt on Kylo/Ben in TLJ

StarWars,"CG have clearly caised a massive disruption in the community with these Galactic Legends. They hyped up a pathetic event that brought us stupidly powerful characters that undermined every team in the game. Not only does it put our commitment down the drain, but its ultimately shown that they've wasted their time and money on all the other characters and teams!

Aside from this, very few people were fussed about getting a GL Rey and Kylo. It is sadly sort of protocal for a gane like SWGOH to realease content on the new movies. Yet, they don't seem to want to release content on the new TV shows. The Mandalorian for example has been extremely successful and came out way before TROS. They would have made a truck load of money from the community because everyone loves the mandalorian and probably would have gaimed a little more respect from the community. Instead, they released unwanted content that proved nothing else exclet the fact that they do not listen to their community and are frankly incredibly lazy.

I remember there being a lot of ads for Lego Star Wars 3 on billboards and different places throughout the game. I don't remember a whole lot about it, but there was a ""PVP"" element to it. Two teams, red and blue, would be chosen and you would have to fight other player to get brick from them. You would then navigate up to the top of a tower with your brick and place it on a flag thingy. The first team to build the flag on top of their base would win.

StarWars,"I’ve always been confused at the sentiment on Reddit and in the Star Wars fandom in general. Where it tries to portray the Jedi Order as the “bad guys” and “the reason why Anakin fell”. 

If anything, they were right, and Anakin not following their teachings is the reason why he even fell to the Dark Side. 

Contrary to popular opinion, the Jedi do NOT force you to suppress your emotions. They merely teach you to control them. You can laugh, be sad, be happy and even form attachments. 

The original Jedi Code is this, and is taught to younglings. 

&gt;Emotion, yet peace.

&gt;Ignorance, yet knowledge.

&gt;Passion, yet serenity.

&gt;Chaos, yet harmony.

&gt;Death, yet the Force.

Portraying Jedi as emotion suppressing virgins is just plain wrong and ignorant. 

Now let’s get into the topic of love. 

The Jedi Order forbids attachment and possession, the reason they do this is quite reasonable.

If you’re a Jedi, and your wife and children get kidnapped and murdered by a Sith Lord. You will obviously be filled with rage, for a trained Force Sensitive, rage means the Dark Side. 

In the context of the Star Wars Universe, the Dark Side is always **BAD**. It turns you into a power hungry psychopath and must be resisted at all costs. 

So what happened when the ONE Jedi who decided not to follow the code? He became one of, if not the most evil men to ever exist. Darth Vader. 

The portrayal of the Jedi Order as bad is plain ignorant, and most importantly **wrong** in my humble opinion. 

They have served the Galaxy well, and have kept peace for over a thousand years before Palpatine took over.","Unpopular Opinion: The Jedi Order were right, and are the greatest thing to ever happen to the Galaxy."

To me he was the only person who actually tried to push Star Wars in a forward direction instead of clinging desperately to the past and nostalgia. In my opinion one of the best scenes from the entire trilogy was at the end of TLJ when Kylo Ren said ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It's the only way to become who you were meant to be."" I believe he was being kinda meta as well about the Star Wars franchise as a whole. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I believe The Last Jedi was the only movie to actually use some of the ideas George Lucas (or Lucasfilms) originally had for a sequel trilogy before Lucasfilms was bought by Disney. I'm not saying The Last Jedi isn't without it's flaws but honestly it's the only movie of the sequel trilogy that I'll be rewatching anymore.

I use to think the three were Sidious, Dooku, and Maul but found out Dooku wasnt under palpatine until sometime between episode 1 and 2.

Anyways, can there be technically more than 2 with at a time and the rule of two just means 2 sith lords? Because in episode 6, which the rule of two was most likely not around at the time, Palpatine was trying to get Luke to become his new apprentice, would that have ment Palpatine would've killed Vader or simply kept them both would he have succeeded?

StarWars,"1: His fighting style. While Palpy wanted to corrupt Anakin to replace Dooku, Dooku wanted Obi-Wan as his own apprentice. As to why? Dooku, as seen in TCW when he ridicules Savage and in the mini-series with Grievous, prefers refinement, control and precision over raw ability since he's a master of form 2. Which means Anakin was not the ideal apprentice for him as we see his dueling abilities are very good but still sloppy. Dooku would prefer Kenobi, who mastered the MOST controlled fighting style. In RotS, most people say Anakin should have won, but someone like Dooku looks at it and says, ""Of course Kenobi won, he was fighting smart while Skywalker was sloppy and out of control.""

2: How their fighting styles compared to Palpy's. I think Palpy was a master or form 6, which is weak against 2, the style Dooku used. Kenobi used form 3, which is strong against every form. Compare that to Maul and Savage, who both use 7, which is weak against 6. Maul and Savage obviously lost, but did respectably. Kenobi and Dooku together might have stood a better chance than them and maybe better than Anakin and Dooku.

3: His ability. I've already says Dooku prefers refinement over raw strength. But Kenobi has both, and Dooku knows he chopped Maul in half. At that point he'd heard of Anakin, but he'd never chopped a Sith in half.

4: Okay, this actually does have something to do with Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon wasn't as straight-edged as other Jedi, and Kenobi was his apprentice, so it would be safe to assume Kenobi was the same (the assumption was mostly incorrect, but it was a safe guess)",The four real reasons Dooku wanted Kenobi as his apprentice (And it wasn't because of Qui-Gon)
StarWars,"Different people like different things, I get that. That's life, you know, some people like the Sequels, others are wrong (it's a joke!). But when it comes to Thrawn, there seems to be almost universal appreciation on this sub!

So, being the SW fan that I am, I rushed to my local library to pick the first Thrawn novel up, and I HATED it. I'm probably (almost definitely) overreacting, but I really didn't like it at all. I forced my self just over halfway through, before I had to put it down, because I couldn't stand Thrawn as a character anymore.

He knows everything, he sees everything, he is smarter than everybody, better than everybody at everything. In fact, I cared more about Arihnda's story line than that of our oh so beloved Chiss, because at least she had some conflict. But Thrawn, not so much.

""Oh, I can see that these Fighters are flying slightly weirdly sometimes, therefore they must be controlled from the ground."" Like, what? Where did that even come from?

""Culoss sounds similar to Q-less, therefore they must be members of this specific 'cult' of criminals."" That makes no sense at all!

""I will fight this self-defense-instructor in this unique fighting style, which I of course know, so I can silently obtain information just by looking at how the others react."" Come on now.

Admittedly, I am rambling at this point. And I will say, the writing style of Timothy Zahn was fine. It is the person Thrawn that I dislike so much.

And so, looking at other peoples posts on here makes it pretty obvious that I am just not getting it, which brings me back to my title-question.

StarWars,"Like most of us, I've loved Star Wars since I was a kid. Some people don't like where it's heading, some people do. Personally, I love every bit of Star Wars out there. But that's not really the point. Star Wars is like a lifeline for me. Every bit of trauma I've gone through, it's given some sort of solace. Some light to turn to. 

A couple of years ago I lost my girlfriend suddenly and unexpectedly. In my most grief riddled moments I turned to the galaxy far, far away. I was watching one movie or another. 

I met my current girlfriend about 6 months after that loss. I, more or less, introduced her to the wide array of Star Wars. Before we started dating she said she wanted to watch the prequels but we spent all night talking while The Phantom Menace was in the background. We've seen every film since then, and The Mandalorian. We've seen every film since The Last Jedi opening night. 

The Earth is in a rough place right now. I'm trying to stay strong but it's hard. All in all... I'm real scared. My girlfriend already has anxiety and infrequent panic attacks so I'm doing my best to put on a brave face for her. Luckily, we're both still employed. 

Unluckily, only she can work from home. I have a weird schedule. After Monday, I'm off until Thursday, and then have Friday Saturday and Sunday off. But after that I'm on the clock for roughly 8 days. I call these days my long stretch. 

On my three days off I'm very much looking forward to binging every movie out so far. It gives me something to look forward to.

StarWars,"-Both Finn and Rey are the main characters of this trilogy. Both end up being force sensitive and leave to train with Luke.

-There is a role switch in the Resistance/FO struggle. The New Republic is the main governing power of the galaxy. The First Order is an Imperial splinter that had been secretly building itself post Battle of Jakku and is the rebellion/lesser power here.

-Kylo Ren is lured to the Dark Side by Snoke because he knew of what a great hero his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, was to the Republic, and grows ever more impatient with his Jedi training. Snoke tells him of his fall and the power he gained as Vader. Ren destroys Luke’s new Jedi Order, and Luke leaves.

-The First Order name comes from a failsafe plan made by Palpatine in the case of his death contained in a holographic message. The first one alludes to more messages being hidden across the galaxy.

-Snoke is Galen Marekk. The character is mostly the same, but TFU is retconned. Marekk views his former master, Vader, as weak after finding out about his turn to the Light, and Palpatine’s failure to prevent his own death. Marekk wants to rebuild the Sith order in his own image, as he sees himself as the only Sith who wasn’t their own downfall.

-Luke doesn’t isolate himself or cut himself off from the force. He goes off in search of other Jedi and Sith texts/artifacts to better understand the Force and to build a new order of Force Sensitives. He uses a map contained in an old holocron and, after copying it’s contents, entrusts it with R2 in case anyone of his friends needs to find him.",I want to re-write the sequel trilogy with more or less the same set pieces.

StarWars,"This is basically how I pictured the Force Unleashed would go down in the new Disney timeline. 

The events more or less happen the same, but with a few adjustments for the new canon timeline. 

We open on Darth Vader arriving on Kashyyk hunting down a rogue Jedi master who’s rumored to be hiding a group of padawans who survived Order 66. He locates the master and kills them, and finds the padawans, all around fifteen years old. Among them was a padawan with shaggy black hair named Galen Marek. 

Vader took the children and inducted them into the inquisitor program for five years. Their job was the hunt down and kill any Jedi they locate. Galen was placed as the First Brother of the Inquisitors. He’s also referred to as “Starkiller”. 

Each of the new inquisitors gets their own training droid, and Galen’s is known as Proxy, a droid who short-circuited and developed the personality of a cheerful sociopath whose prime directive is to kill him. 

Galen is assigned to a young pilot named Juno Eclipse, who will be flying him and his men to their missions. 

The rest of the story follows relatively similarly to the original: 

*Galen hunts down Rahm Kota

*Galen hunts down Kazdan Paratus

*Galen hunts down Shaak Ti

*Vader fakes Galen’s death in order to trick the Emperor into thinking he’s dead

*Vader orders Galen to start a rebellion in order to destabilize the Empire just enough so that he could kill the Emperor

*Galen rescues Juno, then grabs Proxy and they all head out on the Rogue Shadow

*They find Rahm Kota on Nar Shaddaa

*They travel to Kashyyk to free the Wookiee’s and convince Bail Organa, and his daughter Leia, to join the Rebellion. Galen is forced to kill one of his fellow inquisitors, though, and it destroys him to do so. 

*They travel to Felucia to rescue Mon Montha from Marris Brood

*Galen meets with Vader again, and he is told to destroy a Star Destroyer construction facility on Raxus Prime

*Juno overhears this and accuses Galen of being loyal to Vader

*They travel to Raxus Prime to destroy a Star Destroyer construction facility. Proxy now tries to kill Galen by taking Darth Maul’s form. 

*Galen defeats Proxy and destroys be facility, but be doesn’t pull a Star Destroyer out of the sky

*Organa meets with Mon Montha and a few other senators on Corellia in order to officially start the rebellion. Vader kidnaps al of them, and reveals to Galen that this was all a front to lure out the Empire’s enemies. 

*Vader tries to kill Galen, but Proxy sacrifices himself to save him. 

*Galen and Juno track Vader and the senators to the Death Star, and he kills his way through the space station, killing a few of his fellow inquisitors in the process

*Galen finally faces Vader and after a long duel defeats him, then he meets the Emperor. 

Galen and Kota work together to beat the Emperor while the others escape. Kota escapes too, but Galen stays behind. A massive force lightning explosion happens, and Galen is nearly killed. 

On Kashyyk, the senators all agree to found the rebellion. 

Meanwhile, Vader and Sidious both repair Galen as best as they can and make him into their own personal assassin, similar to Ventress. However, the suit he wears is as painful as Vader’s, with the suit forcing him to breathe instead of allowing him to do so.
