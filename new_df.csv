StarWars,"Full disclosure - I'm not fully aware of all the OT lore in the comics/canon books. After seeing the Clone Wars finale and knowing that Ahsoka was alive past ROTJ - is it possible that she met with and helped train Luke between ESB and ROTJ?

Luke levels up quite a bit between those movies and I don't think he is trained by Yoda during that time (unless there is some other non-film canon explanation for how he gets so much better with the force.)

It would be sweet to see them interact somehow, or with some of the other OT/ST characters. Can't wait to see what they do with her in live action.",Theory: Does Ahsoka help train Luke?

StarWars,"Post contains spoilers for Star Wars Rebels and Clone Wars!


I've been seeing a lot of hate towards rebels recently, specifically the art, however, there are others commenting on the ""trash plot"", ""dull characters"" and a range of other criticism which I personally feel the show doesn't deserve.

Rebels is still Star Wars and it's a great piece of canon that really helps show what the empires reign was like in the early years. It is packed with exciting moments that are arguably more memorable than a lot of the memorable moments in the clone wars (with exception of season 7), such as Ahsoka vs Vader or Ezra and Thrawn disappearing into the outer rim somewhere and especially the development and final moments of Maul. 

Rebels art style isn't even that bad, it's just not as good as the clone wars. The only major flaws in the artwork was Yoda, Hondo, Anakin and Bo, Everything else was fine if not good. Rebels was our first ""Canon"" introduction to how brutal Vader was in the time between ROTS and a new hope, yes there was filler but what show doesn't have filler in it. The filler isn't even that bad because it further explores the star wars universe or introduces new characters.

The hate that Rebels is getting is unjustified in my opinion and it is potentially putting off people who haven't seen it. It is still prequel era and holds a lot of emotional weight for fans of the prequels or the clone wars as well as further develops much loved characters and shows hints of the true powers of Vader and Palpatine.",Rebels is still a good show despite its faults.
StarWars,"I once had a friend claim that Maul is just as evil, if not, MORE evil than old Sheev. I pondered that notion, but had to disagree. Here's why:

Maul knew nothing besides violence and bloodshed from the day he was born. He grew up on the ruthless planet of Dathomir, and was recruited by Sidious at a young age. The ways of the Sith melded naturally with the warrior ways of male Dathomirian tribes. He never really had a chance to be anything but a killing machine. He grew to tfavor the Dark Side because it granted him the ability to reach the top of any hierarchy he desired, crowning him as the alpha among all of his peers.

Contrarily, Sidious was raised in a Royal family on the peaceful planet of Naboo. He was naturally drawn to positions of power, and sought out knowledge of the mythical Sith. He initially wasn't influenced by any outside force. He just thirsted for power. He wanted to sculpt the galaxy how he saw fit. Darth Plagueis discovered him because of his immense Force sensitivity and proclivity towards the Dark Side. When Palpatine trained under him, his ambition was unmatched. He didn't ever feel discouraged by his failures; he used them to fuel his anger. This is why the Dark Side came so naturally to him. He hated anyone who stood in his way to absolute power, and viewed everyone else as pawns; including Plagueis. He even slaughtered his entire family in a fit of rage. He was a legitimate psychopath, relishing in manipulating others and seeing his schemes come to fruition. More potent than his strength in the Force, was his ability to speak. This is how he was able to rise to power so quickly in the Republic. There was nobody he couldn't manipulate. This gift of deception is what gave him such a massive edge over past Sith. He was a mastermind. No other Dark Sider was able to infiltrate and hijack the central government of the galaxy. Furthermore, he purposefully ruined the lives of trillions of people to further his own agendas, inuding Anakin Skywalker.

Even Maul didn't feel the need to take over the entire galaxy. He was content with ruling the Outer Rim through his crime syndicates. Maul also valued family, as seen with his alliance with Savage Opress. Not only that, he seemed to even actually have _some_ respect for the Mandalorians, and the cultural similarities they had to his own people. Maul was a warrior, and Sidious was a politician. The former used violence to achieve their ends, while while the latter used deception.

I'm getting into The Clone Wars for the first time, now that it has ended and has so good critic. I know mostly everything that happens, but I'd like to experience the best moments of the show. So far I've watched a few episodes of the first season.  


I'm not particularly interested in small ""side quest"" stuff, of the type ""Ashoka learns a lesson"", and I completely love the army and politics side of the conflict, also the big plot developments (Darth Maul in Mandalore i.e.) Given that... Would you recommend me to watch all of the series? Or just handpick a few chapters? I'm guessing that seasons 5-7 are to be watched in full, but I'm clueless on where to start, what to omit, etc. Help appreciated.

StarWars,"Just a fun thread but if you could make a full length movie trilogy out of Clone Wars arcs which ones would you use? You can either draw out existing arcs or combine some to make one movie. It could also be a fun way to introduce people to Clone Wars that don't have time forna 7 season show but I digress.

I'm watching the show for the first time right now and I just got to the Mortis arc and I couldn't stop thinking about how this arc plus the Nightsisters arc would make for a fantastic 2nd movie in the trilogy. Maybe end it with Dookus attack on the Nightsisters and Savage finding Maul (both season 4) and that would be awesome. Maybe the first movie could end with the the Obi Wan season 2 Mandalorian arc to set up Deathwatch for the final movie and Anakin could be doing either the Senate Hostage Crisis or the Zillo Beast?

It would have been hard to add anything too great to the OT bc of technology issues.

If they started cloning just after the end of the clone wars (ended in 19 BBY) There would be a 29 year gap, it’s easy to imagine tha the kaminoans needed some time to get their organisation back and running.

StarWars,"

With the finale of the clone wars it’s easy to assume that darth mauls story moves on to rebels where he perished. I think there is at least one more major event for him, here is why.
Order 66 happened on 19 bby, that is when maul was last seen escaping the republic ship

Maul died on 2 bby in the twin suns episode of rebels. This gives us a seventeen year time span to work with.

 In the movie solo he told Qi’ra to come to Dathomir where they will work closer together, this was after he gave her all of Dridons stuff in the crimson dawn so it is likely that other crime syndicates are going there too. Solo was estimated to take place on 10-13 bby leaving us with 7-9 years left on mauls life left. 

Maul was likely planning something big including his crime syndicates however in rebels he was working seemingly alone to activate the sith super weapon ( correct me if wrong only read the wiki about it ). So what happened with the crime syndicates? If he did use them he would have brought mercenaries or bounty hunters

Instead I think his access to the crime syndicates were severed or someone took over ( Qi’ra story? ) this leaves a lot of possibilities for possible Darth Maul stories to tell.

StarWars,"Listening to Filoni talk about how he always had the finale in his head over the years since it was cancelled, to me means that it was pitched to Kennedy long before a decision to make rebels was made. 

So she was totally wrong not to finish TCW first. The finale was brilliant. 

Rebels could have received a much better promo stage leading up to its release.

Just a thought. But how can you leave Kennedy in charge when she definitely knew what the last season of TCW was going to be and shelved it. 

Who in there right mind would decide not to make filonis pitch? 

Filoni has done great but I bet he was a tiny bit upset he had to do rebels first. Which means maybe rebels could have been even better,imo, just bc Filoni was probably a bit disgruntled right around the time she shelved his baby.

StarWars,"Hey, this is just an idea that came up to me yesterday about a different way Revenge of the Sith could have went and I wanted to share...

Anakin would train to be a Jedi Knight by Obi-Wan, therefore honoring Qui-gon's request. He would become a great warrior and known as a hero in the clone wars, although hotheaded. He would be assigned Ahsoka, to be his padawan, and she would grow strong and kind. Maul would still be spared by Sidious. Anakin would grow a friendly relationship with the Chancellor, seeing him as a mentor. 

Here where some changes would happen: Anakin would not have felt in love with Padmé right away, although they would have a thing for each other. So most of Anakin's love was to his Padawan. When she was expelled and then pardoned by the Jedi Council, her decision not to return to the Jedi Order would break Anakin's hearth. 

When the battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan against Dooku happens, the Jedi capture the Count with the help of Master Yoda. Dooku is imprisoned and questioned to reveal the identity of the Sith Master. 

Sidious is tremendously worried about the capture of Dooku, since he knew that the Count will reveal his identity, but Sidious would need help killing the Count, since his death would put the Jedi Council in high alarm, making them know that the enemy was very close and further making the Jedi suspect him. So he cames up with a plan.

Sidious gets to Maul in Mandelore, gives him the locations of Ahsoka (he has spies tracking her), and haves her poised by Maul. Maul obeys, and after a fight with Ahsoka, she is poisoned.

After hearing the news that Ahsoka was found  misteriously ill and in danger of dying,  Anakin feels powerless and guilty for not being able to help her. When he tell this to the Chancellor, he reveals himself to Anakin as Darth Sidious, and promisses that if he joins him, they could save Ahsoka together, with the power of the Dark Side. Anakin agrees and pledges himself to Sidious and the Sith orders Anakin to kill Count Dooku, and prepares to command order 66. 

At the same time, the Siege of Mandalore is happening, leaded by Bo-Katan, who asked the Jedi order for help, and was rejected. Only Obi-Wan comes to her aid secretly and against orders (a very Anakin thing to do), for wanting to end Maul for good and revenge Dutchess Satine. Obi-Wan kills Maul, and I'm his last breath, he tells that Skywalker is the key to all this, and he was forced to play his part with the poisoning of Ahsoka, starting the grand plan of the Sith. As Mauls still wants revenge against his old Master, he even tells what is the antidote to Ahsoka's poison. 

Anakin kills Dooku and Order 66 happens, killing most of the Jedi. Darth Sidious personally kills the Jedi Masters at the Council to show Anakin the power of the Dark Side, and fights Master Windu.

Basically only Obi-Wan and Yoda, since Obi-Wan wasn't with clones and Yoda felt it, escaped and went to Coruscant. Obi-Wan was on his way to Coruscant too, to tell Anakin's of his findings and report Mauls death. 

After the landing of Obi-Wan in Coruscant, he finds about order 66 when the clones try to kill him, so he fights and sneaks to he Jedi Council to find the Chancellor killing Mace Windu and Anakin watching. Sidious orders Anakin to kill Obi-Wan, turning him in a true Sith. Anakin and Obi-Wan start fighting, and Obi-Wan tells that Maul was who poisoned Ashoka and he knows the antidote. Sidious says he's lying, but Anakin believes his Master, and after connecting 1+1, understands that's the poisoning was ordered by Sidious himself. Obi-Wan and Anakin fight together against Sidious, but when he was getting the upper hand, Yoda shows up and helps them defeat the Sith, but dies of his injuries. 

They cure Ahsoka and flee from Coruscant together, with the entire clone army looking for them.

General Greivous takes control of the clone army (image Greivous way more like in the Tartakovsky series). The 3 Jedi make a final push against Greivous, since they had located his base in Utupai prior to order 66 and Yoda told them the location. They engage Greivous and manage to defeat him, at the cost of the sacrifice of Obi-Wan' life to save Anakin. 

Anakin (who later would marry Padmé) and Ahsoka then become the faces and leaders of the Resistance, who fight to free the Universe from an old Sith legend who used the disturbances in the force to rise again and take control of the Clones... A Sith legend shrouded in mystery and tragedy...",Alternative ending to Revenge of the Sith
StarWars,"I really enjoy the clone episodes in TCW, but a friend of mine recently brought up a good point. In AOTC, they are described as “completely obedient, accepting any order without question.” Yet, this isn’t what we see in the show. Especially in the Umbara arc, the clones are questioning Krell’s orders. Heck, we even have a traitor and a deserter in the show. How does this line up with what we heard from Lama Su? 

I’d like an in universe answer if possible, I understand it makes for a much more interesting show when you have the clones this way.",Why were the clones in The Clone Wars not as obedient as they were described in Attack of the Clones?
StarWars,"So I just finished the Mandalorian and I’ve watched TCW and most of Rebels, both of which have lots of Mandalore and Mandalorians. The first thing is that Don Djarin says that he cannot remove his helmet but in the two aforementioned shows pretty much any Mandalorian you see is seen without their helmet on. As for the second point, in Rebels S4 Sabine says that her armour is 500 years old and has only been painted and slightly reforged so why is it that in the Mandalorian, Din replaces any piece of armour, excluding the helmet, like it’s no big deal.

While these are only small points it does annoy me as under Disney it feels like that there is no definite explanation for things as the new films and shows have basically retconned certain things and ideas that happened pre-Disney.",Why has ‘the Mandalorian’ rewritten some Mandalorian lore?
StarWars,"Before I start, I bet lots of people have said things before that I’ll bring up in this post, but coming off of may the 4th I decided to write a post about Star Wars. 


I was born in 2005. I never got to experience Lucas’ movies in theaters, but my parents were huge fans of Star Wars. My mom said she was just waiting for me to be old enough to watch Star Wars for the first time. When I turned three, she decided I was ready. She popped in the 1995 vcr version of a new hope, and I was hooked. Over the next couple of days, three year old me had finished all of the movies, and after that I watched at least one of the movies a day, according to my parents. 

Lucky for me, the clone wars movie was coming out in a couple months. It was one of the first movies I watched all the way through in theaters. I would watch the clone wars episodes when it came out, I had tons of action figures, all I talked about was Star Wars. 

For the past 12 years of my life, I have always loved Star Wars. I have been introduced to other things, like Harry Potter, hunger games, and more, but even then I still gravitated more to Star Wars. Half of my room is dedicated to only Star Wars related things. 

I recently got to rewatching the entire saga, and there is something about Star Wars that nothing else has. While I can go and talk about the issues with the sequels and the writing of the prequels, when you watch them it’s still Star Wars, and when I watch them I forget about The issues I have with them. 

When I watched the final episode of the clone wars I was filled with sadness that it was over, and I went back and watched revenge of the sith, the movie I have the most connection with since I watched it the most as a kid. As I watched, I felt like a child again. I completely forgot about the troubles I was having in school and with friends, and just was lost in the movie. 

Star Wars is one of the only things I can watch to take my mind off of the things that are happening in my life, and the only thing that’s I will love no matter how cheesy the writing is or how blatant the plot holes are. Thanks to the series that made my childhood.",Why I love Star Wars
StarWars,"I've always been a big fan of Rex, I watched Clone Wars on and off since it began and the last season was incredible. I always knew about the theory he was on Endor but I never knew it was basically confirmed until the other day. 

Filoni said how it could be him but he wouldn't confirm it and just get rid of Nik Sant. There's also the animation that shows Rex on Endor with his gauntlets.

If he shows up in The Mandalorian with Ahsoka then I will lose my mind. He would definitely be old but I've been saying for a while that he's been a soldier all his life so I'd imagine he keeps in as great a shape as possible. 

Also, maybe he finds a way to slow his advanced ageing. I'd love for more of Rex to be explored in books or something!",Rex's story is now one of my favourites
StarWars,"Let me start by saying I absolutely loved this final arc. Dave Filoni is a creative genius and mastermind; I’m so glad that he and everyone involved finally got to give us the finale to possibly the best Star Wars content this century. Everything from the character moments to the story to the animation to Kevin Kiner’s score is nothing short of breathtaking. It was everything I could’ve hoped for and more. 

All of that said, I’ve come to quite a dilemma...

I have owned the *Ahsoka* novel by E. K. Johnson (published 2016 and declared canon) for quite some time. As I’m sure many others who own the novel have noticed, there are many discrepancies between the novel and the Siege of Mandalore arc.

Some things are minor: a few dialogue changes between Anakin/Ahsoka and Maul/Ahsoka (which could easily be explained as “maybe we just didn’t see their whole interaction”), Ahsoka’s sabers being green while on Mandalore (not as easy of an explanation here, but I’m willing it to let it slide), etc. 

Other things, however, are much more impactful in my opinion: the fact the Rex, Wolfe, and Gregor all have their inhibitor chips removed before the Siege, the fact that Order 66 occurs while Ahsoka and Rex are still on Mandalore, the details in capturing Maul, etc. 


Now, I completely understand that retconning happens all the time in media and entertainment. Things are changed and life goes on. However, as someone who cares (or at least used to care) deeply about Star Wars lore and canon, this doesn’t sit quite right with me. Why would Disney blatantly go against their own established canon here?

Of course, the answer is likely that Dave Filoni was not satisfied with what the novel gave us and wanted to show us his version.

This just feels odd to me after months of Disney and the “Story Team” telling us “The Rise of Skywalker novelization has tons of answers in it! Read it! Buy it! It’s 100% canon!” (Obviously I’m not actually quoting someone here, but you get the idea) Is that novel really canon though? Why is that one and not the *Ahsoka* one? Should we believe that canon only matters unless they come up with a better idea and change it?

It’s equally bizarre when you consider a whole new line of “canon” books are on the way about the High Republic... will those just get retconned by a new show too?

Again, I cannot stress enough that I love what happened in the arc. I am in no way trying to criticize Filoni’s work or lessen what he has done. In fact, I am **happy** with the changes - I like what the arc showed better than the novel! As a fan, I’ve just been almost completely dissuaded from caring about canon now if it can just be thrown out of the window with a flick of a finger. 

I mean, at the end of the day, does this really matter? Probably not. It’s just a retcon that has minimal impact as a whole. At the same time, will I continue buying “canon” books to try and learn as much as I can about Star Wars...? Eh, probably not.",Regarding established canon and Ahsoka [SPOILERS]
StarWars,"Outside of comics we haven’t really seen anything like this and it would be a good opportunity to explore Vader’s character immediately after revenge of the sith (outside of comics) while also exploring the transition period of republic to empire from clones to storm troopers which we never get shown a proper transition of. 

Idk but in terms of films/tv series i always felt there was a barrier splitting the two eras apart and i wish something was shown to organically connect the two more properly  ya know? 

Like show when palpatine decided to retire the clones and their reaction idk. 

This could also be a good opportunity to flex Vader’s power like in rogue one since live action vader won’t be held back by technology like he was in the OT.

StarWars,"I think this would be a great idea, especially after The Clone Wars. It could explain why Anakin feels Obi-Wan is too limiting, Obi-Wan stepping up to the role of Mentor and Jedi Knight, especially after Qui-Gon’s death. Obi-Wan probably made some initial mistakes when just becoming a Jedi Knight. It could also revolve around Count Dooku as a Jedi and the reasons for his fall, and show Palpatine’s father figure role and influence on Anakin at a young age. It just feels like a good era for more material.",Why is there not a show about what happened between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones?
StarWars,"I'm very mixed on The Last Jedi. It has higher highs and lower lows than The Force Awakens. For everything I love there's something I hate. But I have never gotten the criticism of the ""Holdo Maneuver"". Keep in mind the only novels I ever read in either continuity are Tarkin and the Aftermath Trilogy. But based on the films and TV shows nothing was contradicted. TFA showed hyperspace jumping involves going into a wormhole. So when I first saw that scene I figured the attack made sense. If you jump too early you go to your destination, too late and you crash into the ship doing minimal damage (as seen in Rogue One), just the right time it becomes a weapon of mass destruction. 

I can't think of many instances where the maneuver would've been useful in the past (I imagine the Death Star had a stronger hull than the Supremacy). Plus Hux's reaction in the film indicates to me this isn't something Holdo invented so the criticism ""why has nobody done this before"" doesn't seem valid.

The real problem is, I don't think he understood what Luke Skywalker meant to people in the real world.

Favourite film: Revenge of the Sith.

-

Overall, the most entertaining Star Wars film for me. We see how much our characters have grown and how their relationshps have evolved. It has comedic moments, great action set pieces and goes to really dark places (Order 66). 

-

Least Favourite: The Last Jedi.

-

This movie was a mess. Slowest chase seen in any movie, useless casino side plot, flying Leia and a regression of Luke's character journey.

-

Favourite Hero: Obi-Wan Kenobi (He just rules). He is the epitomy of what it means to be a Jedi. He defeated Darth Maul, Genreal Grievous and Anakin Skywalker.

-

Favourite Villain

-

Count Dooku. I loved that he never fully delved into the dark side, just for political reasons. It's cool that he was Qui Gon's Master. He was also Yoda's apprentice.

StarWars,"I’m always shocked that there have only been like 1 or 2 Star Wars fighting games and it is really sad. I prefer 2D fighters, but I’d even be fine with a full fledged game based of PS2’s Revenge of the Sith.

There are so many archetypes that would be fun to play with for these characters. Luke would be the all rounder character that has a little bit of everything. Vader would be the brute who could do some serious damage. Obi-Wan would be a strategy character based around techniques and spacing.

I honestly don’t care if it they have lightsabers that don’t rip limbs in one hit, I’m used to fighting games where people throw fireballs at each other and brutally pierce other people’s bodies with no major impact on the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

The end of series 7 of The Clone Wars definitely shows us the Siege of Mandalore, but in The Mandalorian, Moff Gideon also references it:

""*Or perhaps the decommissioned Mandalorian hunter... has heard the songs of the Siege of Mandalore, when gunships outfitted with similar ordnance laid waste to fields of Mandalorian recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.*""

The siege itself doesn't seem to go on for multiple days; the episodes flow pretty quickly from Ahsoka's arrival to the end of the siege and it doesn't seem any more than a day. Seems odd that there should be a singled out incident called ""The Night of a Thousand Tears"" in such a short conflict (unless it's another name for the siege itself?).

I thought there might be another siege post Order 66 in which Concord Dawn is half blown up (as we see it in Rebels), but then I realised I was confusing it with Concordia in Clone Wars...

What are your thoughts/what details am I missing?",Were there two Sieges of Mandalore?
StarWars,"at the beginning of TROS, Kylo gets a Sith Wayfinder from Darth Vader's castle on Mustafarr, there's honestly a problem with Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder, but I'll give my explanation for why Vader had a Sith Wayfinder: 

Vader had a Sith Wayfinder at his castle, meaning he somehow acquired it (Palpatine probably gave it to him to guard it sometime between ROTS and ANH), Vader probably didn't know what it was (Palpatine probably didn't trust Vader with the knowledge of Exegol and his clone body), so he most likely tried to secretly learn more about it (because this would be a so Vader thing to do), eventually learning it's a map and leads to a place called ""Exegol"", Vader would of wonder what his Master was hiding there (he'd know it'd be something important enough for him to not be informed about), so Vader would've followed the coordinates on the Wayfinder to Exegol (to see what his Master had there, cause if it was a powerful weapon, as Vader didn't  fully trust Palpatine at this point), once there, he'd have found Palpatine's cult and Palpatine's clone body, just waiting for Palpatine's soul to eventually go in it, Vader would of quickly realized Palpatine's plan, to send his soul into this clone body when he dies, so he can live longer, Vader would of then left Exegol (not destroying the clone body and killing Palpatine's entire cult, as to make sure Palpatine would never learn he was there) and never tell his Master about him having went to Exegol, and decided to keep his Wayfinder hidden in his castle. 

this is just my explanation on why Vader had a Sith Wayfinder in the first place, now for the problem of Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder; 

Force Ghost Anakin spoke to Luke a lot after ROTJ (and before Luke's exile), so wouldn't have Anakin told Luke about Palpatine's clone body at Exegol and tell him to go to his former castle (when he was Vader) to get the Sith Wayfinder to go kill Palpatine for good this time, or better yet (something related to my explanation), couldn't Anakin just tell Luke where Exegol and let him go finish the job, unless the Sith Wayfinder would actually allow Luke to properly get to Exegol without any problems getting there. 

what do you guys think of any of this though?",the most likely reason with Vader having had a Sith Wayfinder and the problem with him having it.
StarWars,"Ok, so I haven't seen Rise of Skywalker or Mandalorian yet, and I've only watched half of Solo. I've seen Force Awakens a few times and Last Jedi once, but almost two years ago. Trying to figure out the best watch order to kind of recap and see what I haven't yet to get the best lead up to RoS. As much as I'd want to just watch them all again I will be skipping 1-6 this go around. Should I just go straight release order, or not break up the new trilogy with RO and Solo ? Also, should I do Mandalorian 1-7 before RoS, than finish it after?

I know this is asked a lot and I've been looking at a ton of different threads tonight but couldn't find any real discussion on breaking up the new trilogy with RO and Solo as well as watching RoS inbetween episodes 7-8 of Mandalorian. 

Thanks for the input!",Weird dilemma here on a viewing order
StarWars,"I really am interested in creating a dark, deep sequel trilogy, I want to make an alternate trilogy. No details are set at all at the moment I am just jotting ideas down, but i'm looking for a group of 5. Three story creators including me which will discuss everything required to create a 3 part arc, and 2 talented artists who are willing to create amazing concept art work based off whatever we create in the story.

Reply in the comments if this resonates with anyone. No disrespect to anyone but I want people who are dedicated and passionate and know star wars, and understand majority of the extended canon outside the movies.",Alternate sequel story and concept art *My creation
StarWars,"So correct me if this was mentioned or hinted at in the Clone Wars final season and I missed it or the Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir comic (I haven't read it). 

But I've been thinking a lot about the Clone Wars final season, particularly the last arc and how it connects with RotS. During the marketing, a lot of the creators and outlets advertised how it would ""change how we see RotS"" and while, don't get me wrong, The Siege of Mandalore is incredible, arguably the best arc we've got for the show and one of the best pieces of SW content we've received in years, it didn't really change my viewing of RotS. Both pieces of content still felt very distinct from each other and while CW added to the film, that was it. Maul and Ahsoka still felt too distant (and I know they were because they were retroactively put into the series, I just mean diegetically in the universe it still felt that way)

Something as well that's always bothered me about RotS is the opening. The Battle of Corruscant is a great set piece and reintroduction to world, for sure, but when it comes to character motivations, if this was Palpatine's plan why not earlier? Or later? Why at that point? And what was the point of it in the end? Seemed like a very convoluted way to kill off Dooku and...thats it's really. The events that followed lead to the ALMOST death of him by Mace Windu and ALMOST betrayal by Anakin (when he informs Windu of Palpatine being Darth Sidious). It all just seemed very confusing. Until I started looking at it from a certain point of view....

Palpatine has a vision. He sees Mandalore in flames. He sees the fighting between the clones, blue and white coated Mandalorians and hellish red and black ones as well. He sees Maul fighting Anakin and Obi-Wan in the throne room, their lightsabers colliding, and he sees the rage and the determination that Maul fights with. Finally, he sees his future apprentice cut in half by his former. Palpatine awakes from his vision and grows afraid. ""Whatever Maul is going to do cannot come to pass. But how do I stop it?"" He thinks cautiously before scowling. Things need to be fast tracked. Reluctantly, he pulls his hood over his rage filled eyes, retrieving his holoprojector before activating it. In front of him, the blue shimmer of a deformed, metallic being with yellow piercing eyes bows before him. ""What is thy bidding my master?"" He asks with his raspy electronic voice, his words sputtering as he coughs violently. ""The time has come earlier than anticipated, General. It's time you came to Corruscant and payed the Chancellor a visit"" Palpatine replies with a crooked smile. 

I believe Palpatine enacted the Battle of Corruscant, and thus the following events of RotS as a power move against Maul, a reaction to either a vision or intel he had received about Maul's plans. And I love it. It explains so much about RotS in my mind. Why Palpatine played it so close, almost dying and losing his new apprentice. Why he didn't deal with Obi-Wan, Anakin's metaphorical father figure and biggest risk to his upcoming Empire's most powerful figure in the form of Darth Vader. It also makes Maul a key figure and much more integral to the story, rivalling and stirring Palpatine without us even realising. 

My theory is probably wrong or at least a bit far fetched, but I like to think that this was the case. I think it makes RotS so much more exciting, and makes CW so much more important in the overall story of Star Wars. I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you agree/disagree? Why? Either way, I hope I've allowed some of you to think both pieces from a different perspective",Theory: Did Palpatine know that The Siege of Mandalore was going to happen?
StarWars,"When rewatching AotC, I feel that we could have skipped TPM entirely.  Bear with me on the plot.

Episode I:  Qui Gon and Obi Wan are sent by the Jedi to rescue a lost Jedi named Sifo Dias in the outer rim on the planet of Tatooine.  The Jedi stumble upon a young slave boy named Anakin who help them navigate the area.  QuiGon also notices two adult twins (foreshadowing) working as slaves with the boy.  Boy shows talent with the force and QuiGon is keen on freeing him.  Waddo rolls dice and Anakin manipulates it showing he is willing to abuse his use of the force in his favor.  After investigating, Sifo Dias is believed to be dead after stumbling on evidence of a separatist movement on Geonosis.  Evidence is found and the Jedi go back to the council on Coruscant.  Jedi believe that this evidence is important and sends it to the Senate.  Senate, led by a young politician named Padme, suggests new elections be held for new leadership.  Padme suggests every system scrounge up forces to go to Geonosis to confront the small separatist movement.  Qui Gon and Obi Wan travel to Geonosis for recon.  Find a massive droid army being built and confronted by Sith (Darth Maul or Dooku).  QuiGon dies, Sith escapes, republic ""fleet"" arrives too late to catch the separatists and their army.  Ends with uncertainty and the reveal that a young politician named Palpatine was elected as the new Chancellor.

Episode 2:  The separatists have attacked and several systems are falling.  The republic fleet is overwhlemed.  The Chancellor is given emergency powers to do whatever he can to turn the tide.  Obi Wan has taken Anakin as his Padawan.  Padme is being hunted by the separatists and Anakin AND Obi Wan are sent to protect her.  Obi Wan notices romance brewing between the two and warns Anakin not to get too involved.  Palpatine requests that the Jedi go to Kamino to look into a promising cloning facility that may be the key to creating this grand army.  Reluctant and not liking Palpatine's command, the Jedi send Obi Wan since they would like the keep the Jedi on Coruscant close to the Chancellor.  Obi goes and Anakin and Padme have alone time.  Obi finds that Kamino was commissioned by an unknown source to clone humans for slave labor.  These humans have worked on the out rim colonies for years but was kept hidden by certain politicians.  It is this slave labor that led the separatists to want to leave the Republic.  Kamino says that these slaves can be reprogrammed as soldiers for the Republic.  Obi Wan attempts to reveal this information to the council but is too far away.  He calls Anakin and is attacked by Sith midspeech.  Anakin and Padme travel to Kamino to help ObiWan.  Fearing Sith is there to take over the cloning facility for the Separatists, ObiWan, Anakin hunt for Sith while Padme is tasked with blowing up the cloning facility.  Fight ensues, Obi and Anakin cut off the arm of the Sith who still escapes.  Obi and Anakin discover battle plans that from the Sith's missing arm that the Republic Fleet has been destroyed.  Padme, Anakin, and Obi all agree that the clones are a necessary ""evil"" and defuse the bombs to the cloning facility.  Again, uncertainty concludes.  The Jedi meet with the Chancellor revealing the slave intent of the cloning facilities and demand they be shut down immediately after the war is over.   Palpatine agrees acting ""surprised"" that slave labor was present in the Republic.  Jedi also insist that they personally command the clones.  Palpatine agrees.  Closing shot of clones putting on helmets, brandishing weapons, and loading into Star Destroyers.  Begun the Clone Wars have.

Thoughts and critiques?","Anyone else feel that AotC had enough plot to be split and becoming Episode 1 and 2? (Plots rewritten, long reads)"
StarWars,"1. Empire strikes back
Up there with the best sequels ever new locations, original story, Yoda is introduced the showdown luke has with Vader, the trials that luke goes through &gt;! And fails giving us a concluded cliff hanger !&lt; Its all great.

2. Revenge of the Sith
I know not what you expected? Let me explain myself this is Star wars, the darker story was great and the new locations &gt;! Showdown with Annikan and Obi-Wan at the end !&lt; Was such a climatic ending to George Lucases fuck up of Star Wars prequels the dark story felt so fresh and new and not too poorly presented.

3. A new hope
The first classic star wars movie great movie a classic the plot although recycled 3 times was amazing and it is truly a masterpiece. The relationship that develooes between Han and Leia &gt;! Ben Kenobisdeath carryed so much weight !&lt; Amazing movie

4. Return of the Jedi
I absolutely love this movie I have watched it too many times to count, great conclusion to Georges Masterpiece &gt;! The scene where Vader saves Luke !&lt; Was so unexpected when I first watched it my only critique was the Ewoks looked like shit.

5. The Force Awakens
As you will later find out I hate the Disney sequels but this one got me fucking hyped. Although they basically recycled new hopes plot I loved it. I wasn't expecting &gt;! Hans death !&lt; Which caught me completely off guard. While it isn't perfect &gt;! The plot hole for how does Poe get off Jakku !&lt; And some other stupid stuff I enjoyed it. I wish in the later films they developed Reys character more but sadly it never happened.

-------------Below this line are the films I didn't like------------------

6. Attack of the Clones
We'll what can I say? Cheesy as fuck romance scenes with Annikan shit acting Annikan is annyoying as fuck and the films CGI in some places looks like shit. Good stuff: the fight scene with Yoda and Count Dooku was awesome, all the scenes with the clones where amazing and thats about it.

7. Phantom Meanace
What I didn't like: 3 Words Jar Jar Binks and the CGI in some places looked shit, acting in some places was just awful the end where &gt;! Qui gon dies !&lt; Was a great intense fight and duel of the fates never gets old. 

8. Last Jedi
Holy shit I hate this movie, theres so much stupid scenes that didn't need to be in this film. Luke drinking titty milk, why? &gt;! He says he's not gonna face down the first order with a ""laser sword, which he does anyway !&lt; And the scene where &gt;! Leia fucking Mary Poppins flies into the space ship is laughable !&lt;  The start with the slow bombers is completely unnecicerary they are literally &gt;! Killing people for the sake of it !&lt; Don't get me started on the choriography it is complete shit.

9. Rise of Skywalker
The entirevfilm is a muguffin chase that makes no sense. The bit where Rey calls herself &gt;! Rey Skywalker !&lt; Is fucking insulting and it is the most perdictable movie I have ever seen. &gt;! Oh Chewies dead, no he's not it was a differant ship! !&lt; And the plot is a recycled shitty version of Return of the Jedi. &gt;! Leias death makes no sense, she died trying to communicate with someone using the force? Its implied in the OT that she is as powerful as Luke! Wtf !&lt; &gt;! The plot with Palapatine back is fucking lazy, stupid and makes no sense !&lt; 

Thats my ranking, sorry I know I literally tore some of your favourite movies to pieces please understand this is purely my opinion feel free to disagree and disguss with me your thoughts on the movie.","My ranking of the main star wars movies, what's yours?"
StarWars,"Rewatching the prequels for May the 4th got me thinking would an older Anakin have made the prequels better? I actually really enjoyed this rewatch more than I expected. In my opinion it’s heart is in the right place and though I always liked the prequels there is definite room for improvement.

I’m not sure how often this has been brought up but I think that an older Palawan Anakin at the start of episode one would be a good idea. I think that overall this would help with the character progression of Anakin as well as his relationship with Obi-Wan, as well as hopefully reducing his “whininess”. My plan would be to age up his maturity, both physical and emotional, by half an episode.

Episode 1: Anakin is a young, headstrong Padawan recently assigned to Obi-Wan. They are dispatched to a seemingly simple mission regarding trade dispute, appropriate to their skill as a new knight/padawan team. I want to keep Qui-Gon in the picture so maybe he could be introduced shortly after the mission goes pear-shaped as an experienced master. Overall, I think that nothing was gained by making Anakin a young child at this point. All of his slave backstory could be established through dialogue and his limitless potential could easily be established as a padawan. By the end he is still headstrong but more to the level we see mid episode 2, this sets a foundation that allows for more adult growth come episode 2.

Episode 2: Basically the same as the original version but he is now early 20’s and handles things with more experience. This way his headstrong nature comes out in a more appropriate way as legitimate opinions and plans of action from a capable Jedi, rather than the unasked for opinions we actually got. This could also help with the stunted romance that we see by making him an old friend of an appropriate age to Padme, rather than a boy doting on a woman. By the end Padme and Anakin are two young adults fresh from hardships taking solace in each other, and Anakin and Obi-Wans relationship could be one of mutual respect and understanding like we see at the start of episode 3.

Episode 3: Very little changes here. Mostly we see a change that better reflects what Anakin would have gained and lost through constant war if we already establish Anakin as a man the episode prior. He is now a strong, grizzled leader that feels like what the clone wars series helped establish. With Padme I think this too would bring about a better feeling of eminent fatherhood that felt more like a high school pregnancy in the actual movie. This allows Anakin to truly devote more time to the growing darkness, and introspection that would eventually turn him into Vader.

So what do you think? Overall, I think one of the greatest boons to this alteration would be allowing for more onscreen growth as opposed to growth between episodes. I wanted to try to voice a theory that required as little alteration to the movies as possible because, as I stated earlier I really do appreciate the heart of the story established in the prequels.",What would you think of aging Anakin up at the start of the prequels?
StarWars,"TLDR at the end. Obligatory apology for mobile formatting
With The Rise of Skywalker now on Disney+ I’ve been able to rewatch it since it’s release and have a few thoughts. 

My list of critiques (I am a Star Wars fun and even if I sound harsh it comes from a place of love):
There were too many unresolved plot points (hints at Finn being Force sensitive, Rose, rise of the First Order, Anakin’s lightsaber being repaired, and Finn/stormtrooper thing)
Palpatine shouldn’t have returned in the flesh but instead the First Order enacts his backup plans
No forced kiss. I didn’t get a romance vibe but more of a friendship that was based upon Rey wanting to give Han and Leia back their son
Instead of spending half the movie fixing the mistakes, own up to them! Yeah you goofed. Own it and move forward. 

The Force Awakens is my favorite of the Sequels. Even though a lot of it is A New Hope 2.0 they made a real story with new characters and it is undeniably Star Wars

The Last Jedi has my irking for a while I will admit. But a YouTuber named CinemaWins made my grow a small appreciation for the things that were good. I think overall it was meh (I mean that in the weirdest decently bad but good way) movie with some nice sections I enjoyed. 

Now the Prequels, I’m sorry but I am a Prequel lover and no small part of that is due to the age I was when they came out. I was an in upper elementary school and an extension upon some old movies I really liked was coming out? Of course I’m gonna go watch them. I didn’t have any problem with these movies until I was in high school but even then I saw more good than bad. The actors killed it in their roles even if the dialogue in Episode 2 was bad. Revenge of The Sith is an amazing movie with excellent scenes and much improved writing.

Original Trilogy got me started so I will always love it. Enough said. 

Overall my love for Star Wars isn’t diminished. I will always buy a ticket to a Star Wars movie. Am I disappointed, yes. But at the end of the day I still love all of these movies and despite glaring issues, while watching them the first time I was filled with that joy and wonder I did when my cousin handed me a box set of the Original Saga on DVD, Attack of The Clones, and Revenge of The Sith when I was 9 years old. 

TLDR: Even though there are issues, my love for Star Wars hasn’t and will never change. These movies are all good in their own way and even if to some they are mostly bad because they are Star Wars.",I just have a few thoughts I wanna share about the Sequel Trilogy and Skywalker Saga as a whole
StarWars,"I don’t know if this has been done before but what if Palpatine wanted Anakin to lose to Obi Wan on mustafar. This would mean that he can no longer be as powerful as he was meant to be which means he cannot overthrow Palpatine. Also, most of the galaxy knew Anakin as he traveled all around fighting in the clone wars and so the whole galaxy would have known that Darth Vader is just Anakin Skywalker who has suddenly become the emperor’s monster. It really seems like something Palpatine would do given the way he treated Maul and Dooku.",Maybe Palpatine wanted Anakin to be defeated at the hands of Obi-Wan on mustafar
StarWars,"Something that's been bugging me recently, after the death of Darth Bane, the Jedi believed the Sith were no more, and had never heard from them until Maul appeared in Episode I.

This means that any Sith Lords or legends from Bane to Maul would be unheard of by any Jedi, and as such, I doubt anyone in the Jedi Order would have even heard of a Sith Lord called Darth Plagueis, let alone how he died.

So when Palpatine says ""it's not a story the Jedi would tell you"" I assumed he was trying to sow further mistrust between Anakin and the Jedi Council, but you can't really get annoyed at your superiors for not teaching you something they aren't even aware of themselves can you?",The Jedi couldn't tell Anakin the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise!
StarWars,"So I just finished season 7 of the clone wars. Don’t get me wrong I think it’s brilliant how they put this together.

However In my opinion the inhibitor chip stuff just feels.... cheap. I remember the first time I watched episode 3 and felt so shocked at what had happened. I assumed the clones built a close bond with the Jedi when really it was  just a facade, just another protocol they were told to follow until the new order came down. That’s what made episode 3 so impactful to me. Come to find out after watching clone wars that it’s all due to a little chip in their brains that just turns off their connections with Jedi in order to hunt them. 
Idk it just doesn’t hit as hard for me as before. Although I suppose in order to do this final season, they had to find a way to turn off some of the clones per say.

What do you guys think about it?",Anyone else feel weird about the inhibitor chip story line?
StarWars,"With the finale of the clone wars it’s easy to assume that darth mauls story moves on to rebels where he perished. I think there is at least one more major event for him, here is why.
Order 66 happened on 19 bby, that is when maul was last seen escaping the republic ship

Maul died on 2 bby in the twin suns episode of rebels. This gives us a seventeen year time span to work with.

 In the movie solo he told Qi’ra to come to Dathomir where they will work closer together, this was after he gave her all of Dridons stuff in the crimson dawn so it is likely that other crime syndicates are going there too. Solo was estimated to take place on 10-13 bby leaving us with 7-9 years left on mauls life left. 

Maul was likely planning something big including his crime syndicates however in rebels he was working seemingly alone to activate the sith super weapon ( correct me if wrong only read the wiki about it ). So what happened with the crime syndicates? If he did use them he would have brought mercenaries or bounty hunters

Instead I think his access to the crime syndicates were severed or someone took over ( Qi’ra story? ) this leaves a lot of possibilities for possible Darth Maul stories to tell.

Thank you for coming to my tedtalk. I really like Maul and his character so I want more stories and I want to hear other people’s thoughts",Maul Theory. Spoilers for season 7(?)
StarWars,"With the disappointment of the sequel trilogy and with this quarantine not looking to be going away for some time, I decided to try and flesh out a well developed, new Star Wars script. 

This will take a long time, and will go through multiple iterations but will be a continuation of the sequel trilogy but hopefully with a better overarching story and better character development. 

Is there any ideas or things you wanted to see in the recent sequel trilogy, or general ideas you have about cool things to put in a new script. 

This could be settings, people, story arch’s, plot points etc. I have a rough idea about what will happen but I wanted to know if there’s anything I could take inspiration from, based off your wants and needs. 

Let me know :)",I am currently in the early phase of writing a script for a new Star Wars Movie...
StarWars,"Let me start by saying I absolutely loved this final arc. Dave Filoni is a creative genius and mastermind; I’m so glad that he and everyone involved finally got to give us the finale to possibly the best Star Wars content this century. Everything from the character moments to the story to the animation to Kevin Kline’s score is nothing short of breathtaking. It was everything I could’ve hoped for and more. 

All of that said, I’ve come to quite a dilemma...

I have owned the *Ahsoka* novel by E. K. Johnson (published 2016 and declared canon) for quite some time. As I’m sure many others who own the novel have noticed, there are many discrepancies between the novel and the Siege of Mandalore arc.

Some things are minor: a few dialogue changes between Anakin/Ahsoka and Maul/Ahsoka (which could easily be explained as “maybe we just didn’t see their whole interaction”), Ahsoka’s sabers being green while on Mandalore (not as easy of an explanation here, but I’m willing it to let it slide), etc. 

Other things, however, are much more impactful in my opinion: the fact the Rex, Wolfe, and Gregor all have their inhibitor chips removed before the Siege, the fact that Order 66 occurs while Ahsoka and Rex are still on Mandalore, the details in capturing Maul, etc. 


Now, I completely understand that retconning happens all the time in media and entertainment. Things are changed and life goes on. However, as someone who cares (or at least used to care) deeply about Star Wars lore and canon, this doesn’t sit quite right with me. Why would Disney blatantly go against their own established canon here?

Of course, the answer is likely that Dave Filoni was not satisfied with what the novel gave us and wanted to show us his version.

This just feels odd to me after months of Disney and the “Story Team” telling us “The Rise of Skywalker novelization has tons of answers in it! Read it! Buy it! It’s 100% canon!” (Obviously I’m not actually quoting someone here, but you get the idea) Is that novel really canon though? Why is that one and not the *Ahsoka* one? Should we believe that canon only matters unless they come up with a better idea and change it?

It’s equally bizarre when you consider a whole new line of “canon” books are on the way about the High Republic... will those just get retconned by a new show too?

Again, I cannot stress enough that I love what happened in the arc. I am in no way trying to criticize Filoni’s work or lessen what he has done. In fact, I am **happy** with the changes - I like what the arc showed better than the novel! As a fan, I’ve just been almost completely dissuaded from caring about canon now if it can just be thrown out of the window with a flick of a finger. 

I mean, at the end of the day, does this really matter? Probably not. It’s just a retcon that has minimal impact as a whole. At the same time, will I continue buying “canon” books to try and learn as much as I can about Star Wars...? Eh, probably not.",Regarding established canon and Ahsoka [SPOILERS]
StarWars,"First off, I don’t want to start a battle over people’s preference of the sequel trilogy over any other movies/tv episodes. Also, I’ve never read any of the novels so perhaps it’s been discussed there but not on screen. This is what I’m enquiring about. 

In TROS we saw(on screen) for the first time a ship being pulled out of the air by the force by Rey. In TCW S07E12 Ahsoka does the same thing. 

I remember seeing TROS in theatres thinking that scene seemed rather like a “jump the shark” moment. It was really cool, but nowhere had we ever seen this, or anything close to it, done by a Jedi or Sith. It seemed rather “overpowered” for what a force wielder could do, based on what we’ve seen them do before on screen(as well as the force healing and Palpatine disabling an entire fleet with lightning - very cool but never seen before). And then Ahsoka goes and does the same thing. 

I can’t help but think that they had Ahsoka do this only because of the events in TROS(since TCW was released afterwards) in an attempt to make what Rey did seem plausible. 

Was there ever any mention in the novels of Jedi or Sith being able to pull ships out of the sky prior to TROS? At the same time was there any mention in the novels about force healing prior to TROS?",Clone Wars S07E12 &amp; TROS vs All Others
StarWars,"I wanted to know you guys thoughts on this. I think one of the most underrated pros of Hayden’s Anakin was how smooth he was in lightsaber combat. You can tell he is exceptionally athletic and coordinated. I was an all state wide receiver, played a year in college, and I still can’t find myself imitating some of the moves that were done in the movie. He had a flow that none of the other actors had in the prequels. Literally every fight between Anakin and *insert name here* was mesmerizing to watch and I find myself going back time and time again to watch them on YouTube just to figure out how he did some of it. Now I’m sure hollywood has plenty of other actors that are equally athletic, but he just had a flow to him that, like I said before, is mesmerizing. 

I just don’t get what people didnt like about him and it’s sad. He LOOKS like a perfect anakin. This was a comment I stole from YouTube but totally made sense, but his facial expressions in episode III just looked like pure evil. I think the exact comment was when he wasn’t talking (due to the bad scripts) he had the most intimidated presence of anyone on screen. I find this very true. The scene after he kills the separatist and his eyes turn yellow. Evil. The scene after Obi Wan tells Padme he is “so sorry” and anakin is looking at the lava river on mustafar. Pain. The scene when he starts crying in the chambers. Pain. He captures the emotions perfectly. Like PERFECTLY. 

I just really want to see a comeback with Hayden. I don’t care if it’s 2 minutes of screen time, he just embodies Star Wars for me. I grew up with him, and I don’t think there will ever be anyone more special to me in all of Star Wars. 

And lastly, if this ever gets to Hayden Christensen, I’m sorry for the way you were treated after the prequels, I’m sorry how bad Kathleen Kennedy treated your for the sequels, and there are literally MILLIONS of people who would give their left nut for you to make a return as Anakin. And I think I speak for the majority of the Star Wars fan base that we all love you. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk",Hayden Christensen appreciation post
StarWars,"It pains me a bit to know we’ll never see Grievous capturing the Chancellor from Coruscant. I can imagine the Separatists arriving out of hyperspace, or something, into the atmosphere. Then bunch of droids and Grievous ambush the senate building or smash through the Chancellor’s chambers windows, where he’s at, and snatch him. It pains me not to see the effect on the galaxy right after the droids were shut down... 

nevertheless, I really like how it ended. It was personal, and it needed to be. Order 66 was seen in ep 3 on such a macro emotional level and for it to been shown on a micro level, is something I didn’t even think about it. The end is still emotional to me, in some weird way, and that’s literally never happened before after consuming a piece of ~~entertainment~~ art. A mix of nostalgia, melancholy, hopelessness. The music absolutely added to this strange feeling. It too was an odd mix. It was score you heard in ep 3 and music you hear associated with dark force users. Uncertainty, darkness, sadness. Dark Maul and Asoka, for me, quickly changed from being characters I never cared much for, to becoming some of my favorite in the entire saga. The both grew and developed and were the Clone Wars creations. The characters, including Rex, didn’t exist until the show started. Sure Maul did, but he died and was never really had a personally anyway. It’s only fitting that the three get their ending together. 

Great job David. I hope this guy can direct some movies in the future.","I thought the Clone Wars would end differently, but I’m really satisfied with how it did -also the the music."
StarWars,"There's some things I know about their species that I remember from the guide to Star wars species book I'm not sure how much of it is still Canon. 

Their home planet is a grassland planet. On their planet they're still primitive and live in tribes.even though their planet was discovered a couple thousand years ago they still haven't joined the republic.Their culture is somewhat conformist and showing individuality is a taboo.

 The markings on their face and head tails and sometimes other parts of their body evolved as a way to camouflage them from predators.

 The race is very social and if they're forced to spend time alone they often suffer from depression and extreme anxiety. They also like live prey and like to eat insects and small rodents.

They also rarely leave their planet unless they are recruited by the Jedi order.this causes some people to believe that all members of their species possess the force.",I was wondering how much of the original backstory behind Ahsoka's species of the Togruta is still Canon. Here are some things I remember about her species from the Star wars guided species book.
StarWars," I think Barriss is CRIMINALLY underused. She was shown to be incredibly intelligent, memorize the entirety of genosian tunnels. Plan the bombing and almost get away with it, see the flaws in the republic that the Jedi couldn't. And shown to be very powerful in the force, being able to defeat Asajj and Ahsoka, and put up a relatively good fight against Anakin. Having her blow herself up like what was originally planned would be such a waste. I really hope we can see her make up with Ahsoka (cause lets be real she is the only acceptable ship for Ahsoka). It was also mentioned that she wouldn't be an inquisitor because even if she was against the jedi, she wasn't evil and still had good in her. (said by Dave Filoni)",[SPOILERS] Barriss Offee
StarWars,"I don’t know man, they were just so underwhelming to me. Do you think this was a stylistic choice; I.e. it’s these are fairly young force users in a time where being a swordsman was unheard of? Or do you think it could be just lazy writing/choreography on the directors side? Or could it be something else entirely? All I know was that I was very disappointed by the direction in these last 3 films. Hopefully going forward, away from the skywalker saga, we can get back to our bad ass fights circa the prequel era.",Who else thought the lightsaber battles in the sequel trilogy were mediocre at best?
StarWars,"So while watching the Rise of Skywalker, there is a scene where Rey is saying goodbye to Leia before she goes off to find the Wayfinder. In this scene Leia tells Rey to never be afraid of who she is. Rey seems to read Leia's face and there is a shared look between the two. This made me think back to the Last Jedi when Luke meets Rey and spends basically their entire time hesitant about who she is exactly and he seems to be highly suspect about her nature in the Force. 

You see, I think that Luke and Leia knew that Rey was the genetic descendant of Papa Shiv. Maybe not like, Bing she a Palps, more like they could hear the echos of his hatred and connection to the Dark Side screaming at them through her. This would satisfy both while Luke was harsh with Rey at first then warmed up to her and it would also explain while Leia would take a direct active hand in her training. At the beginning of Rise to Skywalker, Rey is attempting to connect with the Force Ghosts of the previous Jedi who were still connected to the Force. I would assume that this was done at Leia's direction after potentially speaking with Luke's Force Ghost. 

This means that Luke and Leia would have had to been casually aware of Palpatine existence. This would also explain why Luke left looking for the secrets of the Jedi, found something that damaged his calm and forced him into exile. What was that something....maybe a crisis of faith ala Dark Empire encountering the spirit of the Emperor. 

I swear this movie gets better every single time I watch it.",Did Luke and Leia know that Rey was a Palpatine?
StarWars,So near the end of Rise of Skywalker there is a fight between Rey and some guards and Ben and the Knights of Ren. Rey uses some sort of force deflection to throw blaster bolts at some of the guards. The scene cuts to Ben fighting. When we come back to Rey they use the same shot of her deflecting bolts. It looks identical to me. I watched it a few times. Then I tried to Google it and there are a million articles about the ending being reused. So many that it would be impossible to write an article about an actual reused shot. Anyone have any insight on this? Did you notice the shot too? Did Disney make a smoke screen to hide their mistake?,Rise of Skywalker rewatch.
StarWars,"Hey Reddit,

I'm doing a University assignment and I'm looking into the future of CGI from a fan's perspective. I'll be asking multiple questions on different subreddits and trying to identify patterns in responses. If you have any examples of poor CGI in the franchise I'd love to hear and I'd also love to hear your thoughts on what you think the future holds for CGI in the Star Wars franchise! I also know that the franchise has completed most of its films but some thoughts would still be appreciated!

Thanks!",What is the future of CGI in the Star Wars franchise?
StarWars,"I have loved Star Wars my entire life, and especially always loved The Clone Wars. 

But Episode 9 singlehandedly made nearly every single sacrifice any hero made from 32 BBY (The Phantom Menace) to Anakin's final act to balance the force completely meaningless. Every war fought throughout the known Star Wars saga has lost all it's weight, as the rightful climax of the series in Episode 6 has been retconned;  Palpatine never died.

I don't know if I am the only one who feels this way, but I just feel like the heart of Star Wars was Anakin's arc, and now I can't seem to enjoy that arc knowing that it doesn't actually accomplish anything in the long run. These fantastic Clone Wars episodes just don't feel the same even. Anakins struggle is now less realized, and even though the the fall of the Republic is coming, none of it even matters in the long run.

 Every single choice in Episode 9, mainly Palpatine's return and Rey being a Palpatine, just made the entire Star Wars galaxy feel incredibly small and insignificant, cheesy even. And now I just can't seem to become invested in this beautifully lived in, galaxy again after what JJ did to it.",I can't enjoy The Clone Wars because of Episode 9
StarWars,"Spoilers for those who haven't seen tRoS:





So with D+ finally getting RoS yesterday and rewatching it for the first time in the theater over the winter, I got to wondering about the voices that Rey hears during the final fight with Sheevs... 

We now know who's talking to her and most of them make sense, Qui-Gon, Kenobi, Ashoka, Luke. Others have me scratching my head, why would Luminara, Aayla, or Adi be included with them being such unknown Jedi and minor characters in TCW (I had to look them up even though I just finished the series re-watch)? Even Kanan is a bit of a stretch IMO. 

Is there a reason those three were included? Where they special in any way that wasn't made clear in TCW, something I missed?",Why Rey Heard The Voices She Did?
StarWars,"What if instead of the storyline we had, tros plot really pushed rey’s fall into darkness while also showing kylo rising. Ok hear me out guys.

Rey is indeed a nobody. Her parents abandoned her on jakku because they were either afraid of her abilities or whatever might come of it (or maybe they just didn’t want her).

Kylo’s still struggling with the light and guilt of killing his father, and the soon death oh Leia starts to push him towards the light. 

Rey isn’t a palpatine but could instead be plagued by visions or apparitions of the late emperor pushing her towards the dark side. While pulling away from her friends and the rebellion as a whole as she starts to dive deeper into who she truly is.

There is a huge power struggle within the first order and the generals as they feel kylo isn’t truly wanting to work towards the goal they were hoping for.

And it all boils down to Rey vs kylo in the end where Rey unfortunately loses the battle in the end

This is just a Skelton idea but it’s been on my mind a lot and I would just like to tell someone my idea for how the movie could’ve been. I just think if instead of being the stereotypical “good guys win the end” type of movie it would’ve been a lot more interesting if they really pushed Rey to the dark side and made her go full ‘Empress Rey’ in the end. Just think about how interesting it would’ve been if we followed this character that we’ve grown to love (or at least some people have) and seems altruistically good but turns out to be the opposite due to outside forces (maybe somewhat like the Anakin arch). It would’ve definitely made a lot more sense than what we eventually got (in my opinion) and it would’ve cleared up a lot of the confusion about the whole palpatine situation (which c’mon how are you going to bring him back to life off screen?) Kylo had a steady arch throughout the whole trilogy so it would make sense that he would be the meaning behind “the rise of skywalker” instead him just turning good in the 3rd act of the film and Rey just saying “ok I’m a skywalker now”. 

I get it’s Disney so there’s probably money and politics behind the direction they decided to go with this film but it’s just an idea I had and I would love to hear other people’s opinions.

P.s I know I could’ve elaborated a little more so let me know where I should",Rise of skywalker alternate plot
StarWars,"The original trilogy just isn't that great, especially compared to the prequels. 

Luke is a pretty boring character, as are Han Solo and Chewbacca. The rebels, and their fight scenes, are also boring. There is little character development. The action is just... meh. The only shining light is the relationship between Vader and Luke. 

The prequels aren't perfect, but they're comfortably more interesting plot-wise and character-wise than the OT. Anakin is compelling, as are Obi-Wan, Sidious and the clone war plot generally. 

Revenge of the Sith is comfortably the best SW movie, and I don't think it's particularly close...","I have just rewatched the first six Star Wars films. The original trilogy, barring the relationship of Darth Vader and Luke, is boring as hell."
StarWars,"I think there are number of times where it might be of note that Episode 4 uses the idea of families having arguments or small arguments as part of it's over all story structure. It makes it more relatable and interesting. It seems that it would follow a pattern of fear (threat) first, followed by the nullification of  the fear, followed then by anger (I'm using these terms lightly in the context of a fun adventure). I'm aware of and don't discount the euphoria felt by the characters after some of the instances of the nullification of fear.

Here's some that I can think of:

Droids with Death Star plans almost get caught, they get away in the escape pod, they're arguing in the desert

Luke attacked and overtaken by the the sand people, rescued by Obi-Wan, technically arguing with Kenobi by resisting to go to Alderaan

Luke almost gets wasted in the cantina, saved by Kenobi, leads to arguing with Han Solo

Millennium Falcon and crew being chased by the Empire, escape by going to into hyper-space, Han arguing with both Luke and Kenobi about the Force.

The Falcon being taken by force into the Death Star, Han's quick exchange with Kenobi when they emerge from hiding (or their arguing in the small command module room thereafter)

Leia's threat of execution, Darth Vader options to not do it, she's arguing with Han during detention center shoot out.

The heroes almost get smashed in the compactor, they escape from this, Leia arguing with Han - and Chewbacca little

StarWars,"When I first started watching the Clone Wars, I was excited to find out how Anakin got the scar over his eye. I started with the Clone Wars movie, and when I started it, he already had it. We are told how he got it, but I was extremely disappointed that we didn’t get to actually see it happen. There’s also other things that happen between the two that I think should be addressed, like the the introduction of Asajj Ventress. And it just dove directly into the fighting. I really want stories on things like Rex an Cody being assigned to Anakin and Obi-Wan, and everything else in between. Does anyone know of anything where this area of time was established or is it all just up in the air?

StarWars,"Hey guys! I was watching rebels today and I stumbled across something that got my gears turning. Can anyone confirm if this is true? Or already canon.

So as we know Jaro is a Lesat male who was among the few Jedi to made use of a dual blade. 

The double bladed saber was originally a sith design. It was made popular by Exar Kun, The Inquisitors and Darth Maul (all dark side users) and the Jedi Temple Guard (one light side exception). The weapon itself was designed to help the user excel in fights against other lightsaber users (and deflect blaster fire however you could achieve the latter through the use of two single sabers) with the risk of hurting ones self oftwn outweighing the reward, so using double sided sabers was frowned upon by the Jedi order. 

The order encouraged the use of a single lightsaber or two single bladed lightsabers, bearing one in each hand. While it was not unheard of to wield a double blade, it was exceptionally rare. The temple guard can be justified as they would be the most likely to encounter another combatant armed with a saber. Also at the ""end of their shift"" for lack of a better term, the saber was passed to the next rotation so it was never the temple guardsmens personal weapon. 

So why was Jaro Tapul allowed to make an exception and gave his personal weapon be a double sided sabre?

I think I stumbled across the reasoning in an episode of my Revenge of the Fifth binging of Star Wars Rebels...

In Rebels Zab, Another male Lesat carries with him a weapon called a bow rifle. This looks alot like a double sided electrified spear (like you see Grievouss guards have) and slightly resembles a double bladed sabre. He mentions that this is the traditional weapon for the warriors of his people..

And there we have it. 

I believe Jaro would have been accustomed to wielding this type of weapon prior to his entrance to the order in the first place, which is why the order allowed him to make his own sabre a double blade. Not only would he have had the training to ensure he was safe, but he also trained with a double weapon without the malicious intent of bringing ones demise. Also a jedi weapon is meant to be an extension of one's self, and by making his saber a double blade and tying it back to his people, he did just that.",Why I believe Jaro Tapul was allowed to practice with a double sided light sabre...
StarWars,"...would Rex still have survived the Siege of Mandalore/Order 66 arc?

I'd say it's pretty likely that Rex was always meant to overcome Order 66 and protect Ahsoka as he did in the arc, simply because it's such a strong storytelling experience. Filoni never got to wrap up this loose end before TCW was cancelled, and later on reintroduced Rex to Rebels to, among other reasons, reveal the fate we never got to see onscreen.

Do you guys think it's possible that, if Filoni never established Rex's fate for Rebels and instead TCW finished to the end, Rex would've died at the end of the Clone Wars - sacrificing his life for Ahsoka's? It certainly would have made the arc even more tragic and poignant: Rex would be buried among Jesse and his brothers while fighting for different causes, and we would've seen Vader's reaction to finding out that his clone captain, one of his best friends, died as a result of his actions.",(Siege of Mandalore speculation) If Dave Filoni and his team didn't make Rebels first...
StarWars,"The Taika Waititi announcement originally had me... concerned?

I like some of the MCU, Captain America, black panther and Spiderman homecoming I think are really good, and it's because they're different. I think the fact that most of the movies are set in the same sort of futuristic present, and also have very similar plots, really makes it hard to get excited for each movie. A lot of the time the plot goes: the characters are introduced, the conflict is set up, the villain looks like winning until some reveal/surprise at the end turns the tide. It also takes away from the rewatchability, for the reasons I said before, plus skipping some doesn't take away much from the overall series. Star Wars on the other hand, even if you don't like some of the movies, you can't really skip any and still understand the main saga.

I think one of the strengths of Star Wars is that there are only 11 films. It makes you really keen for each new movie. Even though some of the movies (ANH and TFA for example) are similar in some ways, watching them doesn't feel like I've seen this story fleshed out 10 times already.

As for more Star Wars content, I think the Disney+ series are a great idea (besides the Cassian one, but we'll see it might turn out to be good). I really like how the Mandalorian has a different style (samurai/western), and I think it would be great if each different series has its own style, while still being connected in some way to the main saga.

TL;DR I don't want to be oversaturated by the same kind of Star Wars movie 4 times a year, because that will just take away what's special about Star Wars to me.",I really hope Star Wars doesn't turn in to Marvel
StarWars,"In the last few episodes of Clone Wars, Maul seems more powerful with the force than normal. He invades Jesse’s mind, redirects blaster bolts with ease, and shows off incredible feats of telekinesis while dodging countless blaster bolts on his rampage through the Star Destroyer during Order 66. Now, it’s possible that Maul is normally capable of such feats. But at least from what I remember, he has never shown this level of power before or after. Since all of this happens at the end of the war and during order 66, the time when the dark side of the force was at its strongest, what if that gave Maul a tangible boost in power?",[Spoiler] Theory about Maul
StarWars,"Ok, so I must admit (and don't tear me down here) but Star Wars has never really taken my fancy, OH watches it, and I might get a bit of it, whilst I do other things, mainly looking at my phone or pottering about the house. 

After he watched the newer release this evening, we were talking about it, and then I actually showed an interest (for the second time, my first interest got side tracked with other things, that I thought were much more interesting) 

Anyway I digress... 

We were talking about the order in which the films were released, and my mind is blown, I cannot get my head around why you would intentionally make a 3, 4, &amp; 5 to release a 1, 2 &amp; 3 and then 6, 7, 8 with a 3.5 thrown if for good measure somewhere in between. 

So, I guess the question really is, if you were to know somebody, who wanted to watch the entire set of films, which way would you recommend it is done? 

The order of release or in order by number? 

Or am I so far behind now, that there really isn't any point and will I be disappointed for wasting so much of my time, even if we are in a lockdown with not much else to do? 

TL;DR Never seen Star Wars, not sure if I want to, but if I did, in which order should I watch them?

They let you hear the voices of the Jedi masters and anakin, but only let you see luke and Leia. Of course im a prequel person, but they could have made us prequel people happy, by showing us the original Jedi masters one last time. And how Rey is just able to use dark side force powers by doing almost nothing, is shit. Also when palpatine, I guess sucked the force out of Rey and Ben, didnt kill them immediately, makes no sense.

She has the best quality of a great Jedi even though she doesn't she herself a Jedi. The last episode of TCW really shows how a Jedi should act even in the most darkest and pressing time.

StarWars,"Most of the liea talk and scenes drive me nuts bc they are basically made after looking at the film they had of Carrie fisher and then writing the story. THATS WHAT THEY DID! the idea should have been scrapped immediately and rewritten with her death offscreen. 

The very beginning was so forced and erratic I’m just embarrassed. It’s almost bittersweet considering we got taika now. Boom! 

When they show up to the festival there is nothing that happens and then all of a sudden Skype call and chase. Oh and let’s throw in lando and force a “I got a bad feeling about this” and then a cringe “never underestimate a droid”

Then the “they fly now” turned into a stupid cgi crash. After the mandalorians final sequence it is absolutely unacceptable! 

While the first 40 minutes of TFA was the only movie, maybe rogue one, that held anything to the originals, I’d say the first 40 minutes of ROS is absolutely terrible! 

And FINALLY the knights of ren, yet not really bc you Barely see them. 

I really hope taika is able to do what I think we all wanted and mix what was great about the prequels and originals. The sequel has nothing to do with the prequels at all and no sign of them. What the mandalorian did with the clone wars flashbacks was perfect. 

I really hope we see a completely new story weather it goes back, (the Jedi mandalorian wars mentioned in clone wars, rebels and the mandalorian could be cool) or something in the future but I would like it to be a high point of the Jedi so we get the vastness of new places, characters and action that the clone wars style proved everyone can dig! 

So just so not to confuse everyone it’d be prolly more prequel style but hint at the OT enough. You have to imagine what most fans were thinking going into the prequels. The disappointment with the phantom menace was it was nothing like the originals. But the clone wars showed us how great the prequel era really can be. 

I couldn’t imagine getting something like the clone wars finale back in 1999 when the phantom menace is all we got. That’s the perfect mix of all the Star Wars, it really was and can be used a beautiful blueprint for the future of Star Wars. 

They should be able to tell an incredible story thru one or two trilogies and some spinoff arcs similar to the best clone wars arcs. Maybe in ten years were spitting out 2 then 3 Star Wars a year like marvel.

One was the Emperor at a temp agency, which still cracks me up to this day, and there was a trilogy of ""deleted scenes"" of Ben talking to Luke at different points throughout the movies.

Beginning in 1999 with the Phantom Menace, and now ending with Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the past 21 years of prequel content we have received is extraordinary. From George's prequel films to his idea that would be the Clone Wars movie and show. This era of Star Wars carries more weight with me, than any other. From the retcons of lore (the clone inhibitor chip) to the building of character that wasn't available in the movies (Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan, etc.), to the numerous games and music (thank you John Williams, and Lucas Arts) that were all spawned from these past 21 years, I can only look upon these years as a Star Wars fan with delight, and admiration. The Clone Wars has revolutionized Star Wars, and hopefully it is a revolution that will continue with the Mandalorian season 2 coming up.

However, there are still Star Wars fans out there that haven't been able to have this experience that I, and many others have experienced. I implore you, those that did not watch the Clone Wars, to do so now. Now that is it has ended, and we are in isolation, there is no better time. To go back, to a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, one cloaked in turmoil and deceit. Where actions of heroes on both sides come together to make a story unlike any other.

StarWars,"The episode shows Ezra entering a Jedi Temple which is essentially in between time and space. He is able to save Ashoka from dying in the past and brings her to the present. Imagine if Palpatine got hold of this temples power, he could have pulled out a dark side Anakin before he got his limbs cut off. Or Obi-Wan could have pulled out an light side Anakin and challenge Palpatine. Yoda could have gone to the past to warn the rest of the council of Palpatine before it was too late. So much potential of new stories from the temple and yet I have seen little to attention to it at all.","Has anyone realized the amount of potential and new timelines the Rebels Episode ""Wolves and a Door"" has created"
StarWars,"Hear me out, nostalgia could be a factor as this was the first Star Wars film I saw in theaters at age 10 in 2005. It blew me away the and it still blows me away now. The opening sequence is one of the most exciting scenes in all of Star Wars, a huge epic space battle turns into to two heroic Jedi fighting their way to rescue the chancellor. An epic light saber ensues and it’s great. The final act in this movie so about the last hour cannot be beaten nor will it ever be beaten in terms of Star Wars. The duels, emotion, the tragedy, it’s all done perfectly. And of course it’s fun. Although empire strikes back is the better made movie it’s not as fun for me as revenge of the Sith.",Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie(yes even better than empire)
StarWars,"I may just be tired of star wars at this point because the rise of skywalker left me feeling so empty, but this left me so unimpressed. There are some decent ideas in this, but they never do anything interesting or creative. The plot is insanely predictable, i pretty much guessed the entire thing as it progressed. Every time It's given a chance to do something interesting it just throws that away to reference revenge of the sith for the billionth time. Like yes we get it this takes place during revenge of the sith, you don't have to remind us every 5 minutes. It also ends leaving so many questions unanswered as if we're supposed to connect the dots ourselves. The last two episodes are decent and the last episode actually made me feel positive emotions so that's something at least. The conflict between ahsoka, rex and the clones was pretty hard to watch considering I've spent 13 years watching these characters fight alongside eachother.

Overall though I refuse to believe Dave Filoni had complete creative control over this, it just has Disney written all over it. If the rise of skywalker hadn't left me so empty then I think this would've broken my spirits. This was soulless and uninspired and I have never been so unimpressed. Star Wars the clone wars deserved a way more respectful ending than this.

StarWars,"Spoilers for Rebels. Like, major ones.

So at the time of Rebels airing season 1, everyone just *knew* that Kanan was going to die. He had to. Otherwise there would still be a Jedi left at the time of the OT films 

The way that they did it though? I cry every time. I was in absolute tears watching it just now. The lack of speech and very emotional score, mixed with a elegant and sleek environment (is this becoming a trend or something) just pulls at the heartstrings. 

In stopping the explosion he uses all of his might to save his friends still. Then of course to make you try again, they restore his sight for just a second, and in that one second he sees the love of his life- he just sees for the last time. He sees hope still. They make the explosion colourful, like all of the Rebels' previous ones showing that they still have a chance after the great sacrifice. And to make it even worse, you remember that Zeb and Chopper and the rest of the crew never said goodbye. 

As for episode 11, we finally understand just how much Kanan meant to Ezra. He goes back to his old ways without him very quick (his method of choosing what way to go for example) and doesn't know where to go. Bringing Kanan back as a Loth Wolf further shows is that Ezra has a connection to Lothal. The whole planet is literally his family too, and Kanan is a part of that, he's never going to leave.

It's just so well done. I'm always crying at it. Filoni and Pablo Hidaglo truly are a masterpiece dream team.",I was rewatching Rebels and completely forgot about the artistry that is episode 10 and 11

StarWars,"Watching the finale of Clone Wars yesterday and was having fun trying to place the epilogue scene with Darth Vader in terms of the chronology of the series. The quick cut to this scene makes it feel like there hasn't been much of a time jump, but all of the tech and armor (Lambda shuttle, Stormtroopers, etc.) seems to point to this taking place several years later or more. My personal head cannon (until Filoni confirms otherwise) is that this may be taking place during Vader's search for clues about Ahsoka in the months prior to their confrontation in Twilight of the Apprentice. Curious what everyone else thinks!",When does the Clone Wars epilogue take place?

StarWars,"1: We obviously saw Savage Oppress kill Adi Gallia. We saw Grievous capture her the previous season, so if we had him kill her then instead it could have made him look better. Still cool to see Savage prove himself a formidable opponent though.

2: Eeth Koth wasn't in RotS and was captured by Grievous in season 2. Again, could have had Grievous kill him then

3: When Ima-Gun Di had his final stand in season 3, he was obviously gunned down by droids. What we could have seen was Di and Captain Keeli defeat the droids, then Grievous comes and kills them both.

4: If you've read Dark Disciple you know what happens to Ventress after TCW. But what they could have done was when Grievous invades Dathomir, have him succeed in killing Ventress.

5: In ARC troopers, Grievous fights Obi-Wan on Kamino while Anakin fights Ventress and Shaak Ti does nothing. What they could have done was have some other Jedi knight or master there instead of Obi-Wan and have Grievous kill that Jedi. Because really, there was no tension in that fight since we knew they'd both survive. Maybe that could have been where Grievous killed Koth or Gallia.",Five ways they could have made Grievous a more formidable opponent in TCW
StarWars,"Hey guys I just watched Rise of the Skywalker as it just came out on Disney + (late to the party I know), and thankfully it hadn't been spoiled for me all this time.

At the end of the movie, &gt;!she adopts the name Skywalker. !&lt; I understand this is a contentious point for some in the fanbase.

I just wanted to make the point that hasn't it heavily been theorised that Palpatine created Anakin in Shimi's womb using his sith manipulation of life. If a star wars expert has confirmation on this lemme know. Anyhow this Palpatine connection accounts for the Skywalker lines affinity for the force. 

Therefore Palpatine is Anakin's father through the force as he created Anakin in Shimis womb. In essence the skywalker line is a derivation of Palpatine line. This would make Anakin and Rey's father ""half-brothers"" through the force, Rey's father being the biological offspring of Palpatine and Anakin being Palpatine's offspring through sith manipulation of midi-chlorians. This would make Palpatine Ben's Great-Grandfather via the force. Rey's father would be Ben's Granduncle via the force and finally, Rey would be Ben's first cousin once removed.

 Palpatine being the origin of Rey and Bens force powers through their respective lineages. Maybe this is why they are Dyads?

StarWars,"in tcw, rush clovis is a supporting character thats there to make anakin jealous and demonstrate some of his darkside tendencies. this isnt achieved as well as it could be (looking specifically at his plotline in s6), because:

 i) clovis behaves underhandedly, justifying anakin's suspicion. 

ii) clovis makes a couple of passes at padme, and anakin lashes out at him over catching clovis trying to kiss her. anakins assumption that something is happening between them is perfectly understandable here, so the whole ""youve gotta trust your wife"" thing doesnt land.

iii)  the only mitigating factor that's meant to make his actions unjustified is that padme isnt into clovis. this element works but its hammered in so much in the story that clovis is framed as a dick that cant take a hint and the audience doesnt get to view the perspective that matters (anakins).

if clovis didnt collaborate with dooku, didnt overtly come onto padme, and padme wasnt shown to be totally disinterested, then the story would work a lot better to highlight how controllingly jealous anakin is.",rush clovis fails as a supporting character
StarWars,"For me, it’s the scene at the Sarlacc pit in Return of the Jedi. It just has everything in a Star Wars scene that you can expect, action, drama, a bit of comedy. Most major characters from the original trilogy, not just one but TWO huge alien type creatures, a plan that has some hiccups but eventually works out, and of course you can’t forget the cheesy effects of the sail barge exploding and them flying away.

What scene in the movies, TV shows or any other media do you feel just fully embodies Star Wars?",What do you think is the most Star Wars scene in Star Wars?
StarWars,"By connecting Luke and Vader as first son and man who killed his father, and then as son and father, it upped the stakes dramatically and *immediately*. It informed all of Luke's (and Vader's) actions for the entire trilogy.

Rey and Kylo being strangers made a great deal of Rey's behavior seem forced (why is she so preoccupied with turning Kylo in TLJ, a man she only met days earlier and hates?). The fact that they were strangers hampered the development they wanted to happen in the film. Having no time-jump between VII and VIII also hampered that development. 

They followed the blueprint of the Luke/Vader interactions and eventual culmination without establishing the foundation for those interactions and culmination. 

It's somewhat reminiscent of Star Trek into Darkness, where they recreated a death scene that originally occurred between two people who were friends for decades, but this time around they had it happen between two people who were just getting to know eachother.","The decision by TLJ to force the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship into the Luke/Vader pattern (""Join me""; ""I can turn him"") was probably the biggest mistake of the sequel trilogy."
StarWars,"I would love to hear everyone's theories on this.

With the exception of Rey and Kylo in ep 9, Starkiller in TFU, and maybe a few other times, Jedi use so much restraint when it comes to the force. They will stand and watch the enemy get away, or fly away into space, they rarely use items in their surroundings to attack enemies.

Is this kinda reatraint taught to the Jedi as they grow up and are trained, or is it a choice to maybe fight fairly?? Or maybe doubt of their abilities??

Why let the enemy get away on foot, force trip them and catch them

Why let the enemy get on a ship and fly away, force grab the ship and pull it back.

Why not use movement as a distraction, force push or pull objects at your enemy.

Every sith in the movies has used the force to throw objects in battle, but Vader stands idly by as Leia's ship gets away in Rogue One.

Is using the force in this manner considered cheating or not fighting fairly to the Jedi?
Is it considered using the dark side?

Yoda says ""size matters not"" so according to him, everyone who can use the force should be able to move ANYTHING with their mind.

Could it be that alot of jedi doubt their own abilities and don't even try it???","Is ""use of the force restraint"" taught to jedi as they train, or is it a choice"
StarWars," Certain Youtube arguments about this topic and Ahsoka's all canon feats in general had me thinking...

While Anakin has always been regarded as the most talented Jedi, the literal Chosen One, going by everything seen in canon continuity, Ahsoka has never been far behind in terms of talent. Even as a young Padawan, she could at least put up a fight against the likes of Ventress and Grievous. These two are obviously inferior to Maul, but are both capable of challenging Jedi Masters (not just Knights, but Masters), so a regular Padawan should be nothing but fodder to them. Ahsoka was obviously at least at a solid Knight level herself at that time, official Padawan rank being there mostly due to her youth and lack of experience.

Ahsoka progressed so fast in terms of both power and skill during the war due to a combination of raw talent and constant combat experience, that she actually caught up with Maul by the very end of the conflict. The same Maul who's superior to an average Master. While the fight was quite close, her beating him places her nearly at Council level power. Of course, she couldn't officially progress past her Padawan rank, as she wasn't a part of the Order anymore. So yeah, while her progress seems more believable than Rey's (taught by Anakin himself, plus constant war experience), going from Padawan level to Council level in the span of a few years while having neither Skywalker nor Palpatine blood makes her quite a Mary Sue (not that it makes her a worse character in any way).

Later, in her novel, and in Rebels, she seems to have progressed even further. Inquisitors are basically no threat to her. Maul is her peer at most, more likely an inferior. Ahsoka actually put up a fight against roughly prime Vader. A Sith around Sidious's level, who makes Maul and Dooku (both being Jedi Master killers) look like amateurs. She had no hope of winning, but still, between her actually fighting Vader for a time, and standing up to Sidious's sorcery just a few minutes later, comfortably places her among the top Council level Jedi. Quite likely superior to any version of Obi Wan, for example, inferior only to Yoda, Mace and ROTS Anakin (maybe..).

Am I wrong in my assessment?","Is Ahsoka Really This Powerful, Or Am I Missing Something? (canon, possible CW spoilers)"
StarWars,"This is my first post so sorry if there is any mistakes, i just wanted to get this of my chest even if it is to random strangers over the internet.

I can't rember a time where my parents weren't divorced and my dad really struggled, he was depressed and he really struggled to take care of me, my twin brother and my older sitser but that's when my dad introduced me and my brother to star wars and I instantly loved the franchise

. One day we were surfing channels when we came across star wars the clone wars so we watched it the next time it was on (it was on at about 7 pm I think) me and my twin brother loved it and so did my dad so we started to watch it a lot and it was great. It was great, my dad seemed to be as exited for it just as much as we were. I don't have a perfext relationship with my Dad but I love to look back at these times when watching the clone wars and to see how it help us through tough times.

StarWars,"The series finale of the clone wars really brought tho ya into perspective for me. I was never sure how I felt about order 66 being mandated by a chip opposed to the clones just following orders, it made sense for the clone wars show but that’s about as far as I took it. With these last two episodes we really see the emotion side of things. 

First with Rex right after order 66 is given. He’s shaking with tears in his eyes as he’s about to execute the girl he has know for years. We see it again with Jesse. He almost doubts the order at the request of Rex in the hanger bay before gathering his resolve again. 

The whole point of the clone wars show was to display who the clones were. Not as a group. Identical meat bags but each individuals with personality. They have potential beyond their station as soldiers, heck we even see one with a family in Deserter. Even in Cat and Mouse we see a clone made a personal decision to betray the Republic. The clones are their own person, they make decisions and they control who they are. 

But not when order 66 came. It destroyed who they were as persons. No longer did they have choice. They only had their orders. Ahsoka realizes this, she tells Rex it’s not his fault, it’s the chip. She insists to not kill any of the troops, even if they are willing to die, she will not be the one to kill them. When she and Rex escaped she set out to bury each of the fallen Clones despite that they had tried to kill her. She did not blame a single one because they were as much a victim as the Jedi were. Their choice, their freedom, their person gone with a single order. 

Ahsoka new they were good soldiers even after all that. She buried them as good soldiers, giving them honor even after betrayal. Ahsoka showed wisdom greater than many other Jedi by understanding that they were good soldiers corrupted by an order. They were good soldiers. 

And good soldiers follow orders.

StarWars,"I’m beginning to slowly get tired of Star Wars for the first time ever (28M). The fanbase has become so toxic. Personally, I love ALL of the movies and TV shows. Sequels, prequels, original trilogy, Mandalorian, Clone Wars, I love it all! I’ve got posters, t-shirts, and have a shoebox filled with my old toys. But I don’t even want to share my opinion or talk about the franchise anymore to basically anyone. If I dare express my opinion on which movies I enjoy more than others (yes I love them all, but of course I’ve got my own ranking of most to least favorite), a full forced attack comes out from a bajillion people. If I say the opposite (just to see what happens), the exact same thing will occur. It seems that almost all SW fans feel that they personally own it and if it doesn’t meet their EXACT standards, the movie/show is shit. And all I’m left here thinking is, “I hope they realize that these movies are pretend and their target audience is children.” It sucks. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and shouldn’t be chastised for it. Civil discussion and respect for different opinions is key in any debate. Want to know what I did to celebrate yesterday?

So that is a very good thing Disney actually did. Rebels, Fallen order and the inquisitors fit so much better in Star Wars 

2. Ahsoka’s character is so well written, and so massively loved, the only death her character can have now, that is acceptable for her character, is natural causes/old age like Yoda.

I loved all of them, and things like “poor” animation or “boring” stories that the show “suffered” from early on never bothered me. Even watching Season 6 and now Season 7, I still get that magical sense I got watching the movie and first few episodes.

StarWars,"After the disappointment of the sequels, if it could be redone what would your story be instead?

My story (thought up just now so bear with) 

Episode 7 - The Empire was defeated, what was left of the empire split into minor factions, a ""New Republic"" has been established. Leia is in a prominent position. The inquisitors are your antagonists with a fleet of star destroyers, they act like pirates/vikings making raids on new republic worlds. (Also searching for Sith artifacts during raids) 
Luke has set up his own academy determined not to repeat the mistakes of the jedi. Instead of jedi they are called ""Skywalkers"" and they are neither light side nor dark side, but a perfect balance of the force. It's a place where anyone can learn the force if it calls to them. Leia is also trained as a skywalker and her son Ben Solo is trained too. However he begins to show more curiosity in the Dark side of the force. 
The new Republic decides to send some men to deal with the inquisitors and stop an impending raid. Ben Solo elects himself to go and prove himself as his uncle once did. Whilst there he has a confrontation with the inquisitors and the their storm troopers. (Epic lightsaber battle ensues) but when he finds out they are searching for sith artifacts, and their history (trained by darth vader) he decides to join them and learn about the dark side. 
When Luke finds out what has happened he assumes he has been kidnapped. Both Luke and Leia and other members of the skywalker academy (a young girl called Rey among them who was padawan to Ben Solo) , along with a small swat battalion of new Republic soldiers (Finn being one of them) to chase down the inquisitors and ""rescue"" Ben, to do this they need Han as he knows that area of space better than anybody. 
Han and Leia split some years after return of the jedi and he's basically James Kirk of the star wars universe now using his space hero status to bang aliens left right and centre. However he has his own troubles, he is currently being hunted by bounty hunters (he doesn't know why as its not money related) thinks it might be to do with death of Jabba?? Turns out it is Boba Fett who wants him dead. 
Anyway basically abit awkward for both Leia and Han but it unites all the main characters from the originals together including Chewie for a rescue mission. 
They ward off the bounty hunters chasing Han, confront the inquisitors where they are startled to learn Ben Solo has joined them. Luke Skywalker is badly injured, they all escape but are left stranded in space as their engines were damaged. Sitting ducks for Boba Fett and his bounty hunters to capture them...end of episode 7
Or something like that! 
Episode 8 they are made to participate in Boba Fetts deadly games. They sent a distress signal and are rescued by Lando, Ben Solo bids to reunite the old empire factions but has to defeat the leader of the knights of Ren, convince generals to join him, episode 8 is about him doing different tasks and battling to unite them all. Eventually raising to the top, being leader of the inquisitors, the Knights of Ren, and all the remaining storm troopers. 
Leia trains at the skywalker academy, Rey believes she can reach Ben, (maybe?), Rey is sent on a mission to receive a powerful force object and is tested in her own way. Luke is in a ""one with the force"" coma recovering, seeing visions, speaking with force ghosts and the like. 
Peace talks are held between the new Republic and Ben Solos army, with both sides preparing for a trap.
Reys journey leads her to Ashoka??

Episode 9, I dunno... big space battle between the two sides, luke returns from his coma more powerful than ever, Kylo Ren and his inquisitors/pirates/knights of Ren attack the capital hold them hostage, Ashoka, Rey, army of skywalker jedi attack, loads going off, Luke returns and kicks ass, I don't know I'm making all this up as I go along 😂",Rewrite the sequel trilogy - what's your story?
StarWars,"I got into Star Wars pretty late, around 2011 when I was 20 years old. When I watched The Phantom Menace for the first time, I knew from Queen Amidala’s first scene that she was played by Natalie Portman, because she’s famous and she’d just won an Oscar for Black Swan. For the same reason, I also realised that whenever Keira Knightly was playing Amidala, it wasn’t the same person, and I assumed it was either a really bad stunt double or it was meant to be a decoy in the story. Once Padme appeared for the first time, also played by Natalie Portman, I worked the whole thing out and saw straight through the decoy, so the big reveal toward the end was meaningless to me because I’d already guessed it.

But, it’s clear that I wasn’t meant to guess it. Lucas seems to have gone to an effort to disguise the decoy thing, putting Amidala in a lot of makeup and switching Padme and Sabe pretty much every other scene. The whole reveal is clearly meant to be a dramatic twist, with the added humor that Qui-Gon saw through it the whole time. Plus Natalie Portman wasn’t that well-known in 1999, her biggest role up to that point was in Leon: The Professional, and she was just a kid in that. 

So my question is, for those who saw this movie in 1999, was the decoy thing actually a twist? Or did you guess it earlier in the movie?",Question about the whole Padme decoy thing
StarWars,"I feel like this is never really mentioned when people are commending *or* criticising the sequels, Idk maybe people don't pay as much attention to the duels as I do. 

Each trilogy had its own style. The OT duels were slow, careful, paced, and elegant, except for a few exceptions (like Luke's burst of anger after Vader taunts him about Leia in ROTJ). Then you have the prequels, which are flashy, acrobatic, and almost like some superhero fight. They go beyond anything you could recreate IRL, and give it all an air of fantasy and glamour. 

But the sequels also have their own distinct styles. Contrary to the OT, they're much more sudden and erratic. The strikes of each lightsaber are forceful and passionate. But they're also a lot slower than the prequels, but in return, the lightsabers feel so much heavier. Each strike has so much weight and strength in it, unlike the prequels where you'd be convinced the lightsabers all weighed about a gram and get flung around like a roll of paper.

The duel between Rey and Kylo in Rise of Skywalker is I think the pinnacle of this, and one of the most underrated duels in the franchise. It's passionate, weighty, violent, and just feels so on-edge, as though every hit could be the one that kills someone. Personally, I absolutely loved it, and the rest of the duels in the sequels, and I wish they all got a bit more love.",I feel that there isn't nearly enough love for the lightsaber combat in the sequels
StarWars,"This is not going to be a popular post. I know many of you enjoy the clone wars, and I do from time time aswell, but i'd really like it to be removed from canon and just seen as a side piece to the main plot &amp; canon lore. The Clones personality in this show defies the whole expendable clone army point made in attack of the clones, and if they weren't ment to be expendable, why not just use humans? It would be the same as now, only not everyone has Jangos face, they could still be cybernetically alterted to create things like the bad batch, it's a sci fi after all. I don't like the whole thing about the inhibitor chip, as the whole point is that the army bred for the republic recieves an order from the head of the republic, an order even most Human military men would follow. There would be few defections, and I mean FEW, like maybe 1 or 2, who would either be killed or hunted. When in war, and the highest in command gives and order you follow them, without question. That is what it is like to be in the military, so why would clones, specifically bred to serve as the army of the Republic need chips, when most humans wouldn't? The order is code-numbered 66 &amp; all the clones know what this order is, it is probably set there as an ""safety issue"" for the republic, and kept hidden from the jedi, as, ofc, they would most likely have something to say about it. Clever. The Jedi couldn't even sense the sith sitting right infront of them, so ofc, they didn't know about the order either. Order 66 - Terminate the jedi. Military units, clones or otherwise, would execute.

StarWars,"From the very first scene to the 2nd to last scene, the entire clone wars series has taken place, well, in the clone wars.

I would love to see if they took the series tittle literally, and then release a new series that takes place during the empire.

Now I know Rebels exists, but its different. Between the animation and story telling, its different. unlike Rebels, I would be SO cool to have a ""clone wars"" style show that follows the stories of Luke, Leia (maybe as a Jedi?), Han solo, Yoda , Ahsoka etc. Not to mention the main antagonist, Lord Vader. Iconic character from live action films turned to top tier cinematic animation with countless new stories to tell, EXACTLY what the clone wars did. 

As far as what timeline it would be set in, honestly, I wouldn't care. It could follow Luke &amp; original character between episodes 4&amp;6, it could follow Ashoka &amp; Rex right where we last saw them, If I had to chose, Preferably between episodes 5&amp;6 (like how clone wars follows 2&amp;3).

We all saw that final scene, and just that one scene removes all doubts that Dave &amp; his team could do an amazing job.

Just imagine, ""Star Wars: Empire"".

StarWars,"For what J.J. Abrams worked with from episode 8, he created a GOOD movie, maybe not the best Star Wars movie of all time, but for what it's worth it certainly made lemonade out of lemons, coming from episode 8, Abrams did the best with what he had.

Everywhere from the scene with kylo changing to ben solo, from the uniting of Rey and Kylo to face Darth Sidious, and even all of the funny one liners from C-3PO. The movie had everything we could have asked for from the bad plot of Episode 8.

Now I know that some of the scenes especially the end ""Skywalker"" scene was cringe... But overall it was a great movie, and a great Star Wars movie at that. The music was blended perfectly for all of the scenes, the plot of good vs. evil, was great, and it showed that we all might not choose where we come from but we choose who we are!

StarWars,"I was rewatching TROS to celebrate May the 4th and was wondering if there was an in-canon explanation for the final Ben Solo and Rey scene. 

As far as my understanding, when a force-sensitive user (that has been “trained”) dies, their physical body disappears as they enter the cosmic force and become a force ghost (ie. Clone Wars Season 6). This has occurred several times already including Ben Solo, Luke, Leia, etc. 

However in the climax of TROS, Rey dies after defeating Palpatine and her body does not disappear. This was not initially surprising and after Ben Solo uses force healing to resurrect her - I was surprised his body disappeared (implying he will become a force ghost). 

Outside of being a Skywalker by blood, why would this occur without any formal training? It appears at Ben and Rey shared a lot of the same abilities as part of the force dyad so why would he have this ability while she does not? It seems like a convenient plot point to ensure that Rey would not be able to use force healing to resurrect him. What are your thoughts?",TROS Force Ghost Question

4. The protagonist flies away to the remaining friends. Makes a big ass speech about courage, valour and overcoming odds.

If they can do all of that then why not give the average joe the abilitt to use the force? And I'm that same note. 
Question#2. The ancient sith lord momon bound his soul to his helmet, so is it possible to fill an object with the force?

StarWars,"Mild spoilers for Siege of Mandalore.

Order 66 was meant to be an order from an authority Ranking higher than a (Jedi) General, to execute the Treasonous Jedi. It was meant to be for people like General Krell. Had the 501st contacted a higher ranking authority, they had the grounds to Execute Order 66 in the case. 

Now, the thing is, the only people we know to have higher authority than a Jedi General in the Clone Command Structure is the Chancellor Himself. 

Now, let's look at what happened with Siege of Mandalore. Unprompted, The Jedi authorised a Siege on a Neutral planet, with the best justification they have being capturing Maul. (A personal matter to the Jedi. Nothing of concern to the republic)

With that they broke multiple peace treaties, AND plunged the republic into another war. Yes, this was an action of just Kenobi and Skywalker, but the rest of the council didn't oppose or disagree with this action. 

That essentially IS an act of Treason, in and of itself.

On top of that, The Chancellor was not given an opportunity to give up his emergency powers. Ki Adi Mundi clearly raises a valid point in the council discussion ""IF the chancellor does not give up his emergency powers."" 

First thing after confirming the war was over, they didn't ask him to give up the emergency powers, but directly jump to arresting him. 

Dark Side users or not, fact remains, the Jedi committed Treason, and the Order was not something most of the senate would disagree with given these two incidents. Palpatine was well within the law doing what he did.",Order 66 Had In Universe Legal justification for being executed
StarWars,"The chosen one is supposed to be the one who restores balance to the force. Anakin restored balance/completed the prophesy when he killed the emperor but since it turns out he failed in killing him then doesn't that mean balance wasn't restored until Rey killed the emperor in the latest movie thus making her the chosen one and not Anakin?

Kind of annoying that her being the chosen one now makes the previous 6 movies redundant but oh well. This trilogy probably shouldn't even exist or be considered cannon anyway.",So is Rey technically the chosen one?
StarWars,"Since Star Wars content is slowing down until fall besides the behind the scenes Mandalorian series (as within the last 2 1/2 months I have started and finished watching all the movies, Clone Wars, Rebels, and seen most of the canon comics), I wanted to give the canon books a go. The only two i'm genuinely interested in are ""Ahsoka"" and ""Dooku: Jedi Lost"" (I'm planning on listening to the audiobooks as Ashley Eckstein reads the Ahsoka novel). Are these books really any good? I see that they have pretty good ratings and so do many of the Star Wars books which in turn had me questioning whether the quality of these books are actually what people say, or if its just the fanbase dismissing decent writing because it is Star Wars or has their favorite character. Now, i'm not expecting nor even looking to get anything near an award winner or modern classic; all I would like to know is if these books, mostly the two i'm interested in, can tell a compelling enough story to entertain this 17 year old. I just recently got into Star Wars and i'm eager to soak in more stories about Ahsoka and Count Dooku; however, PLEASE let me know if these books are childish or have any other major problems. And, if there is another book besides the two that I mentioned that REALLY stood out as a genuinely good read, let me know.",What's your HONEST opinion on Star Wars canon books?

And even in Rise of Skywalker he was somewhat training Ben. And this whole time Palpatine still considered himself a sith as if they never died. Because they didn't. So is Kylo Ren still not considered a sith or am I missing something?.",Is Kylo Ren still NOT a sith?
StarWars,"Sometimes I think they pretend to hate it so they can bandwagon with the ""free thinking"" critics who believe they're some kind of expert and sole decision making body of the fanbase.

They say it's garbage, not even Star Wars, not even part of the saga, that they'll skip it and never watch it, directly attacking those who like the movie. 

Since when did members of the Star Wars community blast so much negativity? It is not supposed to be like this. It's fair to dislike a film, but is it really productive and rewarding to spam entire discussions bringing up truly disgusting words against movies that the young kids of today have been watching growing up, as did today's adults with the PT?

StarWars,"Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . . 

There was a moment in the history of the galaxy that was unlike any other, unlike all the other events that took place. It was beautiful.

The Old Republic was the Republic of legend, greater than any other. No need to know where it was or from whence it came, only to know that . . . it was THE Republic.

Once, under the wise rule of the Senate and the protection of the Jedi Knights, the Republic thrived and grew. It was a haven for all its citizens. But as often happens when wealth and power pass beyond the admirable and attain the awesome, then appear those evil ones who have greed and power to match.

So it was with the Republic at its height. Like the grandest of trees, able to withstand any external attack, the Republic rotted from within though the danger was not visible from the outside. 

Over time, the greed- and control-minded rulers known as the Separatists emerged in the galaxy, and caused massive disturbance. Because of this, the Jedi, along with its Grand Army of clones, were tasked to stop the Separatists from destroying their Republic. 

Eventually, aided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected Chancellor of the Republic. He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic. 

Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor, shutting himself away from the population. Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot-lickers he appointed to high office, and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears. 

Soon after, he turned the Clone army against the Jedi Knights, exterminating them through treachery and deception. He remade the once grand Republic into the Galactic Empire. Having done so, the Imperial governors and bureaucrats prepared to institute a rain of terror among the disheartened worlds of the galaxy. Many used Imperial forces and the name of the increasingly isolated Emperor to further their own personal ambitions. 

However, a small number of systems rebelled at these new outrages. Declaring themselves opposed to the Empire, they vowed to restore the once great Republic.



Now, the Empire is dead, the Death Star destroyed, and C3PO is still seen as a god to Ewoks.

May the force be with you all.","As May the Fourth draws to a close, I would like to share with you a quick recap of the events of the prequel trilogy and beyond."
StarWars," 

Wouldn't it be cool if: (Though I don't think it's correct.)

The Venator that Ahsoka and Rex crashed is actually the SAME Venator found on Zeffo in Fallen Order. The evidence is as such:

1. Both Venators have a shrine to the Clone Troopers that died there. The timeline would be that Ahsoka's shrine would have been messed up by the years of neglect, but the locals would have repaired it because they believed it to be a holy site. Evidenced by the next point.
2. Cal Kestis has a force echo that reads, ""The Villagers built this memorial to the clones on the Venator. If only they knew the truth.""
3. Both planets have snow.
4. Cal has a force echo that says, ""The ship crashed long ago, but there was a survivor, someone who understood the force. Most likely a padawan. He was injured."" This quote is evidence that he is not always sure who the people were in his echos. Therefore, the ""he"" could have been Ahsoka.
5. One of Cal's visions on the Venator is him hearing the Clone's receive order 66. He hears a clone saying, ""Oh, it's a transmission from the chancellor."" This could have been a vision of the exact moment the clones turned on Ahsoka.

Even though the evidence is weak AND there is evidence that they are two separate wrecks, it is awesome to see such a similar story in two different aspects of the Star Wars universe.",[SPOILERS] Clone Wars - Fallen Order connection theory
StarWars,"As much as I love watching the original trilogy, I have to admit that the visuals are dated. This might make it hard for some people the original trilogy. However, I don't want the original trilogy be full on replaced with a new live-action. I think it would be a fun experiment to see the original trilogy done in the Clone Wars (2008 to 2020) animation so we have a fresh spin on the original trilogy with the same character appearance. It would also help keep the original trilogy timeless.

I am interested to read the responses.",Should the original trilogy be remade with the Clone Wars animation?
StarWars,I know the clones had accelerated growth and would die in a relatively short period compared to regular non clones. But why not just keep making he Kaminoians keep producing clones? Wouldn’t that be easier than recruiting regular citizens of the galaxy to be in the Empire? I thought I remember reading somewhere that Jango Fetts DNA strand was being worn out and that’s why they stopped but they could’ve just got someone else to be the host. Is there a canon explanation for why clones were not used anymore?,Why didn’t Palpatine keep using clones?
StarWars,"I’d like to start out by saying that there’s never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan. I don’t care if you love or hate a certain trilogy, anthology, game, book, comic, or merchandise decision. We’ve gotten more content in the past 5 years than ever before, and I’m happy I get to be apart of it. Anyways, onto my thoughts. I’m sure this is a sentiment that’ll be echoed for years to come, but… I’ve been thinking a lot about the sequels, and my indifference for them is kinda subsided. I think that, objectively, they are all good popcorn films. You can sit down, turn off your brain, and enjoy them. They’re not great as a trilogy, but I can still watch them and get that rush of nostalgia for Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, and Lando whenever they pop in. I wish Rey, Kylo, Finn, and Poe had gotten some better development over the trilogy, and I wish that the story wasn’t so disjointed at times. But no one is forcing me, you, or anyone to watch it if they don’t want to. 

I do think that the directors could make some great Star Wars films if the tones and themes they introduced were part of anthology movies. I think that Rian Johnson, love or hate TLJ, could probably make a really competent Star Wars one-shot like Rogue One or Solo. (Give him a shot and watch Knives Out) 

And then we have the Clone Wars, The Mandalorian, Rebels, and all the upcoming shows. I really think this is where the future of SW belongs. Live action or animation, I don’t care, I just want weekly installments of a badass story that makes me feel like a kid again. 

TLDR: Ultimately, I’ll always prefer the OT as a fan, but the prequel era is what I grew up on. The sequel trilogy, to me, is like the server asking if I have room for dessert. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t. No matter if I do or don’t, I can sit and enjoy something that’s a little shorter and just as filling week after week.

I thought I'd choose one from each trilogy:

Prequels: I liked the banter between Obi Wan and Anakin during the opening of III. Having seen clone wars now, it brings kind of a new light or I guess depth to their relationship since they don't really work together much in the movies. 

Originals: I feel like its hard to pick a moment that is lowkey from the OT since its all been talked about already but I guess I'd go with seeing that shot of Luke's face after seeing his parents killed. That small head turn he does to look away but then looking back at his home right after was something I didn't really appreciate as much until recent. The whole moment felt just felt really well put together by everyone.

Sequels: In TFA, that sequence of a resistance ship mowing down the first order only to find out it was Poe who turns out survived is something I never get tired of watching.

StarWars,"I believe star wars is better now that it’s ever been. The things they are making are really quality entertainment. They dropped the finale for clone wars and it was fucking insane; the mandalorian was an amazing exploration of the galaxy, with a completely expressionless and nearly mute character as the protagonist which somehow manages to show more nuance and emotion through his acting than some of the characters in the sequel trilogy, and IMO rogue one was one of the best SW movies in recent years. So why is it that SW can’t manage to maintain the same level of quality for their main trilogy (which is what everyone sees even the people who aren’t that into star wars) as they have for their shows and spinoffs? I don’t understand it… you’d think they would want to make their MAIN PRODUCT BETTER than the stuff they have on Disney+ and their spinoff movies, since you know… it’s their main product. Does anyone know what caused this? Why their other stuff is so great while their main movies are just meh? I’m not saying I HATE the sequels, I really don’t, at least not as much as some ppl on the internet, but you are objectively wrong if you think they are better than Clone Wars, The Mandalorian or Rogue One, they’re just not. But they should be, they’re the face of Star Wars in the mainstream, so why aren’t they the focus of the studio? What went wrong?

I feel entirely different emotions than I did during Endgame, and that's exactly how it needed to be. The connection to Ahsoka and Vader in their final scenes was incredible.

These details don't matter.

When it comes to Rex being on Endor, I am genuinely surprised whenever I see people who feel the need to argue that the old man in Han's strike team in Return of the Jedi hasn't been retconned to be Rex.  Because that is clearly the intent.

Nik Sant is a fucking background character who was jokingly named after Santa Claus.  Why are people so slavish to details and so reticent for retcons for things that don't matter?  When the first images of Rex in that outfit were released, people were so excited.  Filoni's intent was clearly to have him on Endor, and even had a line mentioning it in the finale.

StarWars,"Ofcourse the title ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is meant as a little plot twist, as it made the audience (or atleast me and my friends) assume the movie would be more heavily surrounding Kylo Ren rather than Rey. As you already know the point was Rey takes the name Skywalker in the name of Leia. On a Side note, In my opinion this ruins Reys Character Arc because what is led to believe is that Reys adventure through the movies is to find out who she truly is, much like Luke, but rather than Excepting she is the relative of a mass murderer and one of the most evil forces in the galaxy, she disregards it which misses her whole objective. But I digress, As we know Anakin was a child of the force and the chosen one. The one meant to bring balance to the force. The Jedi believed this to be by getting rid of the sith, but as we saw it was the opposite and rather inadvertently getting rid of the Jedi to balance the Jedi to Sith ratio therefore balancing the force by leaving only 2 Jedi (Obi Wan and Yoda) and two sith (Him and Palpatine) but we quickly realize he made a new Jedi being Luke which left the force unbalanced once again. Then Darth Vader dies trying to kill Palpatine, but now we know it didn't work so he left 1 Jedi and 1 Sith once again balancing the force but we learn in the Force Awakens that there are more Jedi that Luke then goes on to train and once again inadvertently making another sith making the force unbalance. Rey then becomes all the Jedi as Luke states and then by killing Palpatine she becomes all the Sith. Youd think this would bring balance back to the force but yet she chooses a yellow lightsaber, being the color of the Jedi guard, yet again leaving everything messed up. If instead they had Kylo, or made Rey a real Skywalker, be the one left and had gone through with Kylos plan to get rid of good and evil and just be the force, it would have fulfilled Anakins prophecy by balancing the force through his decadents which I think would have been purely poetic.",The End of the Rise of Skywalker wasn't as powerful as it could have been
StarWars,"Just finished the OG trilogy. Trying wrap my head around what Lukes plan was in Return of the Jedi.

Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewbacca, and R2 all sitting around the digital chess board on the Falcon.

Luke: Ok first, Lando is going to go undercover for reconnaissance. Just blend in and whatever you do, don’t give me any information on any traps that you might encounter. 

Lando: Ummm, alright Luke are you sure? 

Luke: Yeah, I’m a Jedi Master now. I’m literally strong enough to pull the ears of gundark with my bare hands at this point. Trust me this is going to work.

Lando: Well, what if there’s like a huge pit with like a 75 foot dinosaur creature? 

Luke: Imma fight it with bones and rocks. Shits gonna be Lit Fam. Trust me, this is going to work! 

Lando: Ok, Bet. So, just blend in and don’t do anything. 

Luke: Precisely, you’ll know when to awaken from your sleeper cell when I give you a head nod. Leia, I’m going to need you to start learning Ubese. At least enough that you can haggle. 

Leia: Wait, what for?

Luke: Were going to sell Chewbacca to Jabba. 

Chewbacca: RAWRGWAWGGR!!!

Luke: Dude, calm down. It’s literally the same play we ran on the Death Star a few years ago except we getting paid.

Chewbacca: (Wimpers) rwarggr

Leia: So, Jabba speaks Ubese? 

Luke: No, he doesn’t. That’s why I’m sending R2 and 3PO in first to get captured so he can translate for you. You gotta sell it though. These mob boss types don’t respect common traders so you’re going to have to threaten him. 

Leia: So, point a gun at him is what your saying.

Luke: Nah, they’d gun you down faster than the Falcon does the Kessel run. Pull out a grenade and right before it blows up he should cave.

Leia: What if he doesn’t cave? 

Luke: Trust me, he will. Next, wait for everyone to fall asleep. Once everyone’s asleep you’re going to defrost our carbonite popsicSolo. 

Leia: Won’t that trigger an alarm? 

Luke: Probably, either way Han isn’t gonna be in any shape to escape since he won’t be able to see or walk. This is the part where you get captured and become one of his slave strippers.

Leia: WHAT?!!!

Luke: Trust me, this is going to work. Also, you’re going to need to start bumping up your cardio and cutting out all carbs, Jabba don’t mess with fatties.

Lando: So, Chewy and Han are going to be in jail and probably be sentenced to death for ruining Jabbas favorite piece of art and the droids and Leia are going to be turned into slaves. All the while Im acting as a double agent who does nothing until you give me a head nod. 

Luke: Yup

Lando: So, Hans thawed out, everyone’s captured but me, and needs rescued. When do you come in?

Luke: After everyone is captured I come in through the front door incognito style and use the force to choke out anyone who gets in my way. Then I’ll use my Jedi Mind trick to have Jabbas main servant bring me to Him. 

Lando: And then you’ll cut the giant slimy worm in half with your lightsaber? 

Luke: Lol no, R2 is going to have my lightsaber. 

R2: (excited) Beep do do weep beep do.

Luke: Thanks R2, make sure you spring load it and work on your parabola equations like we practiced. Also you can’t tell 3PO any of this plan because we all know he’ll snitch the first chance he gets. 

R2: (Beeps in agreement)

Leia: So, how are you going to kill Jabba and a hundred heavily armed Mercs without your light saber. 

Luke: I’m not going to kill him. This is the part where I get captured. 

Lando: WHAT?!!

Leia: WHAT?!!

Chewbacca: RAWGRWGW!!!!

Luke: Trust me guys this is going to work. Hope you guys like Sand Yachts. We’re going on a desert cruise!",What the hell was Lukes plan to rescue Han?
StarWars,"Ofcourse the title ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is meant as a little plot twist, as it made the audience (or atleast me and my friends) assume the movie would be more heavily surrounding Kylo Ren rather than Rey. As you already know the point was Rey takes the name Skywalker in the name of Leia.
On a Side note, In my opinion this ruins Reys Character Arc because what is led to believe is that Reys adventure through the movies is to find out who she truly is, much like Luke, but rather than Excepting she is the relative of a mass murderer and one of the most evil forces in the galaxy, she disregards it which misses her whole objective. But I digress, 
As we know Anakin was a child of the force and the chosen one. The one meant to bring balance to the force. The Jedi believed this to be by getting rid of the sith, but as we saw it was the opposite and rather inadvertently getting rid of the Jedi to balance the Jedi to Sith ratio therefore balancing the force by leaving only 2 Jedi (Obi Wan and Yoda) and two sith (Him and Palpatine) but we quickly realize he made a new Jedi being Luke which left the force unbalanced once again. Then Darth Vader dies trying to kill Palpatine, but now we know it didn't work so he left 1 Jedi and 1 Sith once again balancing the force but we learn in the Force Awakens that there are more Jedi that Luke then goes on to train  and once again inadvertently making another sith making the force unbalance.  Rey then gets rid of the Sith and Jedi and only leaving herself with the force which is shown by her ""colorless"" lightsaber. If Rey was actually a Skywalker, or If Kylo was the one left alive and became just a force user like Rey did instead, this would have been way more powerful in my opinion.  This would have meant Anakin was the really the chosen one and truly balanced the force through his descendent, but they instead chose to have this pseudo-Skywalker do this which makes it feel less Genuine.",The end of the Rise of Skywalker was as powerful as it could have been.
StarWars,"I'm not saying it was perfect, but I loved The Last Jedi...

Specifically, I loved The Last Jedi for where I thought it was taking the franchise. Which is why I'm pissed all over again after rewatching TROS.

After TLJ, I thought the SW universe was evolving in a thoughtful, new direction that began to flesh out parts of The Force mysticism in ways that felt more nuanced and real (And less David Copperfield-ish, sorry prequel Anakin).

The allegory of individual spirituality versus organized religion and the struggles we have with trying to impose a binary dogma onto a natural world that is neither good nor evil was GREAT. The Tolkien-esque “even the smallest person…” sentiment made TLJ and Rogue One incredibly compelling and heartfelt. I freaking cried at both those movies. 

This new world that would be post-Jedi, post light vs dark was so interesting. (It's the Jedi Reformation, sorta!)  TLJ got me giddy for the future of SW....

And I just re-watched The Rise of Skywalker hoping my expectations had just been too high when I saw it in theaters. 

NOPE. What a bore compared to what it could have been. The ending would literally be the laziest old trope ever...if it didn't take such a massive effort of storytelling gymnastics to force-fit it in. FUCK. 

Artists, storytellers, creative people... Have a fucking point of view and follow through with it. Make art for yourself for fucks sake and not the committee of the internet. 

This has been my TEDtalk. The point was really the title. All the rest of this was just a frustrated rant, but thanks for listening!

(Side note, Adam Driver is a national treasure. That man could be reading the encyclopedia and it would be magical AF. )",Storytellers should stick to their guns and ignore the internet.
StarWars,"This will either just get lost on here or nobody will care because this has been talked about many times

I finally got to watch ROS. Unfortunately didn't get to see it in theaters due to schedule conflicts with my best friend(who i see all SW movies with). Decided just to wait until it came out on +. I'm 26 and a big fan of all Star Wars. I love the prequels, Clone Wars, and Rogue One especially. I was a kid during that era.

Overall I liked this movie more than TLJ and about same as TFA

# Things I liked about ROS:

\-I knew Palaptine came back and was interested to see how it was handled. I know it was pure fanservice but I think it was handled well.

\-Rose was much more tolerable in this movie

\-All the jedi speaking to Rey was really cool. Especially that they included Ahsoka and Kanan.

\-I think Kylo's torment and confusion was one of the constant good things in the movies and i think his final transition into joining Rey was done well. From Luke to Snoke to Palpatine people were always thinking for him and he gradually started thinking for himself

\-Lando and the fleet joining the fight was awesome. My thought was the galaxy wasn't about to have another Empire reign

\-More fan service, but I'm glad they showed Leia training with Luke

\-Maybe I'm an idiot but i legit thought Chewie was killed by Rey at first and I was like holy shit Disney let this through?

\-I think overall the acting in these movies was well done. Especially feel bad for Daisy getting so much hate from people who don't like Rey.

# Things I didn't like (just some big things, not gonna nitpick):

\-The kiss was so random. I always viewed Rey and Ben as more of a brother-sister relationship

\-Rey did have some over-powered force abilities, though I didn't think it was as bad or ""mary-sue"" like as many people made her out to be. I think the lightning was some cheesy foreshadowing though

\-I didn't like her calling herself a Skywalker at the end. I just think her remaining as only Rey would have been better, but I understand why they did it

\-Finn still too obsessed with Rey. I was in full support of the Poe-Finn movement but no way Disney letting that fly

\-Knights of Ren were pretty lame after finally getting to see them

\-Maybe I missed it, but where did all the personnel and soldiers in Palpatine's fleet come from? Old Empire people or what

Overall I enjoyed the movie. I know there's a lot of hate and disappointment, but we're stuck with it. I think the thing that hurt them the most was switching directors and JJ just kind of finished it off the best he could with that and the fact that i heard rumors of Disney stepping in and cutting things out of his script.

Hope the comments stay civil. It's just a movie",Finally watched Rise of Skywalker
StarWars,"Happy May the 4th everyone!

I figured since today is Star Wars Day, I'd make a post and say what I like about every Star Wars movie, since this franchise is easily one of my favorites.

1. The Phantom Menace: This movie, despite all the hate it gets, does have a few things going for it. Liam Neeson is always great to see in almost anything, and Star Wars is no different. Darth Maul's introduction here is also consistently fun to watch, and most importantly, John Williams absolutely outdid himself on this movie with Duel of the Fates. 10/10 piece of music.
2. Attack of the Clones: The highlight of this movie, in my opinion, is the arena scene. Other than that, I really like Obi Wan. But who doesn't?
3. Revenge of the Sith: This is my favorite Star Wars movie. Yes, the dialogue and CGI are both really cheesy, but I think the tragedy of this movie is really well done, especially when viewed with Clone Wars Season 7. This movie's instant quotability and meme potential absolutely stands out, and I'm a huge fan of Palpatine in this movie, even if a certain tragedy does tend to get overtold on the internet.  
4. Solo: Looking back on this movie, seeing the subtle tie-ins to Maul's behind-the-scenes work is a really nice touch, and I really liked Paul Bettany's performance in this as well. Other than that, I thought that the train heist was cool.
5. Rogue One: Another personal favorite of mine, going into Rogue One I absolutely expected it to be tragic, but I still was blown away by how well this movie was written. I loved nearly every character's writing in this movie, which really surprised me, and the behind-the-scenes story of this movie makes this movie even better, as do the connections to Rebels.
6. A New Hope: I grew up in the later prequel era, so this movie doesn't have the nostalgia factor that it does for a lot of Star Wars fans. That being said, this movie's plot, while formulaic, tells an incredibly compelling story that has to be appreciated. And even though I can't appreciate this movie from a nostalgic standpoint, I can appreciate the phenomenal world building ANH established.
7. The Empire Strikes Back: This movie is often considered to be the best movie in the franchise, and while it isn't my personal favorite, I still concede that this movie is probably the best. The dynamic of Luke, Leia, and Han being further explored combines the action-based plot with a more interpersonal subplot, making the characters relatable and even more appreciable. And the reveal in this movie also has to be appreciated from a writing standpoint. This movie's ending also adds a lot to the movie, showing the heroes lose, and effectively sets up the next.
8. The Force Awakens: This movie has been compared to A New Hope, often criticized for following ANH's formula, which it does, but in my opinion the formula works and the movie shines as a result of it. Adam Driver's performance in this movie shines, and the scenes between Kylo Ren and Han Solo made a compelling story. I also really appreciated Domhnall Gleeson's performance as Hux in this movie, with his speech before Starkiller Base is fired bringing chills almost every time I watch this movie.
9. The Last Jedi: I'm going to start on a controversial note, but I really liked Luke in this movie. Even though Rian's decisions with him get a lot of hate, I do think it works really well with Lucas's so-loved Hero's Journey formula. Other than that, Adam Driver again does a phenomenal job bringing Kylo Ren to life, and I really like his dynamic with Rey. I also think that the visual effects in this movie are the best of the entire franchise, from Snoke's lair to Crait to even Holdo's lightspeed ram thingy.
10. The Rise of Skywalker: Adam Driver is again the highlight of this movie, giving what is in my opinion his most compelling performance of the sequel trilogy. Even though Palpatine's return came out of nowhere, Ian McDiarmid's voice acting is always a delight, and that is no different in this movie.",What I like about every Star Wars movie!
StarWars,"From lines about sand to killing the women and the children, the movie is quotable for all the wrong reasons.

That said, we as an audience have to remember, Anakin is basically a kid. He’s supposed to be 19 years old and has been in training to be a wizard monk for a decade.

He’s also been trained to suppress how he feels and the only person he thinks he loves outside of his own mother he hasn’t seen in a decade.

Anakin isn’t having a mature relationship at this point. It’s puppy love like your average high schooler would live through. He flirts awkwardly, has uninformed opinions, he even play wrestled her. This could have been a 19 year old on Naboo or in Nebraska. He’s immature and the pure cringe from watching padawan learner dating is almost understandable. I somehow doubt there was a Jedi sex education class so we should be grateful we were spared Padme having to give Anakin “the talk.”

The movie is also necessary because we need to see Anakin:

1) Develop an unhealthy attachment after years of not having anything 

2) React when he loses his first and only other attachment i.e. his mother. His homicidal rage portends what happens when he loses something he loves. He acts irrationally with no regard for anyone else.

With her gone, all he has left is Padme. When he thinks she betrays him, we saw what happens. When he thinks he killed her...yikes!

Is it my favorite? No. 

But does it serve its specific narrative purpose? I think it does that very well.","Unpopular opinion: Although very cheesy at times, Attack of the Clones was a necessary film for exactly the reasons people hate it"
StarWars,"The two of them and their three daughters (aged 4, 6, and 7) had never seen any of the movies or shows. But they recently went to Disney World in early March and were intrigued thanks to the quality of the Galaxy’s Edge portion of the park. 

So, on April 7th, the embarked for a galaxy far, far away. After some initial discussion, and because of the age of the girls, they decided to start with Episode I since it’s a bit “lighter” to rest of the girls would like it and gauge their reactions to the intense scenes. THEY LOVED IT.  They followed with Episode II, Rogue One, and then straight through IV - VIII whenever they could find the time as a family to watch a movie together. 

The kids have been making homemade spaceships and lightsabers and can’t stop talking about ideas, playing out different scenes, and dreaming about their hopeful next visit to Disney. 

Well, how fitting... unknowingly they found time today to close out the series. They all watched Episode IX today - in Star Wars day! - and are fully in love with the whole series. 

It’s been so fun introducing a whole new crew to the the SW universe. The conversations have been great and they’re totaled hooked! Clone Wars and Mandalorian are next up...

The above are from Wookiepedia, but Vader heals himself in the novels of the OT.","For those that complain that ""Force Healing"" was not a thing..."
StarWars,"Not really spoiling anything here but we're talking S7 so spoiler tag.

So, I've seen people throw around the fact that budget made a difference. Whether or not the budget was actually higher, I have no idea. I'm wondering if anyone can do a breakdown, not only of budget, but of animation technology in general that made season 7 look so much better?

I noticed depth of field looked a lot better. I don't know if it's that they had time to do a better DOF pass, or maybe didn't have the tech before. Also, something in the way light is rendered, especially the highlights?

And of course, there's the mocap that made the movement during specific scenes look waaay better. But the animation, in general, did seem more refined. Anakin's hair, for example, had a movement to it that looked better than usual. 

Anything else people know of? I'm so curious because the art style was something I always actively disliked. I mean, no matter how good the story got, I couldn't stop thinking ""if only this was 2D or live action"". I didn't enjoy visuals of lightsaber fights or any of the character expressions because they felt so stiff and lifeless. It did get better in later seasons, but it's like a threshold was crossed for season 7 that took it from barely passable to *great.* And I'm dying to know how that threshold was passed!","At a technical level, what made TCW Season 7 look so much better?"
StarWars,"Look at Maul in the last episode. Even though he is famous for his double-lightsaber, I think it was really ballsy for them to make Mauls final scene in the Clone Wars be an example of how powerful he is WITHOUT his lightsaber. I mean, look at what he was able to do - he could rip off the walls and use them as shields, and then use those same pieces to cut Clone Troopers in half, use their own blasters against themselves, and PULL APART A FREAKING HYPERSPACE DRIVE TO PULL A SHIP OUT OF HYPERSPACE. That was a great way to show how powerful Maul truly has become - he doesn't even need his lightsaber anymore to kick ass.   

And to be honest, I don't think Yoda and Palpatine, at their current levels of power, really need lightsabers. I think they are strong enough that they could be perfectly fine without their lightsabers - I mean, we kinda saw that in the final battle between Yoda and Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith, as well as in Return of the Jedi.","Even though we all love lightsaber fights, I think Jedi or Sith without lightsabers who only rely on the force to fight have more room for creativity, and for some, might even be stronger without a lightsaber."
StarWars,"I think, or am choosing to think, that the final scene takes place after their fight in Rebels. Vader igniting the lightsaber to me is a sign of recognition. We almost never see Vader even acknowledge that he used to be Anakin, but at this moment he does that and shows he remembers Ahsoka. I hope this scene is after their fight and he has come to this place almost as an admission of guilt. When he ignites the lightsaber I think that it is the first step into redemption. I like to think that Ahsoka's presence started to soften up Vader, and Luke appearing so soon after this finalized the return of Anakin.",Final Scene Thought

StarWars,"This has bothered me for years, and today, being the Fourth of May, I thought I'd clear something up.

In the presence of a large gravitational object, like a black hole, the closer you are to the body, the shorter the trajectory of your orbit, but the faster you have to go to maintain that short trajectory. This means that your ability to take a shorter path is because you were able to go faster.

You see this every day.

Satellites in low Earth orbit (400ish km) can complete their orbits in ~90 minutes. At ~35,786km  above the planet, a satellite orbits at almost exactly the same speed the Earth rotatees and stays directly above one spot (remaining 'geostationary'), and takes the same time; 24 hours. The Moon orbits once every 28ish days... at 300,000km distance.

Those low altitude satellites, taking the substantially shorter path than the moon, move in excess of 7.8km/s, while the Moon orbits at a leisurely 1km/s.

In the presence of intense gravity, speed and distance become synonymous.

Enter the Kessel run.

The Kessel spice run was originally described as a spice run through ""the Maw"" a super large collection of black holes all orbiting relatively near each other. When you made the run, you could go the long way, taking large radius orbits and paths around those immense gravitational objects, and add a ridiculous amount of distance to cover, forced to take this slow, painfully long route, taking substantially more time, because your POS star-ship was a slow moving garbage scow.

Or, if you were lucky, you could take the shortest trip possible, passing supper close to those black holes, without fear of falling into them, the total length of your path now less than 12 parsecs, all because you were the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy, your speed keeping you from dying.

Making the Kessel run in 12 parsecs was bragging about being amazingly, incredibly fast, but in the technical parlance of a guy who knew what he was talking about to other space ship captains and pilots who also knew what he meant.

That's why Obi-Wan looks impressed (a former star-fighter pilot) when Han makes that claim, but Luke, who'd only ever flown speeders, doesn't.",12 Parsecs; a rant.
StarWars,"So I'm watching all the star wars movies in order, may the 4th be with you, and I'm watching mace windu duel with Palpatine. Mace Windu  brings with him 3 other Jedi. I've invisioned the narrative he has with the jedi he takes with him.

StarWars,"I know the actual Order is specific to Jedi and that they have turned on the Republic and tried to take over themselves but what happens on planets that don’t have Jedi? I know that’s probably unlikely as they were generals and commanded the clone army but like with Mandalore in Clone Wars what did the contingent of clones do there? Did they attack Mandalore because they were allied with a Jedi or did they attack because they weren’t allies with the Republic or did they not attack? I feel like they did attack but I’m wondering what the reason would be specifically. And of course Mandalore did end up under imperial control after they sieged the planet but was that the same battle as this one or a later battle where it would have been with more troops against the mandalorians? It didn’t look like there was a huge number of clones in the episode but there also weren’t many mandalorians either. 

Also in Revenge we see the clones attacked the Wookies but why? Yoda, Tarful, and Chewie weren’t involved as they were probably trying to avoid detection getting Yoda off planet and it didn’t look like the Wookies had any communications between each other, such as radios or anything like that, so they couldn’t tell them that the clones had turned. But what reason would the clones have anyway to attack their allies? The droids wouldn’t have been turned off or given orders to stand down until Anakin went to Mustafar to kill the leadership, I don’t think anyway. 

All the planets would end up being controlled by the empire anyway so it probably doesn’t matter if it was Kashyyk or Ryloth, or Mandalore and that the imperial army would have come in to take them but having the clones do most of the dirty work made it easier. Still just something I would like to know that I haven’t been able to find any definitive answer to since Order 66 was about the Jedi and Jedi collaborators and not focused on friendly planets to the Republic.",Does anyone know if Order 66 also included planets that were allied with the Republic?

StarWars,"This is gonna be a three-part post, btw


TL;DR: The OT tells a lot of great story, PT not as much. ST at first is too much of the OT, then basically useless, then doesn’t feel like Star Wars.

This might be a bit of a lengthy post, so be prepared to read:

#First: The Original Trilogy

The reason why we all love the OT is because it manages to incorporate so much story and action into a (relatively) short time span.

**A New Hope:** Lucas combines the action and story of two movies into one. It is a 2:05 movie about space magic, an evil Empire, and a small rebellion. While so many different movie franchises would make the story of New Hope into two different movies, Lucas makes a giant story fit into one movie. Throughout it, the audience is left wondering about what could happen next, who will do what, and how it is so great. We see tons of action, adventure, and cool space magic. We get to see the farm boy learn of his family, the power in it, the power in him, we see him find friends, see him join a rebellion, and we see him take down a giant, planet-destroying space station. It makes us think that we, we who are just normal people, could take on anything if we just have friends and hope. Most movies would end with the Death Star plans getting into the hands of the Rebellion leaders, or soon before or after. Not with George Lucas.

**The Empire Strikes Back:** The sequel to an amazing and wonderful movie, TESB continues the story, taking place not too long after ANH. Instwad of seeing the same thing as before, or something similar, we see the characters together, on Hoth, preparing to leave and defend themselves because the Empire is attacking. After the battle, Luke goes to Dagobah to receive training from an old Jedi master. He was told to go by none other than his now-dead temporary master, who we see on Hoth. Leia, Han, Chewie, and Threepio go off to find one of Han’s friends who can help. While Luke is on Dagobah, we see some cool things. One such thing, that is funny, is a small, green alien who talks funny. It is soon revealed to be none other than Master Yoda himself. Luke trains, and finds that his friends need his help. He goes off to Bespin. At Bespin, we find Vader and the Empire. Threepio was taken, dismantled, and almost melted down. We see our heroes go through some tough stuff. Han is frozen and taken, and Luke fights Vader. The audience is surprised to find out that Vader is Luke’s father. Instead of joining his father, Luke intentionally falls down the huge shaft they are in. He is rescued by Leia, Chewie, and Lando, and they go off, Luke and Vader connecting through the Force. It ends with Luke’s hand being replaced by a more robotic hand.

This movie has a wonderful story, and great twists. It is no wonder why it is loved by so many fans.

**The Return of the Jedi:** I will make this shorter. Just like the rest, it tells a great story with great action in a 2-hour timespan. We meet the cute little Ewoks, see a battle between the Rebels and Ewoks versus Vader’s personal legion of stormtroopers, the 501st. Luke meets the Emperor, and battles with Vader. We see Lando fly the Falcon into the Death Star, and see Vader turn on his master, throwing him down a shaft into the reactor of the second Death Star, which is destroyed soon after. It is revealed that Leia is Luke’s sister.

A massive Empire is taken down, a powerful and evil ruler is destroyed. Although we are left with a great many questions about what happened before the movies, they end.

That is, until May 19, 1999.","My thoughts on the Star Wars movies, and why we do/don’t like them"
StarWars,"Hey everybody, long time star wars fan here. My earliest days of playing videogames were playing the original battlefront games as well as the lego games on my PS2. Now there's a sale on lots of classic SW games on Xbox, and I'm wondering if anyone has any input to which I should get. The ones on sale that I don't own are

Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Jedi Starfighter, KOTOR, KOTOR 2, Republic Commando, and The Force Unleashed 2. I played all of these with buddies as a kid, but never played through them in their entirety, and remember absolutely nothing from their stories (been dodging spoilers for years haha).

Which games do you recommend picking up? They're all $5 so the only question is the actual quality of the game.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, and May the Fourth be with you!",Xbox One May the Fourth sale suggestions?
StarWars,"At the end of the day it’s just Star Wars without the Sequels you don’t know what happens next, without the Original Trilogy you don’t know what happens next. Everybody who likes Star Wars (most) argue over which trilogy is better. I don’t get it, there is no point of it. People should stop complaining about what is better. Yes, I know it’s other people’s opinions but people just argue with it without dealing that the opinion is just a opinion and there is nothing to fight about. It’s all just a waste of time..",I don’t understand why people hate different trilogies from Star Wars.
StarWars,"So, here’s some context. I wouldn’t call myself a fan, but it’s just such big pop culture that I’ve watched enough of it. 

Currently, I’m doing a marathon of the recent trilogy on Disney+. I’ve even got my little Lando Calrissian Funko pop next to me. (Also got all my “refreshments” with me) 

But to be honest, I ain’t even that into it. I watched the first trilogy... thought it was okay. Empire was great though. 

I watched the prequels, they were god awful. I’ve never seen the Disney trilogy before. 

Basically, I want to understand why do people love about it so much? Is there something that I’m under appreciating about it? 

Basically, I’m giving it a shot. Make me a fan.","Let’s have a conversation, Why do you like Star Wars?"
StarWars,"I know many people are big fans of the prequels and in turn the clone wars and I’m not here to bash that. I’m more interested in putting a new spin on The Clone Wars. (This idea was heavily inspired by RedLetterMedia in their Mr. Plinket review of the prequels) now this change is made to fix one of the biggest issues I have with the prequels. The clones and the clone wars don’t feel impactful. Coruscant doesn’t change during a war where they are apparently running out of money. (I know this is talked about in the clone wars tv show) There’s also the clones, which in the original trilogy aren’t any different than droids. We have no reason to care about them because they seem to be an infinite resource, we’re told in the movies they’re resources are thinning and spreading out across the galaxy but we don’t really see it. (Again I know the clone wars tv show makes the clones much more interesting and like able) in this idea those issues would be gone. Instead of the republic having clones, the Sith would. The republic would instead use able bodied men and women to fight in the war. This would 1, add some diversity to the soldiers and 2, make us feel more for them because they are real people not clones. In this idea the Sith would have the clones. Instead of humans being cloned, they would be some sort of monster from an outer rim planet. There would be foot soldiers that could use blasters or they could be more vicious and use claws to tear apart republic soldiers. There could also be higher up generals that could either be a different alien or not a clone at all. They would be recruited instead. Now since there would be actual citizens of the republic as soldiers we would see a slow collapse of frequented places like Coruscant. That’s pretty much all I have for now but tell me what you think of it!",The clone wars
StarWars,"Hello there,

I finally watched the sequel trilogy in its original audio (english) and since I love learning about accents I noticed something confusing. Finn's actor is English and in all of hos interviews he's got a very British accent. So why is he using and American accent in the film?

In Star Wars most the tendency goes to the Empire (later the First Order) being played by Brits (Vader, the empirial generals, Snoke, Hux etv) and the good ones are portrayed by Americans (Luke, Leia, Han, Poe etc).

Can someone explain, please? Maybe Finn hasn't got an American accent at all but something different? Thanks fpr answering.

StarWars,"I just want to talk about my favourite moment in all Star Wars media. A moment in a Legends novel, where a character embraces their greatest flaw and turns it into their greatest strength. A moment that I find very relatable and personally inspiring in my life. 
Ganner Rhysode, a Jedi Knight who in his own words, was not a hero, just a sidekick, embracing his own inner need to be THE hero, accepts that he only needs to pretend to be the hero, and in doing so provides Jacen Solo with the time to talk to the Dhuryam on Yuuzhan'tar. 

""  I don't have to be a hero, he thought in silent wonder. All I have to do is pretend. ""Like I said, I'm just the sidekick here,"" he said carelessly. ""My job is to make sure the real hero lives long enough to do his. That whole `needing to be a hero' thing has always been my greatest weakness."" Jacen stared at him, into him, through him, as though he knew him to his very core, and he nodded. ""But you should know that it can also be your greatest strength. Give yourself permission to use that strength, Ganner. You'll need it.""  ""

Ganner becomes a legend to the Yuuzhan Vong because of his actions on that day and provides my favourite quote from legends in the process - 

""No. I am Ganner. This threshold is mine. I claim it for my own. Bring on your thousands, one at a time or all in a rush. I don't give a damn. None shall pass.""",May the 4th always reminds me why I love Star Wars (Spoilers for Legends Novel - Traitor)
StarWars,"I was born in 2002. 
The Original Trilogy is something sacred to me. But I grew up with Prequels. And later with the Clone Wars. It was the most influencial thing in my childhood and I am glad that this chapter of my life is now finished.

I also wanted to thank Dave Filoni and his crew for creating this beautiful show.
Thank you Matt Lanter, James Arnold Taylor, Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, Tom Kane and many other voice actors who I will probably never forget.

StarWars,"After watching the first episode of the documentary about the behind-the-scenes of The Mandalorian, I've realized how much each single director and producer was involved emotionally in the project. Not only Filoni (this guy has so much passion, love and care about Star Wars as no one could, you can see that in his eyes while he's talking about his first interview and meet with George). To be honest I did not expect Favreau also. He's been a leader in the development and as I know this is one of the first projects he is involved directly (correct me if I'm wrong).
To sum up, it was an interesting introduction episode.",The making of The Mandalorian
StarWars,"I know a lot of people have made the same point, but I think it the complaints behind the Matez Sisters arc goes beyond ""It's not good""

My opining is that if you took out the entirety of episodes 5-8 of The Clone Wars Season 7, not only would the series miss nothing, but it would actually make it better. Imagine if in Episode 9 of Season 7, after Anakin saves the day he gets a message from an unknown person only for that person to be Ahsoka. It would be a cool reveal. 

One of my major problems with the Martez Sisters Arc is that they don't do much aside from reintroducing Ahsoka or Maul to the series and having Ahsoka team up with Bo Katan.  I'm also pretty sure there's a time jump between Episodes 8 and 9 of Season 7 so the episodes leading up to that don't really matter

I think if everything Ahsoka did after she left the Jedi Order was left a mystery, then it would be better because we would use our imaginations to learn what happened up to that point. 

Now your probably thinking about what other arc the show could have done. I believe the show should have adapted the comic series **Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir**. The comic was about what happened to Maul after his cliffhanger in Season 5 of The Clone Wars. This would not only reintroduce us to Maul, but would also give an explanation as to how he got back to Mandalore, because if you haven't read the comic, how he escaped from Sidious after Season 5 is given about as much explanation as to how Palpatine came back in The Rise of Skywalker.

Another thing it would do is let us see characters like General Grievous, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, and Mother Talzin one last time before the series is over because those characters were mostly absent from the final Season and it would be great to see them again. It also introduces people who haven't seen Rebels (Like myself) to characters like Gar Saxon. Since I haven't seen him before he was just a random Mandalorian commander. Plus the comic is legitimately great and I suggest you read it

That's my opinion at least",The Martez Sisters arc shouldn't have been made because there is another arc the show could have done instead

I watched the entirety of the show, but I really would like to watch the finale with my family who have seen everything that is live-action Star Wars. They never really wanted to watch the animated shows though.

If I give them the basic information about the show (Anakin has a padawan, Darth Maul is back etc.), will they be able to understand and enjoy these episodes or would it be better to just watch it only with someone who has also seen “The Clone Wars”?",Can you watch the four-episode finale of “The Clone Wars” without having watched any episode of the series before?

Back then when we didn't know that we would get season 7 I watched the unfinished episodes several times. And when they announced season 7 I was so excited to see the unfinished episodes ""finished"". I mean there are so many unused opportunities so many episodes that are waiting to get finished and aired but won't. In the end I think that Disney was under pressure because of the fans and just wanted to finish the series. They never really cared and rushed the series. Don't get me wrong I like season 7 but it's just a small part of what it could have been and that they did it doesn't justify how they did it.

StarWars,"I didn’t want to put the name of the other movie in the title for spoiler reasons. 

But the end of TRoS is the exact same as the end of Avengers: End Game (another Disney property). 

Good guys spend the movie getting information that they need to them fight the bad guy. They ending culminates in a giant fight between the good and the bad guys. Just as the good guys seem outnumbered, the rest of the good guys show up. Through light speed in TRoS and portals in End Game. 

The similarities go all the way down to the last moments when Rey and sidious are fighting. Sidious says “I am all the sith” reminiscent of Thanos saying “I am inevitable” then Rey just goes and says “I am all the Jedi” reminiscent of iron man saying “I am iron man”! And upon beating sidious all the enemies are destroyed, exactly like in End Game. 

I refuse to believe this is nearly a coincident. Disney has always been formulaic in their movies  and it feels cheap to use the same ending in their two biggest franchises. I understand it is supposed to be similar to the ending of Episode 6 when Luke, Vader, and Sidious are in the chamber watching the battle happen outside but damn.",[Spoiler] Are we just going to ignore the ending of Rise of Skywalker is the same as another big movie?

I appreciate and try to enjoy every piece of sw content we get. The cw has the best aspects of every trilogy and tells a story with unrivaled depth and character development. This is a show I will fondly rewatch year after year. It means more to me than the creators could know.",How is it that the cartoon became my favorite piece of Star Wars?
StarWars,"I'm so glad the SW:TCW invested in developing Ahsoka's character more. Ahsoka, has became so much more powerful.  The way she leveled up reminds me of how Goku and the Saiyans of the DBZ universe kept breaking through their upper limits. She uses her abilities in many ways we haven't seen before. Using telekinesis to manipulate her light sabers and drill a hole in the ground so her and Rex can escape. Can you say, Darth Traya? She never demonstrated the ability to almost bring a ship out the sky before. She only stopped when she realized that Rex was about to be killed and at that point no one would be left to defend her from incoming fire \[and she didn't want Rex to die either\]. It reminds me of Star Killer (I think) who was known to bring a ship down and out of orbit. But that wasn't cannon. More recently Rey held a ship in flight, like Ahsoka did, in her attempt to rescue Chebacca but may have done so with an assist from Kylo.

So Ahsoka is at least as powerful as Rey. I would guess more powerful if a timeline exists where they would cross paths. I'm gonna have to say that she is way more powerful than when she was ""officially"" with the Jedi Order.

...and what's up with the owl? I know that's a tie in to an earlier saga involving the force weilders (the Father, Son &amp; Daughter) but was one of them, (the daughter) transformed in to that owl?  


Note: I have loads of screen shots from her epic Battle with Maul.

She has been indifferent to Star Wars and I dont push it so this was a collision of both worlds I want to embrace. I immediately went to amazon and got as many Ahsoka books or padawan books i could find in the 3-5 year old category. They were all used but worked out great. 

However I'd like to suprise her with an ahsoka figure or toy but there are none in stores and the ones I find online are marked up 1000%

StarWars,"Alright so now that we got the finale of the Clone Wars, we have seen some retconning of the “Ahsoka” book. A couple questions I have now from what we have seen:
(Forgive me, it’s been a couple years since I read the “Ahsoka” book so if I have anything wrong please correct me.)

1) Does Ahsoka now head to Thabeska and go into hiding followed by Raada? Does this series really change anything from the book?

2) Will we ever find out what happens to Rex in the meantime (outside from what we know from rebels)?

3) It feels like basically all of her flashbacks from the book got retconned, which I would say is mostly for the better (their capture of Maul in the series was much cooler than a ray shield in the book.) Has anyone from Lucasfilms spoke on this and does this have any affect on the rest of the book in your eyes?

4) She still doesn’t know Anakin is Vader right? I mean we saw her feel Anakin turn, but she can’t feel him in the force anymore in the book. Is that just because Anakin is dead, there is only Vader?

They were ""defective"" clones, so would the Republic even have bothered with putting chips in them, or decide to not waste their time doing it?

StarWars,"Just got done watching the last episode, just a couple quick thoughts. Their were a lot of great moments in the final scene but my favorite was Darth Vader looking up into the sky and you see the dark red hue in his eye and could partially see his eye and skin. haunting to think their's someone human still inside the suite. It made me think of the shot in New Hope when you see Vaders face through the mask. Which Ive never researched but I assumed was a complete accident in the film. Made me wonder if that mistake in the film was the influence for that final shot in clone wars. Not sure if anyone knows if someone connected to the film has ever said anything about that shot? 

Also, new topic, theirs gotta be another series with Darth Vader, right? Gotta go looking for Ahsoka, right? Disneys gotta capitalize on this popularity they have with Ahsoka. And add one of the most popular villains ever. That would be a hit. Especially if they stuck with that serious tone that final scene had.

StarWars,"Today, of all days, I celebrate how Star Wars is getting me through lockdown. On March 11th, I and two buddies of mine made a trip to Disney World in Orlando, FL, for the expressed purpose of going to Galaxy’s Edge. We had been planning the trip for about 3 months, and we traveled from three different states to meet there for that one purpose. We didn’t go to any other park, we were there just for Star Wars. As we got closer to the day, we were worried about how the newly (at the time) growing concern over coronavirus would impact our trip. We chose to push forward anyway (keep in mind, at the time the threat seemed minimal. We made that decision based on the info we had - very few cases in the US, and most on the West Coast. In hindsight, knowing what we know now, it was a horrible idea to choose to go, and we would not make the same choice today). However, that day ended up being the perfect day. We woke up early, got to the park an hour before opening...and when I say we got to do everything we wanted to do, I mean everything. We got Group 8 during the lottery for the Rise of the Resistance ride (for those of you who don’t know, this is incredible. We literally got to ride the ride within an hour of the park opening), we got to build custom lightsabers, we rode Smuggler’s Run, we drank Blue Milk, we stopped in at Oga’s Cantina, and I even got the Legacy Lightsaber I wanted from Dok Ondar’s. Everything that could have gone right went right. We marveled at how lucky we were to literally have the perfect Galaxy’s Edge trip. And, it was the first time we had ever taken a guys trip like this. It was amazing...A few days later, Disney announced it was closing down due to the virus. We returned to our respective home states and we were almost immediately put into lockdown. Since then, I’ve looked back fondly on that day as the last true hoorah before going into quarantine. During lockdown I have, of course, been watching the movies over and over  and catching up on TCW and the Mandalorian, and, to be honest, it’s keeping me from going stir-crazy during this craziness. So, today, I’m grateful for Star Wars. I’m grateful for good buddies who share my passion for this amazing world and its characters. And I’m grateful that we got to spend that one perfect day before being locked in. But, above all, I’m glad we made it home safely, and in good health. Stay strong out their friends.

StarWars,"So, when I was young I wasn't really into all the Star Wars hype and haven't ever really looked back at it. My birthday is today (May 4th) and just like every other year people tell me ""MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU"" and ""The Star Wars day is your bday?? Thats cool!"" only so I tell them that I never really got into it.

So I decided that maybe it's time to actually give it a try now, especially with all the time we have now with Corona going on.

Anyways,  I'm 24 now and (spoiler ahead) I know that Darth Vader is Luke's father. I've known that since elementary school just because Star Wars is so huge and the word goes around. But that's the only spoiler I know.

I read that the general recommendation to watch is Episode 4, 5, 6 into 1, 2, 3 

BUT

since I know that Darth Vader is Lukes Father, I read some other thread that with the knowledge of that, it might be more enjoyable to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

So, please tell me what the best watch order for me would be with this knowledge! Thank you :)",Question about watch order
StarWars,"After watching the last 4 episodes of The Clone Wars, I can't help but think Dave should've been involved on the creative side for developing the sequel trilogy. I know he didn't have any film making experience, but he knows how to tell a story and he could've helped Kathleen and co. to create a narrative plan/arc for the sequel trilogy. He could've worked with JJ and Rian in making sure the story was consistent and respected the lore. It's frustrating to watch the sequel trilogy knowing that there was never a plan and many missed opportunities. Does anyone feel like Dave should've been involved with the sequel trilogy? Also, I hope one day, Dave can make his own Star Wars movie, or even a trilogy.",Why wasn't Dave creatively involved with the sequel trilogy?
StarWars,"Hello fellow Star Wars fans. Today is the annual celebration of everything Star Wars and I hope everyone, despite this whole coronavirus stuff is enjoying it. But I feel like this Star Wars day is an end of a legacy that has been established. Today we saw the last episode of the clone wars released, and TLJ released to Disney Plus. I feel like this truly is the end of the Skywalker legacy in Star Wars. We have  filled every gap with standalone stories and series such as the clone wars and rebels to explain everything in between the movies. Skywalker as we know it has no direct descendants still alive meaning the bloodline is lost. Furthermore the next movies will almost certainly not be centered around Skywalker or his family. I may be jumping ahead here but I think this really is the end of the characters we cherished and loved, if you wanna argue otherwise i'm down to hear other opinions. BTW looking into the sunset while listening to binary sunset from Star Wars is an amazing way to celebrate May 4th.",I feel like this Star Wars day is a historic day
StarWars,"I had thought about this for a while now but the whole Skywalker Saga can be summarized with these three words.

The prequels are about the **Rise** of Palpatine and the Empire.
It's also about the **Fall** of Anakin into the Darkside.

The original trilogy is about the **Fall** of the Empire and ultimately Palpatine himself.
In the end it's the **Return** of the Jedi and Anakin into the light with help from Luke.

The sequels are a bit more muddled but still work as in the end the impending **Return** of Palpatine is the catalyst for the final battle.
In the end the **Rise** of Skywalker brings peace once and for all to the galaxy.


You could also apply these three to the trilogies as a whole.

The original trilogy brings the **Rise** of Star Wars into media 
The prequels at the time were seen as the **Fall** since we thought that was the end for Star Wars but with the sequels and media released since than, we are all seeing the **Return**

It's quite poetic.","The Rise, Fall &amp; Return of Star Wars"
StarWars,"I'm 26 and have never seen a Star Wars in my life. I wanted to start watching them now as I have a bunch of time off but idk what order to watch them in. Apparently you don't watch Episode 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc in order? I looked around and people told me to watch this order:

StarWars,"One of the most interesting what-if’s in Star Wars is that Qui-Gon and Maul likely would have aligned in many aspects ideologically regarding their philosophies on the Force and could have united to be a powerful balance against Palpatine in one direction and the Jedi in the other

Qui-Gon’s grey tendencies and Maul’s eventual realization that he was a disposable pawn could have drawn them together toward the center as competent opposition to both the tyrannical oppression of the Sith and the blinding fundamentalism of the Jedi

Sadly, they were ultimately both acting according to a false binary of light and darkness when Maul killed Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan “killed” Maul

May the fourth be with you... always.","My favourite Star Wars moments, shows + movies"
StarWars,"TL/DR at bottom

Watching Star Wars for the first time in a long time for May the Fourth. I was a HUGE fan growing up. So much so I had the dialogue from the while first trilogy memorized. Generally I've fallen out of love with the franchise over the years, starting with episode 1 (I really liked Ep 7 and Rogue 1 though, but not enough to have seen 9 yet). 

Anyway, I'm watching Jedi and it occured to me how little we knew about Boba Fett from the original movies. He was an absolute fan favorite. Iconically so even. But within the movies you don't really get enough info to find him more than passingly interesting (as a more mature viewer anyway). He has a cool look and job, takes a finger wagging from Vader, does one smart thing in tracking the Falcon and then is relegated to being a transporter and dies comically when he finally tries to spring into action in a fight. He's grade-a certified top henchman stereotype and nothing more. 

Of course, there was also his part in the TV special and the hype over the toy and his huge presence in books and fanfic that would come later, but what I described above is all you'd know if you just watched the movies and personally I wouldn't be very impressed by that if I were seeing it for the first time today. 

As a matter of fact, there are a LOT of characters who have had more or less the same treatment in the other trilogies who I looked at and thought ""ok, why should I care about that person"" or ""what was the point of that?"" There's the General Grievouses (sp?) and Cpt Phasmas and a lot more who I don't remember off the top of my head who younger viewers have REALLY latched on to.

It occured to me, watching Boba Fett, the great bounty hunter, get accidentally pushed into a jetpack misfire and fall to his death in the Sarlacc before he ever did anything effective in the fight he was in, that it was always the potential of the character that made him interesting for me as a kid. That wasn't reliant on what was actually on screen. At its best Star Wars is often a fertile playground for childrens' imaginations. In that way it's sort of like a tabletop rpg -it just gives the foundation and you bring the rest. 

I think that's what fans of the original trilogy did with Boba Fett and other characters and it's what younger fans have done with newer characters in the other movies.


TL/DR: In the original (theatrical release) version of Empire and Jedi, Boba Fett's appearances were so small and lacking in development and his death was so anti-climactic that if I'd seen those movies as an adult I would have thought he was pointless. That realization made me understand why younger fans like characters in newer movies I don't, and that those characters are just as good/bad as ones I like.",Boba Fett just made me appreciate how fans of the other trilogies can be so attached to characters that I don't find interesting.
StarWars,"Seen as it's May the 4th I was just wondering what everyone's favourites in each of these categories are:
Favourite Hero: 
Favourite Villain:
Favourite Anti-Hero (Bounty Hunters, etc.):

For me, my choices would be:
Favourite Hero:   Ahsoka Tano
Favourite Villain:   Kylo Ren (or Maul)
Favourite Anti-Hero:   Din Djarin (I think he'd count)
Favourite Film:   Rouge One: A Star Wars Story
Favourite TV Show:   The Clone Wars (and Rebels)

StarWars,"viewing Clone Wars and Rebels for the first time?

TCW's finale was incredible and made me hungry to re-watch Twilight of the Apprentice. Naturally, I've been religiously recommending TCW to my friends over the past few weeks, and I've finally gotten some to bite. I'm curious as to what the optimal way to watch is, though. 

On the one hand, watching in chronological order gives us a better picture of how the show was intended to be delivered, but I don't think that could replace the intrigue of seeing Ahsoka in Rebels and not really knowing what happened to her during Order 66. I really like that feeling of mystery, and I'm glad I had to watch Rebels before TCW wrapped up.

Thoughts?",[CLONE WARS and Rebels SPOILERS] Would you recommend release order or chronological order of....
StarWars,"Literally Star Wars is the most significant piece of art in my entire life. The purity of the philosophy and logic that go into the first six movies, as well as every Clone Wars episode (also Rogue One), is incredible. The philosophical range and potential of those stories is astounding. Quite simply, Star Wars has allowed me to grapple with huge life questions and the moral ambiguity of human existence. By relying on simple logic that is distilled to its most fundamental level and presented in easily digestible stories, Star Wars has created philosophers out of its billions of fans. 

I spent a significant portion of my college years pursuing my interest in philosophy in more academic settings. However, the ability to freely form original and personal philosophical perspectives is almost solely because of Star Wars.

The Dark Side and the Light Side are not foreign concepts to anyone, regardless of whether or not you know Star Wars. Again, simple logic distilled to its fundamental level. Basically, being presented with Bad &amp; Good, and constantly receiving other bits of logic explaining why different characters make their choices to find their paths. I honestly believe that, due to its scope of reach and cultural significance to this day, Star Wars is one of the most important works of philosophy ever made. Also it's an opera with badass music, so...

Thank you George Lucas, John Williams, Lawrence Kasdan, Dave Filoni, Irvin Kershner, and everyone else who was involved with Star Wars*!!!!!

MAY THE 4TH BE WITH US ALL

*Minus the new trilogy because those are films based on Hollywood plots with capitalist motives. While liking those movies is certainly not wrong, I would argue that they never really captured the true essence of Star Wars. It's a space opera told with amazing music and supported by solid logic.",Thank You Star Wars
StarWars,"Hello, this was surely mentioned somewhere in the discussion thread but I think it is interesting enough for a own post.

So my theory is that Rey is possessed by emperor palpatine at the end of TRoS. 

The most obvious reasons is that he has told her that this would happen. ""Destroy me and I will possess you"" (I watched the movie months ago so I am paraphrasing). And she did destroy him. He could have lied. But he is not the character for that and suffers from ""villain explains his plot syndrome"". He also acts in a way that really shows that he wants to be killed by her.

So he sucks all the juice out of Rey and Ben. Rey destroys Sheev and dies and Ben ""heals"" her. But Ben is all out of power and Sheevs reincarnates into Rey. I mean at this point we already know that force lightning and disintegration isn't able to kill Sheevs since he survived the explosion of the death star.

The last hint is the fact that Rey steals the name skywalker. Rey would not do it, her hole journey was about finding her root and accepting who she is and knowing who she is. Rey would take the name palpatin and own it and Rey would rehabilitate the name by her awesome future acts of heroism. Or she would at least take the name Solo to honor Ben and Han (to which she had a faaar deeper connection than to any skywalker).

Sheevs on the other hand would totally take the Skywalker name to profit from the fame and further disguises his true nature.

This theory is way more fun than the other theory, that most things where not really well written and the plot and story was sacrifice in order to hit a few bullet points. 

It definitely makes more sense that the lackluster official interpretation.",About the ending of the Saga
StarWars,"So I'm a bit on the fence on the subject.

The force was very black and white in original films, with the good side of the force just being called ""the force"" which is the natural order of the universe then you have the specially labeled ""dark side"" which is the unquestionably corrupt version of how the force is supposed to be used by villains. This original system lines up well with the whole hero's journey told in a space opera that the film was going for.

However, over the years interviews with Gorge Lucus muddied things up with him claiming the force had to be in place. We see this show up in the prequels with Anakin fulfilling the prophecy of bringing balance to the force, he destroyed the Jedi leading to only two Jedi and two sith (not that they were good movies). The Jedi were more considered with polticis then with spirituality them to misinterpret 'balance' as defeating. In the clone wars The Father and in The Last Jedi Luke both state flat out that balance in the force is literal.

It seems to me with all this in mind a grey Jedi doesn't make a lot of sense 1) if they are a deeply spiritual worshipper of the force then they would want to distance themselves from the corrupt light and dark force disciplines as much as possible so they would drop the 'Jedi' label  2) If you follow the above you'll see how the 'balance of the force' doesn't really seemed thought all the way through. While this is interesting we, unfortunately, don't see how the light side corrupts people physically and mentally similar to the way the dark side does which really undermines the balance dynamically. 3) Grey Jedi are at the heart of it (in my opinion) a video game mechanic so protagonists can use the force for attacking spells without worrying about turning evil but that disregards how Yoda explains the force work in TESB movie.",How does everyone feel about Grey Jedi

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Episode 8. But it's still Star Wars so I still like it. Solo had a lot of mixed reviews, but personally I loved it. It was an awesome, compelling, and believable backstory to an amazing, super important and beloved character. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and if you don't like some of the movies or shows, that's perfectly fine. But I choose to love every series, movie, game, and book for what they are. Beautiful extensions of the universe and (somewhat now convoluted because the Disney EU murder) continuity of the Star Wars franchise. I'm not a happy hippy with Disney myself, I love the EU so much, and was and am upset when The Mouse just up and killed it, but that's within their rights as its current owners. It's not like their banning it, the stories are right there. This post got a little Rant-like, sorry. But why choose to hate something that's brought so many of us joy?

May the Force Be With You!","Yo, Shout Out to the Sequel Trilogy this Star Wars Day"
StarWars,"Thank you. 

Thank you for introducing us to Ahsoka Tano, who is now one of the most developed characters in all of Star Wars. This show allowed us to see Ahsoka slowly grow from an immature child to a kind, patient, caring person. She was betrayed by the people she was closest to but continued to believe in what the Jedi stood for rather than what they had become. Down to the last episode, refusing to hurt or kill the clones after they turned on her is such a fantastic display of her character.

Thank you for bringing Maul back from the dead and turning him into a fleshed out character with motivation and purpose. We got to see him change from a crazed, revenge driven maniac to a calculated, plotting mastermind who clearly learned a thing or two about complex plans from his master. What was once simply a tattooed badass is now, once again, one of the best characters in all of Star Wars.

Thank you for bringing life and personality to the clones. What were once a nameless, identical mass of soldiers is now a group of people with personality and identity. The Umbara Arc is one of my favorites from the entire show and stars almost entirely clones.

Thank you for showing Anakin Skywalker's friendship with his master as well as his turn to the dark side. This show succeeds where the prequels largely fail. We see Obi Wan and Anakin bond and banter, and giving Anakin an apprentice was one of the best decisions George Lucas had. His relationship with Ahsoka is incredible to watch as it morphs over time, allowing us to see his own internal change.

I love this show and I love Star Wars. I am so glad there is still a piece of this franchise that the entire fanbase can unite around. Whether you love the OT, prequels, sequels, or any combination therein, we are all Star Wars fans in one way or another. This show gives me hope for the future, but it also has made me grateful for what it has given us.

StarWars,"Clone Wars just ended today and all the Star Wars films are on Disney+. I want to watch the final arc of Clone Wars, which occurs alongside Revenge of the Sith, in a way that paints the complete picture. In Clone Wars, Obi Wan and Anakin go off to do what occurs in Revenge of the Sith, and multiple times the show and movie intersect. What I want to do is watch Revenge of the Sith and the final arc of Clone Wars so that I get the whole story at once. My problem is I don't know which to turn on first and when to switch over between movie and show. I know scenes like the holonet conversation with Asokah and the Council happened right after Anakin left the conversation, so I can watch that scene in Revenge of the Sith and as soon as Anakin leaves, put on the same scene's continuation in Clone Wars. I want to do this with the whole Revenge of the Sith film and Clone Wars final arc. Any help on timing this would be appreciated. I read yesterday that someone is editing Revenge of the Sith into a 3.5 hour extended edition including Clone Wars scenes, but I don't think the person making it will release it publicly because of copyright concerns. Because of such, I want to experience it myself on my own.

StarWars,"It's literally like sticking all the people who control the ship, guns, propulsion, hangar bay,and everything else into a few rooms on the top of a, a prominently displayed, relatively thin pole. That too, in a mass produced military grade ship. The venator took care of this to some extent with it's dual bridge design but even then it isn't that secure. Look at the executor super star destroyer in RoTJ. The 19 km super dreadnought was foiled by one stray A wing that hit it in the bridge. They have advanced technology and put it into a raised bridge instead of something like an enclosed bridge that relies on camera feeds or something. I don't know. But why the raised bridge?

StarWars,"The clone wars finale was amazing. I love how it crossed into Revenge of the Sith. It was emotional and amazing. Arguably some of the newer best Star Wars made. But I still have some questions. 

1. Did Commander Wolffe go along with Order 66? Rex said in Rebels that Gregor and Wolfee's chips got removed. To be honest I thought the chips were going to be removed earlier this season or they were going to be removed after Rex found out about what Fives told him. What about Gregor as well I don't understand how he survived the Rhydonium explosion in season 5. Did he go back to the Republic? 
2. How did Palpatine know where Ahsoka was. Did he tell Rex to execute order 66 in general or did he know about the Siege of Mandalore? It was an emotional scene though. 
3. How much time passed when Vader found Ahsoka's lightsabers? 
4. People say a Clone Wars season 8 is coming out or that Lucasfilm has more stories to tell about Ahsoka. Anyone want to explain that? I would be so down for more Ahsoka stories or Clone Wars stories.
5. Why can't Dave Filoni take over Lucasfilm? He's a god when it comes to making Star Wars. He understands the knowledge of George Lucas and the Star wars universe. 
6. How much involvement did George Lucas have with the new season?
7. Is this the last time we are going to see Maul? I thought someone said that after Clone Wars we are going to be taking a ""break"" from seeing Maul for a while since he's been in Star wars so much for the last couple years. I hope we will one day get to see Maul's adventures during the age of the empire. Imagine if he fought Vader. 
8. Did Ahsoka encounter Obi-Wan or Yoda after season 7? I know Ahsoka did a lot of stuff after the fall of the Jedi Order but I haven't read the Ahsoka book. 
9. What happened to the Bad Batch?
10. What are your thoughts on the new season? I loved it and the visuals and story.",Questions I still have.

StarWars,"I just watched the last episode of The Clone Wars and it was so damn good, the whole siege of Mandalore was so good. This coming after Episode IX and once again some controversy like Episode VIII.

But leaving aside the fandom bullshit for a moment, my personal feelings of the last two films were complicated. I think The Last Jedi was directed, acted and executed well and the way it was presented was brilliant and fresh for a Star Wars film and story in general and the character development was top notch. I can say with confidence that I liked it, but I always have to pause a bit before I say I do.

Rise of course is a huge tumble dryer of confusion. It looked cool, it was fun but I feel JJ Abrams was not the right Director for ending the series.

But outside of main films we have had these amazing TV series, we have had a great couple of games (The Star Wars License needs to be spread to other developers not just EA but that's another rant).  The Mandalorian, brilliant. The last season of Clone Wars, brilliant. It is these things that make it feel like a roller coaster you know. Just a crazy ride of highs and lows.

I never want to get off.",Star Wars can be a Roller Coaster sometimes.
StarWars,"1.Maul is kinda overused and I hope he’s finally done.

2.Rebels ruined the end of the Clone Wars for me because Ik where all the characters end up. (I get it tho because they didn’t know that they were gonna get a shot at CW again)

3.I choose to believe Ahsoka died in the temple because that’s where her story should end.  

4.Time travel in rebels is dumb.

5. I choose to believe Ezra also dies before the OT because I don’t like an extremely strong force user being alive when Luke should be the final chance at Vader being stopped/saved.

6.However, I am ok with Cal Kestis maybe living through some of it because he clearly shows he can’t beat Vader and doesn’t strive to bring the Jedi order back to its former glory.

7.The clones didn’t get enough love in the final episode.  Rex got a lot but I feel like they tried to get away from them because of Order 66, but I think it would have been better to go all in.

8.Seeing Jesse (that was Jesse right?) leading the 501st against Rex and Ahsoka was one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve seen.

9.if you couldn’t tell I think most of Rebels is lazy. 

10.I feel like we should have gotten more Obi-wan and Anakin in the final season. (They just needed to do an actual entire season)

11.I feel the end of Domino Squad’s story wasn’t given enough importance in the Bad Batch Arch. 

12.I don’t know if I hate it for emotional or actual good reason but I can’t stand that Rex and Ahsoka never got to say any goodbyes.

13.Im still bothered that we never see Boil again. I feel Waxer and Boil were so cool just never given enough attention.

14. I kinda wish we saw the clone from the beginning of the show again.  The fact that I only have seen 20 some minutes of them but remember Thire, Jek, and Rys is ridiculous and I’m kinda sad about it.  

15.While the fight between Maul and Ahsoka was good and it felt earned in the sense of them being CW characters (You can’t really say Maul isn’t) and surrounded by everything the clone wars cast built, but it felt like a weird moment just because they really aren’t connected. 

16.This is just kinda a personal thing but I legitimately don’t know what to do now because this show has been in my life forever.",The Clone Wars ended and I’m gonna say some maybe controversial opinions

What are the best 3-4 episode of Clone Wars for her to watch to really build up the Anakin/Obi Wan dynamics that lead into Revenge of the Sith?

StarWars,"TL;DR: Instead of focusing on the negative, appreciate the positive. The newest generation of Star Wars is just as amazing as the previous generations, look past the negativity and marvel at the incredible stories we have.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I read the latest of many articles that have been published in the past year or so about the death of Star Wars as we know it. This particular article was published on CNET and detailed some of the universe breaking scenes from the Rise of Skywalker, among other things, that are causing the author to walk away from the fandom. We live in a time where everyone wants to defeat everyone else. Where the immediate reaction to an opposing idea is to tear it down and try to rally others to the opposition. I propose that this mindset is tearing us apart. Instead, we shall unite under the positivity of what we love. The characteristics of Star Wars that each generation of fandom fell in love with, whether your true Star Wars love is the OT, PT, ST, cartoons, EU, comics, Holiday Special or, whatever else, are still alive and well in a galaxy far, far, away.

&amp;#x200B;

First, let's look inward. Yup, at ourselves. Whether you spend your days on the playground, in the neighborhood on your bike with your friends, in the boardroom, in a cubicle, at your desk, or wherever else your life's journey has brought you, I want you to think about your journey. Think about what you are really proud of with your current circumstances. Have you had success? Are you good to other people? Do you take care of other people? Make people laugh? Accomplish goals? Make sacrifices? Each and every person on the planet, from the bouncing baby who just figured out how to crawl all the way to the grandmother passing her wisdom and accomplishments on to her family, has incredible successes earned through the trials of the human experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I want you to pick some of the things you are proud of and focus on the flip side. What have you failed at on your road to that positive outcome? Have you let people down? Failed to accomplish a goal? Didn't live up to your standards at some point? Found some messy bits? Fallen down and gotten back up? At some point in the storyline of your success is some aspect of doubt, failure or, imperfection. It is not all perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Us humans are imperfect to our core. Perfection is not the goal, nor is it even a possibility. How do we even go on then? If we fail on an unrelenting constant basis as people, groups, teams, fandoms, and nations, how do we continue on every day? Because we grant ourselves grace and unite under positivity and the passions we share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Grace. Let's focus on that and then drive this one home. Grace can be described as giving someone or something some ""slack."" It is the opposite of attacking someone when things go sideways. We would not be where we are today without grace. We rely on the concept of grace to coexist! Without grace, we would have bashed each other off of the planet with rocks a long time ago. Despite our best efforts to obliterate ourselves in the name of disagreement, grace always prevails. To grant that grace to ourselves and each other, we must ignore the reflex to tear down what we don't like or disagree with. This can only be accomplished if we get comfortable with the lost concept of civil discourse, the art of respecting your opposition, and finding common ground.

&amp;#x200B;

As members of the fandom, we all fell in love with Star Wars. Usually to the point of being able to look past whatever flaws exist in our favorite piece of Star Wars media. As our society has become more and more critical of everything, we as a fandom have become more and more critical of the flaws in Star Wars. There are problems in the OT, the PT, the ST, the cartoons and, every other bit of Star Wars media. There are problems in all Marvel media. There are imperfections in your car's paint job. There are problems at your favorite restaurant. There are problems at your job, in your closet, with your dinner last night, with your text messages and in every other conceivable facet of existence. But we possess the grace to look past all of that and appreciate the good in each of those things. It's time to start paying out some of that grace.

&amp;#x200B;

On this May the 4th, instead of allowing the dark side of the Force materialize as negativity in your heart about something that you loved so much at one point in your life, allow the light to guide you to all of the positives. Grant Star Wars the grace you grant yourself. So many amazing Star Wars gifts have been given to us in the past couple of years. Find the aspects you love and focus on those today. Then, take that positivity and spread it around, it's contagious.

StarWars,"My first memory of Star Wars is a picture of Jabba in a TV guide. Must have been early to mid 90s. My dad told me it's that movie with the little bears (Ewoks). We recorded Episode 6 on VHS and it became my favourite movie (I know there's tons of ppl that don't like RotJ) and I still like it the most because of the fond childhood memories. I watched it like once a week and almost cried every time Luke burned Vader. From this point on I absorbed everything Star Wars: Magazines, Games (I could't get past level 1 on Super Empire Strikes back on SNES), TOYS TOYS and TOYS again. My room was filled with posters and TIEs and X-Wings. Action Fleet (anyone remember) and self made Lego starfighters.",What is your earliest memory of Star Wars?
StarWars,"Happy May the 4th to all of you!!!  


I feel like getting into Star Wars ""again."" I have always been a super Star Wars fan, but I never really got into lore books etc. I read a couple of Star Wars novels in my life but that's pretty much it. I would like to get more into the lore so I can better know what happens between the movies, know more about the characters, why they decided to do what they did, etc.  


Is there a Star Wars ""History"" book out there so I could learn about all that without having to read every single novel? Kind of like a compendium or all the major events happening in Star Wars? I kind of doubt such a book exists but I think it'd be a good idea to publish one if it has not been done already.

StarWars,"I just think that it wasn’t the fulfilling ending I hoped for. Nothing really happened that episode don’t get me wrong I still liked the episode I just think it deserved a better ending. 

My main point for this:
The dialogue was very lacklustre as all together no one really said anything which worked for me in the previous episode but not this one.

If Ahsoka has to remove the inhibitor chip from Rex then how did Wolffe and Gregor do it.

The episode didn’t give that much to the relationship between Ahsoka and Rex the previous episode did a better job. 

I expected Jesse to die don’t get me wrong I know at this point clones were the bad guys but idk I expected something more from Jesse then for him to just fall to his death at the end.

At the end of the day this is just my opinion I still liked the episode I just don’t think it was as great as people think but people are entitled to their opinions too so I respect people like it. I just expected a grander ending for such a great TV show.","The Clone wars ending wasn’t that great (Just my opinion, everyone is entitled to that)"
StarWars,"I'm not sure how this post will be reacted to but it's my opinion. The way Maul and Ahsoka duel is nothing compared to any fight in star wars history. I know it's not the same animations but their movements are humanlike, Jedi and Sith are fast, strong, capable of moving with fluency, whereas they moved as if they were training. We've seen the ferocity of mauls fights such as the way he fought Sidious, and the speed Ahsoka can duel at, I expected the intensity of the anakin vs Kenobi duel but was presented with a slow fight that is illogical with their abilities. I haven't looked at much but I figure they used human sensors for the duel animation.",The Ahsoka Vs Maul Fight

StarWars,"So in Revenge of the Sith; Order 66 is given and the clones generally react as if they’ve known about the order the whole time and were just waiting for it to be given.

In Clone Wars, we’re led to believe that Order 66 is a secret, even to the clones, and that upon being given the code words; their subliminal programming kicks in and they’re compelled to execute the Jedi. We even see Rex struggle with the decision for a moment before trying to execute Asoka.

That’s fine, I get it that the story changes a bit over time and with different writers.

But my question is; if the order is to execute Jedi; why would Rex attempt to kill Asoka? He (and the rest of the clones) know that she is no longer a Jedi.

They even have to be given a separate order to execute Maul as well (presumably since he’s not a Jedi and would be safe from Order 66).

Furthermore; in Revenge of the Sith; we see Order 66 enacted without any harm coming to Anakin. In fact; he leads an entire clone battalion on the assault of the Jedi temple.

So are we to assume that Order 66 automatically means kill any known force user (except Palpatine) and that Palpatine had to given an additional command (unseen on screen) to all clones that Anakin was safe from Order 66?",Order 66 Question
StarWars,"Personally I have always been enamoured by the direction and story boarding of the Gendy Tartakovski series. There was an ingrained value towards patience and timing in the action scenes, it wasn’t afraid to indulge in its atmosphere or take itself seriously and for that I unabashedly admire it despite the scene where Jas’en wipped out his junk. In addition to this, it withholds the best interpretation of Grievous hands down. Sad that Filoni came down and suppressed him into a cowardly moustache twirler, whom covers up the dubious deeds of his master.

StarWars,"I'm about an hour in, and I've resorted to making this post to alleviate some fo the boredom. There are a few moments so dumb they're funny, but the rest is awful. It's really weird how the animated part comes in for no reason. It was really jarring, but I kinda liked it more than the live-action parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot of strange scenes and really weird universe stuff. I know it's not canon, but seeing English instead of Aurebesh was really strange. The music also was pretty wacky. lots of strange sounds, and it didn't feel like star wars.

I would really like a line of Power of the Force style figures based on the prequels and sequels. 

I wish that for about a week or so everything I know in my head about Star Wars gets erased so I can read novelizations of the movies and see how the characters and ships and worlds look in my mind based on my own imagination.

StarWars,"For me, the Clones were the best part of the show, and I loved every episode where I got to see them interact together. I loved watching the stories of different clones as they go from battle to battle, watching some grow to become veteran soldiers while also seeing many die along the way. At the end of the final episode, the shot of Jesses helmet amongst the grave sites really hurt as I did not just see the sad end to a veteran clone character (who was one of my favorites), but also an end to the stories of the Clones as we saw them in TCW.",Anyone else gutted at the fate of the Clones and the realization that we will not see them on screen anymore?

With clone wars finished, i watched the Mandalorian behind the scenes episode 1. The one thing that stood out was the love and respect from everyone towards Dave Filoni. Can’t disagree with them.

Also Reddit and Instagram have nothing other than love for this man’s work. And what he delivered was beautiful and pure.

I am not a sequel hater, but the work delivered on the clone wars and The Mandalorian is so much better imo.

StarWars,"I’m new to this group but I just wanted to show my appreciation to both Dave Filoni and George Lucas. 

My first language was Spanish and I actually learned English by watching the Star Wars movies growing up. I actually wrote a paper about Star Wars when I was in undergrad regarding how much it shaped me as a person. The series was my life, just like many on this page, and just finishing TCW finale and I am at a loss of words. I cried for Rex, I cried for Asoka, I cried for Anakin. It was satisfying it was to see a finale that had so much raw emotion and I was content with what was written.

Thank you so much Dave Filoni and George Lucas for creating art for the fans that have grown up with the franchise. This is a collaboration that will be missed.

#thankyoudaveandgeorge","Thank you, Dave Filoni and George Lucas"
StarWars,"People conveniently forget that it was Star Wars fans who bit the George Lucas hand that fed them to the point of Lucasfilm/Disney pandering to the hate as to not step on any toes by creating a story of nostalgia seemingly made in a board room. Star Wars fans loved it until they thought about its unoriginality and proceeded to hate it.

So then Star Wars needed to go back to its roots of being a true independent film like the original Star Wars in the sense of one writer/director, George Lucas and Rian Johnson. Rian's independence of the film took Star Wars in new directions and half the fandom complained that their childhood was ""ruined"".

So then Disney played it safe in the middle with rehashed subplots, and now people hate the trilogy.

Disney didn't plan out the trilogy because Star Wars fans are a fucking pest to please. We hate George Lucas, Disney tries to appease us, then we hate JJ Abrams for appeasing us, then we hate independent Rian Johnson for being bold and new, and then we hate JJ Abrams again for going back to the old.

Star Wars fans need to appreciate that they just got a brand new trilogy and accept the films for what they are, not what we want them to be. Let's not forget that the 10 year old girls and boys of today are the priority demographic of Star Wars who, in 10 years, will celebrate the sequel trilogy on reddit just like the prequel trilogy for last decade's 10 year olds.",Star Wars fans can't be pleased
StarWars,"The more I think about it, Maul and Savage is almost everything that I wanted from General Grievous. The similarities are striking.

* Savage is the menacing Jedi killer and managed to rack up a higher body count than Grievous ever did in the show
* He is also trained by Count Dooku
* Maul is the calculating cyborg nemesis of Kenobi that always runs away when he loses
* Maul even got Grievous' legs for a short time
* All three of them also have villain names that are super on-the-nose... 

It seems as if, by including the Zabrak brothers, the writers subconsciously compensated for all those missed opportunities with Grievous.",Maul and Savage filled a hole that Grievous was supposed to occupy
StarWars,"I have never watched the Clone Wars. I'm going to rectify that soon. I was aware that Maul survived Episode 1, but seeing him in Solo left a bad taste in my mouth. This guy said maybe five words in Episode 1 and here he is spouting so much exposition it's like he's an office manager or something. I feel it detracted from the *amazing* duel in Episode 1 and his strong silent presence.

Sheev's return was rushed but made logical sense. The alternative.. introducing a new Sith creature in the final episode.. would be jarring. Where was this dude for eight episodes? And it would dininish Palps as the ultimate bad guy. Having the Emperor reveal himself in the final episode also is consistent with Lucas's and Kurtz's vision of the original nine episode arc.

I will watch the Clone Wars and  I'm sure I'll enjoy Maul there. I have a good feeling about this. Happy Star Wars day.. I love all of you !! Even if our favorite Star Wars may be different. May the force be with you, always.",Maul's resurrection bothers me more than Sheev's
StarWars,"I mean I might be exaggerating but I think Darth Vader is the best villain (at least top 10) that I have seen. Because honestly he is pretty complex, there are times when you think Vader is just a mask that Anakin puts up so that he can excuse his many terrible actions, because if he isn’t Vader then he is a terrible person beyond redemption which is what I guess he views himself as before he meets Luke. 
He believes there is no good in him anymore or at least convinces himself that there is not good in him so that he can’t stop all the terrible things that are happening and have happened because of his actions. But deep down inside he wants himself to be punished for actions that he cannot forgive himself for. Basically he does terrible things to cause himself pain, things that Anakin Skywalker would hate himself after doing.
So essentially Vader is the mask that Anakin puts on (Figuratively and literally) to kind of punish himself for his actions, something that Luke eventually shows him isn’t necessary and that he can stop torturing himself and remove the mask to become Anakin Skywalker again and in that forgive himself for everything he has done. Vader just needed someone to see something that he himself saw within but was in doubt of, that deep down inside he never became a truly evil person, that was he still was a good man and when Luke, his own son (Who would remind him of Padmé) believed that he remembered who he really was beyond the lies of the emperor.

So at least I think that Anakin was always a good man even as Vader but as Vader he was just trying to convince himself very hard that he wasn’t . 

Just a thought what do you guys think? 👀",I love how complex Darth Vader is
StarWars,"I love Star Wars, grew up with it and it played a huge part of childhood. Star Wars the Clone Wars was different though, as I got to live through it in a sense. It kinda grew with me. As I got older, it got better. It was so cool to me seeing what the clones did especially after playing battlefront 2 pretty much daily at one point. I say all this because I didn’t think the clone wars ending would hit me like this. I’m not like super sad it’s ending, especially with an ending this great. But it kinda feels weird. For a long time we all got to speculate what happened (like with the unfinished arcs) but now we know. There’s no more of the clone wars story to tell after this (besides maybe revisiting past parts, but I mean more literally) The story’s there, from beginning to end. It’s actually over. And it was a great ride to apart of. May the 4th be with y’all",I just wanna say this about the clone wars
StarWars,"Star Wars has been a big part in my life as it has been in yours. From the day I saw the first movie I loved it in an instant. We bought the movies, lego sets and collectibles because our love for Star Wars seems impossible. For some of us it was probably the same thing we were bullied for because it was “nerdy” but it didn’t matter because at the end of the day Star Wars gave us the greatest feeling. It is sad to seeing the very thing I grew up on end today but it’s ok because at some point things have to end and without a doubt Star Wars ended with a bang.

Rest in peace to all the heroes of the Clone Wars. The Jedi, who lead valiantly in a war that upended their ideals. The clones, both the legendary and the unsung, who fought to the death in a war they had no part in. The Mandalorians, subjugated time and time again to civil war and cultural upheaval.The citizens of the Republic, forced into a galaxy of chaos by a leader they were forced to believe in. I grew up with this show, and along with the OT, PT, and KOTOR, it basically got me into Star Wars. Hell, it was the only Star Wars that was still coming out when I was a kid. I grew up alongside these clones, their commanders. Back when each battle seemed like a new adventure, each soldier a new hardened hero. I remember back when Hevy was the most developed clone. It seems so long ago now. Seeing this last season, especially these last four episodes has made me insanely grateful for this excellent show, which changed my childhood. To George Lucas and Dave Filoni; to Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, and James Arnold Taylor; to the countless writers, composers, voice actors, animators, and crew members: thank you for making my childhood what it was.

StarWars,"Okay so here’s my thoughts on EP12. I loved this episode it was really good and from a Star Wars fan who’s been watching the movies since the age of 3, to seeing the first clone wars movie when I was 6, I felt this was such a good payoff. I maybe would of included things which may of felt dragged it one and wouldn’t of been as emotional but one thing I would of liked I think would of been even more emotional than it already was. The things I would of loved to happen was Ahoska and Anakin to have one last conversation maybe just before he’s turned to the dark side or maybe just after, but that may of contradicted Rebels because I’m pretty sure Ahoska didn’t know that Anakin was Darth Vader till rebels. Another thing I would of loved which I think they missed out was how rex found Wolffe and Gregor, I think that would of been cool which they could of made a whole episode over however if they just had a cut where it was nothing to do with Ahoska then it could of broken up emotional tension. One thing I would of loved was when Darth Vader walked up to Ahoskas light saber on which I think was Hoth, Vader picked up her lightsabers and maybe with a sad voice said “Ahoska” and then it cut to Ahoska and she opened her eyes and said “master?” Or maybe not switching to Ahoska but they definitely should of made Vader say something. However even though I listed a lot of thing I think it was a great episode and a great ending. One of the best TV series ever and 100% the best animated Tv show. Might have to binge watch the rest of the seasons and then S7. Also happy May 4th",My thoughts on EP12 of the clone wars SPOILERS

On that note... Please enjoy part 1 of my Star Wars series. 

=============================================

A young Togruta woman sat at a table with an older Weequay man. The Togruta was wearing a set of dark brown overalls but the straps were tied around her waist instead of over her shoulders. The blue long sleeve shirt she was wearing had the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. Her fingerless gloves were dirty with oil and soot. Her goggles were up on her forehead covering part of her facial markings. She had a stern look on her face as she stared down the Weequay before her, her bare feet tapped in sync with her own heartbeat. 

The Weequay was dressed in high end garments and each finger was covered in expensive jewelry. He sat across from the Togruta and examined her up and down. 

""Are you sure this is the one I called for?"" The Weequay asked one of his many guards and they nodded in response. ""She does not look like she has the reputation you say she does.""

""Looks can be deceiving."" The woman said in a monotone voice not breaking eye contact. 

""I suppose they can. Can I assume you already know what you're hauling for me?"" he said. 

""I do.""

""Your pay?""

""I wouldn't have taken the job if I didn't know the pay.""

""Good. Do you know the route I wish for you to take?"" he asked as he motioned for a guard to come closer. 

She kept an eye on the guard as he approached. ""No."" 

The guard handed the Weequay a holovid and he laid it on the table. A map of the galaxy was projected as he began to talk. The planet Bakura, which they currently resided on, was highlighted, as well as Kalee... Her destination. 

""Why wouldn't you want one of your own men for a trip like this?"" she asked. 

The route is highlighted and it cut through the left, more empty side of the galaxy... The Unknown Regions. Suddenly, she understood why he wanted her. 

""I don't value you as much as my own men. No other pilot I could find was willing to do a run like this even for a high price."" The Weequay said. 

She contemplated her job for a moment as she studied the route laid before her. He wanted her to swing past both Jeddha and Ilum into incredibly dangerous and unmapped territory away from any and all established hyperspace lanes. This path alone would take her a month to traverse so she'd have to stock up on rations and whatnot before the trip. 

""I need upfront payment. Thirty-five percent at the minimum."" she said. 

The Weequay looked almost stunned at the request. ""And what for?""

""You want me to make the trip without starving to death, don't you?"" The woman said. 

He nodded without a word and motioned the same guard towards a vault. The money is exchanged, they go over the last few details, and they said their goodbyes. 

""It's a pleasure working with you, Joren Kay. Don't make me regret this."" The Weequay said as the Togruta takes her credits and leaves. She restocked her supplies and departed the station on Bakura and flew into orbit in her Ghtroc 720 light freighter. She programmed the coordinates for Zonama Sekot, as that was where she'd have to slingshot her trip from to resupply. 

Joren's BD unit, BD-9, appeared from a compartment on the other side of the cockpit and jumped into her lap. 

""Hey, Bud. Good to see ya. This one is gunna be a different one from what we're used to."" Joren said as she sent the ship into hyperdrive. 

BD-9 looked at her and tilted his head in a curious way. She filled him in on the details as she got up and headed back to the living quarters with BD riding on her back, avoiding her lekku the best he could. She said down on the couch and laid back. 

""Wake me up in an hour."" she said. BD nodded and nuzzled up on her belly as he waited patiently for her nap to finish. 

An hour passed and BD woke her up as the ship was only minutes from it's rendezvous at Zonama Sekot. After staying in stable orbit for a few rotations, she punched the ship into sub-light speed as she began her journey into the Unknown Region. A few days go by of nothing but rocks flying by. The advanced autopilot kept the freighter from hitting anything it couldn't sustain at this speed so that Joren and BD could play their games in the living quarters to pass the time. 

Little do they know that their ship has gathered the attention of a much bigger ship just outside of their sensors.",[Fan-Made Story] Lucrehulk: Genesis

StarWars,"Ok so before you come at me with blasters hear me out. This is just what I see looking at the movie and the clone wars tv show. So we know all the movies 1-9 at least not counting the other prequels. Are about Anakin skywalker and the skywalker line but think about it though is it really? We knew that it was the emperors plan to  eventually take over the republic for himself and transform it into the empire. Anakin was just a piece of his plot so he could set it in motion. Think about it how would the separatist know about certain attacks or information only the Jedi and republic had? Well that’s because the emperor was pulling strings, telling the separatist What was going on. Meanwhile he was also the big cheese of the separatist and eventually when everything came in circle with what the emperor wanted he got rid of the last separatist. So to conclude it’s really about the rise and fall of the republic and a story about a crazy man who wanted to rule the galaxy for him self Anakin was just a piece of his step, along with Darth Maul, Count Dukuo and General Grievous. Also 7-9 were just away to try to rebuild his empire but it obviously failed.",What if Star Wars is not really about Anakin skywalker or the skywalker line
StarWars,"So with the final episode of the clone wars series out and may 4th being upon us, I decided to put together a complete watch order for the movies, tv series, and major video games included in the Disney canon, going so far as to split up revenge of the sith between the movie and the siege of mandalore to the best of my ability. I did not include novels, comics, or any minor video games such as Star Wars commander (the game is about to be shut down anyway). Enjoy, and may the 4th be with you all!

StarWars,"Ok so I’m rewatching the prequels for the umpteenth time but first in a few years and this is about the closest I’m ever going to come to seeing these movies as though for the first time. I had a revelation.

Episode I always felt a little disjointed from the rest of the trilogy to me. It takes place much earlier, doesn’t involve the Clone War, and Anakin’s story feels shoehorned in as he has little to do with the overall narrative. So why start the trilogy there instead of giving us three movies set during the Clone War?

In Episode III Anakin is devastated when the Jedi Council won’t grant him the rank of master, way more upset than is justifiable. It had never really struck me as that weird because he’s obviously lustful of power but what about this- Anakin was born a slave, had to endure insults because of it but more importantly had to think of Watto as his master; he gets freed and joins with the Jedi where he doesn’t escape the masters of his enslavement- everywhere he looks is someone else he has to call “master.” When the moment finally came for him to be the master, after all his training and the heroics he performed on behalf of the republic and the Jedi, the rug is pulled out from under him. “We do not grant you the rank of master,” Mace Windu tells him disdainfully.

No wonder he turned to the dark side. With the Sith certainly there is a master and an apprentice but both of them are lords and that sounds way more impressive than just being a master.",Slave Master Lord
StarWars,"I suppose probably not as it was kept a secret that Anakin and Vader were the same person for more than a decade after Endor, and there's no indication Rex was ever privy to that secret.  

But perhaps that during their years with the Rebellion he told Luke about his adventures and bond with Anakin and Luke would let him know about his General's end.  (Heck come to think of it, they could reasonably retcon it so that Rex was source of most of Luke's understanding about the man his father used to be.)",Rex was on Endor -- do you think he paid his respects at Anakin's funeral pyre?
StarWars,"The clone wars series finale very much left me wanting more. First of all the actual runtime of the episode was only around 19 minutes, making it the shortest episode by far. Second the whole thing less the last 2 minutes was just ashoka and rex escaping a falling cruiser, didnt have anything to do with the jedi or order 66 other than the inherent fact that they were trying to kill ashoka and rex. That episode didnt leave me with emotions like episode 11 did.

I feel like they could've done a 40 minute episode and put more than just ashoka and rex in it. Like anakin slaughtering jedi and obi finding dead younglings or at least something more like an emotional scene/remake of all the clone wars jedi weve come to love being shot down by their clone troopers. Was very underwhelming in my opinion.",I'm underwhelmed.
StarWars,"TL;DR Master George Lucas needed a TV show and a good director as his apprentice to fully execute his vision on Anakin Skywalker.

There is no doubt that George Lucas is a creative genius. However that doesn't neccessarily translate to storytelling genius, which is evident in his questionable directing in the prequels.

However with a good director like David Filoni who can take George Lucas's ideas and creativity and channel them into a much more coherent storytelling format that the masses would find compelling, Lucas' vision for Anakin's rise and fall is fully described in the story arcs of The Clone Wars - we know how closely the two worked together in creating these episodes.

We truly got to see Anakin gradually and organically grow and mature into a truly heroic Jedi warrior with his infamous fatal flaws of attachment and emotional outbursts, which slowly and graudually grew more apparent. We saw the final straws that broke the camel's back in Revenge of the Sith when he finally falls to the dark side, but we got to see the rest of the load being added on one by one in The Clone Wars.

That part you may probably have heard before many times, but it's probably no coincidence that it fit in so seamlessly between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, because that was what George Lucas wanted to show us from the very beginning - he just couldn't coherently form it into a compelling story that we would enjoy. He tried showing us key parts of Anakin's life and events that would cement his downfall into the dark side, but it only partly came through for the audience in the movies. However with a medium like a TV show to work with alongside his apprentice David Filoni who was a far better storyteller, his vision of a truly heroic Anakin Skywalker with fatal flaws that were unfortunately amplified over time was truly realised.

There's a reason why those of us who grew up watching The Clone Wars were hit a lot harder by the fall of Anakin Skywalker. We were simply fortunate enough to have grown up watching George Lucas fully execute his vision on the character.",The Clone Wars completes George Lucas' vision for the prequels

StarWars,"I'm not here to discuss how good the movie is. I dont really like in the context of the whole franchise at all. However, I just absolutely fucking love watching that first little sequence. Like it's just so fucking absurd and hammy like Palpatines back! Kylo Ren is running around killing people Adam Driver is looking kick ass as ever. The shots are really satisfying to watch. And then the way palpatine delivers ""the dark side is a pathway to many abilities"" like it's his catchphrase. I dont know it's just so bombastic. Even though it still would have had a lot of problems I'm sure, I wish the film kept that same chaotic confident energy throughout, would have made for a much more entertaining movie for me.

StarWars,"I always watched the prequels, and could never find much redeeming about anakin. He came off as a petulant teenager and frankly a creep who u was half convinced used a mind trick to get padme to fall for him. 

Then I watched TCW starting in January, and caught up about halfway through the seventh season...this anakin was tragic. He was amazingly likable, good, kind, and funny. The thought of him falling to the dark side is almost unfathomable, which is why I wish the prequels would have showed him like that...it would have been far more effective. This anakin falling has very empty, and his fall is very Shakespearean.

In any case, I am just having a hard time coming to terms with him falling to Vader, and once again I apologize because I’m sure this is a tired topic but just wanted to post this as a first time clone wars person.","I’m sure this has been discussed a billion times, but I’m new to clone wars, and after finishing them I simply can’t get over anakin turning."

So i went about reading up on some of the canon, after return of the Jedi there were two other Emperors, there's the battle on jakku, theres an entire story where leia attempts to run for the Senate of the new republic but it gets revealed that her father was vader and ultimately fails. Seasons can have time skips as you would eventually have to reach a time close to TFA.

StarWars,"I read an article just now titled ""Star Wars Has Lost Its Mystique And Rise Of Skywalker Is To Blame"". It's goes on to discuss how alot of the decisions made in the 9th film ruined Star Wars and more specifically some of the ideas put fourth in The Last Jedi. I've seen this sentiment echoed a few different times and I believe it's misguided and inaccurate. I'll try to explain why.


Make no mistake about it, neither the 8th or the 9th film are perfect. They're both far from it but to blame the shortcomings of one on the other is overlooking the real issue. The fact of the matter is that Disney, for some odd reason, chose to hire two different directors for such a huge project. It's clear to me that despite what they may say, they were not on the same page and it really hurt the flow of the trilogy.


I'm not here to bash Rian Johnson, it was rumored that he may get his own trilogy in the Star Wars universe. If that were to happen I'd watch it and most likely enjoy it. As a stand alone film, The Last Jedi is an enjoyable watch. However as part of the sequel trilogy it's a mess that does more harm than good. 


Alot of his choices are baffling and show the lack of cohesion between him and Abrams. Listing a few, the casino scene is unnecessary, killing Snoke with no explanation of his back story is unsatisfying, Leia floating back into the ship was laughable, the Holdo manuever is questionable at best, Luke's character choices I don't particularly like and Roses character similar to the casino scene is just bad and unnecessary. 


People take issue when you bring up some of these things. Two in particular I'll address my reasoning for. First Luke's character, people like to talk about subverting expectations when it comes to this film. That's all well and good but there's a way to do it and then there's just doing it for no reason. I feel alot of the choices in this film don't fit the overarching narrative of the trilogy or Star Wars in general. This to me is definitely one of them, I just don't believe this is what Luke would become. It feels like a betrayal of his character and a forced way to subvert our expectations. 


The second issue I'll address is Rose's character. Completely irrelevant, poorly written and just no need to be in the movie whatsoever. You say things like this and people try to say you're sexiest or racist. Look I don't care if it was a man, woman, black, white, Asian, Latin, Wookie, Rodian or any other alien race from the Star Wars universe. Kelly Marie Tran is a fine actor and it's not her fault the character she was given sucks. I have no animosity towards her but I do think the writers did her a disservice. It was clear from the first film that Finn and Rey have a connection of sorts. But for some reason they throw Finn into this relationship with Rose that ultimately leads nowhere and just feels off when looking at the trilogy as a whole. Another clear example of the directors simply not being on the same page.



I want to be clear that I don't blame Rian Johnson. I don't blame J.J. This to me comes down to the baffling decision to hire different directors for a trilogy as massive as this one. I'd love to know what the full vision of J.J.s trilogy would look like. Don't get me wrong Rise of Skywalker has its fair share of issues too. All the ""course correcting"" it did, along with some of the conclusions it arrived at are not great in their own right. But I feel alot if this has to do with what Rian left him to work with. 


Both of these films can be enjoyable to watch. But the lack of cohesion is what frustrates me the most. It's clear to me that Rian's movie went against alot of what J.J. had planned and that is unfortunate. More than anything I blame the studio for this and instead of us arguing why we dislike one or the other or both. I think it's important we take a step back and understand why things turned out the way they did. 


I'm of the opinion that J.J. should have written all 3 of these films. Then as I said I'm sure I'd enjoy a separate Rian Johnson trilogy set in the universe. It's a shame this is what we ended up with. As far as an overarching narritive goes what we got is kind of a mess and leads to alot of dissention in the community. To blame the final film and say it ruins Star Wars is unfair to me. As does saying that same thing about the 8th film. They both have flaws but the problem to me is the lack of cohesion between the two directors and not the films themselves.",The real issue with the sequel trilogy
StarWars,"In the movies &amp; Clone Wars TV series, the light side force users who become force ghost only talk to the people they personally knew. Qui gon only talks to Yoda, Anakin and Obi-wan, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin only talk to Luke, Luke &amp; Leia only appear to Rey, etc. The only situation where this wasn't the case was that moment in ROS where Rey fights Palpatine, but given that was presented as a pivotal moment in the force, it seems like an exception to the rule. This would explain why Anakin never appeared &amp; spoke with Rey or Ben.",THEORY: Light side force users can only communicate to those they have a connection with.
StarWars,"I’m getting more into the expanded universe and was just wondering. I’m not trying to preach an agenda or looking to demonize Star Wars or talk about anything post-RotS. Please do not come here to rant about your opinions on the writing and/or casting of the movies or sexism/gender theory in the real world. 

Are there examples of Jedi being sexist or thinking female Jedi are inferior? Is it something that’s been phased out entirely within the order with how young everyone is when they join? I assume it still exists on other planets and in other cultures but I’m looking for information specifically on how Jedi viewed sex (and how they viewed gender if that comes up at all).",Did sexism exist within the Jedi Order?
StarWars,"I just finished watching the last episode ever of Clone Wars and I swear to god I almost cried. Not because the ending was particularly emotional or anything, though it was, but because this show was my childhood. I remember going to the theatre to see the movie, stopping at Walmart and McDonalds on the way home so my parents could buy me a happy meal and some Star Wars action figures. I was just an outlet for fantasies and creative thoughts back then. No personality beyond trying to be the funny guy. I guess some things never change. This isn’t just about the Clone Wars. It’s about what’s changed. Everything has gotten better. But, in a way, they’ve gotten worse too. That outlet I had when I was a kid has died. What was thoughts and love for the present has now become hope and thoughts for the future. I’m a different guy than I was back then. But, one thing I’ve always had in my life has been Star Wars. Since the day I pointed at a funny shape on a Disney World map, it’s always been here with me. I’ve always watched the movies, read the books, and played the games. Back then it was my shitty plug and play R2-D2 console. But it was also Clone Wars. I got older, and Minecraft came along. I lost that Plug and Play somewhere along the way. And when I tired of Minecraft, what did I have? Star Wars the Clone Wars. There always seemed to be another episode in my DVR. And as always, I was happy to watch it. I love Star Wars, and with it’s future uncertain today, I felt the need to take the time to reflect. Here’s to you, Clone Wars. To the 8 year old kid inside me, you’ll always be awesome. You’ll always be inspiring. You’ll always be a part of me. Cheers.",A Toast to The Clone Wars

On my 4K disc of Rogue One, at precisely time index 2:07:11 the audio (which is just the end credits music at this point) ""pops"" (you can actually hear a little ""pop"" noise) and it becomes instantly louder than it was before that. This is using the Dolby Atmos track btw. I don't understand why this is happening. I looked at the 4K digital version (using the code that came with my disc) and it didn't have this problem, so I know for a fact that this should not be happening and that there is some sort of glitch here. The regular Blu-ray version doesn't have this problem either.

Thank you.",Can anyone here please help me? It's about the Rogue One 4K DISC.
StarWars,"I just watched this right as it hit at midnight. The hype for this did not go unrewarded. The epic buildup through the whole season did not disappoint. 

A notable and sad moment was when Jesse had all of the clones together on the hangar blocking Rex and Ahsoka. Rex was trying to convince them that she wasn’t a Jedi. Jesse accused Rex of violating Order 66 and ordered all of the clones to fire on them. This tore me apart because of Jesse and Rex’s friendship. 

The crash of the Venator was awesome to watch. Ahsoka falling through the air with Rex trying to catch her in the Y-Wing was beautifully animated and action-packed. When they landed, she seemed to feel guilty by what she had done to escape. She buried every clone she could find and dropped her lightsaber on the ground. She walks away.


And... Oh. My. God. The last scene. An Imperial shuttle landing at the Venator Crash Site with snow troopers patrolling the area. We hear mechanical breathing and black boots walking in the snow. Vader walks to the Venator. He observes the graves of the 501st Battalion with Ahsoka’s markings on the helmets piked up. He sees something in the snow and reaches for it. Ahsoka’s lightsaber, covered in ice. He ignites it and walks away. 

The last shot of Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a clone helmet in the snow reflecting Vader walking away.


This episode was amazing, to put it simply. It showed how Ahsoka was forgiving of the clones and how she hated to fight them. I had goosebumps all through the second half. The way that the show ends in the clone helmet shot was just so incredibly well done. Dave Filoni has proved time and time again to be an amazing writer and director. He needs to be making Star Wars movies.

Also the saddest shot in the episode was the clones being ordered to fire on the droids helping Ahsoka and Rex escape.",Episode 12: Victory and Death -My Take
StarWars,"The clone wars is almost over and I would just like to say thank you to Dave Filoni, Matt Lanter, James Arnold Taylor, Ashley Eckstein, Dee Bradley Baker, Ian Abercrombie, Sam Witwer, Corey Burton, Catherine Tabwr, Tom Kane, Matthew Wood, Jim Cummings, Jon Favreau and everyone who made the clone wars what it is and for making our childhoods great by introducing and perfecting these amazing characters and quite honestly, saving the entire prequel trilogy

Thank you and the best of luck for all your future projects",Victory and Death
StarWars,"Yes, it seems like I’m jumping on the “sequel suck bandwagon” cause I am.

The first 6 movies + clone wars and rebels make a perfect story arch for Star Wars as a whole. And it has a happy ending. We watch the as Anakin turns into Vader, and back to Anakin again.  The rise and fall of the empire. Everything is perfect (from an overarching story perspective) 

The first 6 movies were Anakin’s story. They were about a republic that became the evil empire they were about a civil war for freedom. The fall of the Jedi knights. At the end of the saga we had some amazing characters and a great story. The Jedi, republic, and Anakin all had happy endings.

THEN THE SEQUEL TRILOGY comes along and says, “nah Luke failed to make new Jedi.” Destroys the republic which makes the OG trilogy useless, and then kills off characters we loved for a useless conflict. The ending was perfect and the sequel trilogy feels like a addition to just make money. 

Thoughts?",After watching clone wars’ finale I dislike the sequel trilogy even more.

StarWars,"In a recent episode of The Clone Wars, Maul explains that he played his part and was then cast away. What exactly was his part? Duel two random Jedi on Naboo and get cut in half? No. Here I will explain his part and why his master Palpatine is a genius. 

Palpatine was friends with the Jedi council long before he became supreme chancellor, that and the Trade Federation blockading his homeworld allowed him special knowledge of which Jedi knights would be partaking in the negotiations to remove said blockade. Dooku, who had trained Qui Gon Jinn had already left the Order at this point and was falling to the dark side. Dooku was a brilliant strategist and swordsman, an ally Palpatine would need in the coming Clone War, and so to ensure that when he did fall to the dark side he had Maul kill Qui Gon Jinn so that the apprentice would be unable to appeal to his former master’s remaining light. What happened to Maul after was of no importance to Palpatine since he was then going to recruit Dooku.

A side effect of this assassination of Qui Gon was that his apprentice, Obi Wan Kenobi, would be traumatized by the loss of his master, and given that Qui Gon had determined to train Anakin, Obi Wan would carry on his legacy and train the boy. This traumatized Obi Wan would then play a pivotal role in Palpatine’s scheme. He would surely teach his expert knowledge of the Force, which of course Palpatine desired, but also pass on the poor emotional coping skills that were part of the flaws of the Jedi. This led to Anakin’s emotional immaturity and shortcomings that would lead to his eventual downfall to the dark side. By becoming a mentor to Anakin, he would be able to monitor his eventual apprentice’s emotional state to determine when it was time to trigger his fall to the dark side, and when he did, Dooku was cast aside. 

Ahsoka was a liability to Palpatine’s plan. The bond between master and apprentice would likely have been strong enough to return Anakin to the light, which is why I believe Rex was the first clone commander given Order 66.

And that is why Palpatine was a long game playing genious.",Palpatine is a genius

StarWars,"Watching all the films and TV series, one could say that Sidious abandoning Maul for dead in TPM set off a chain of events which led to his undoing in TROS:  


1. If Sidious had not abandoned Maul on Naboo, Maul would not have become a crime boss.
2. Without Maul to lead them, Crimson Dawn would never have come into existence.
3. Without Crimson Dawn, Han Solo would not have met Lando Calrissian.
4. If Han and Lando had never met, the former would never have won the Millennium Falcon.
5. Without the Falcon, Han and Chewie would never have met Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Skywalkers.
6. Without Han, Luke would never have had the opportunity to destroy the Death Star, Vader would have unwittingly killed his son, and at least one of the Skywalkers would have perished at the Battle of Yavin.
7. Without the destruction of the first Death Star, Sidious would not have been motivated to use himself as bait during the Battle of Endor. 
8. Without all the Skywalkers surviving the Battle of Yavin, the son would never have turned his father back to the light.
9. If Anakin had never turned back to the light, he would never have killed Sidious as the Chosen One.
10. If Sidious had not been killed at the Battle of Endor, he would not have created Snoke as a puppet to turn Ben Solo to the Dark Side.
11. If Ben Solo had never turned to the Dark Side, Rey would not have awakened to the Force in the way she did.
12. If Rey had not discovered the Force on Starkiller Base, the Force Dyad between her and Ben would not have become a reality.
13. Without Rey and Ben working together, Sidious' plans for Rey to succeed him would not have been foiled.
14. Referring back to item #3, if Han and Lando had never met, Lando would not have become an ally of the Rebellion.
15. If Lando had never become an ally of the Rebellion, he would not have destroyed the second Death Star, and he would not have been present to rally the entire galaxy to the Battle of Exegol!

In the final analysis, Sidious' failure to rescue a defeated Maul on Naboo was one of his greatest mistakes. Since he was able to retrieve a mutilated Vader from Mustafar years later, there was no reason why he could not have done the same for his first apprentice.",Abandoning Maul in TPM: Sidious's fatal oversight
StarWars,"- Non Spoiler Post -

I want to thank Dave, &amp; Lucasfilm for making a great series and letting us see how this series closed out. From Geonosis to Order 66, The Clone Wars is and always will be one of the Greatest stories ever told in The Star Wars franchise. I remember when previews came out for the animated movie back in 2007-08, then the movie all the way to the series. The Clone Wars will have some the greatest memories in my childhood all the way till now. My one wish is that we could see more Clone Commando action, but the whole entire series delivered amazing battles, story arcs, and introduced new characters. Clone Wars forever !",Clone Wars
StarWars,"I just need to express how amazing I think this episode looked. Growing up I enjoyed watching the live action movies, but this last episode hit different. Don't get me wrong  the story was great, and Ahsoka and Rex are awesome. The visuals however just felt perfect. It didn't really click until this last episode for me. Ahoska falling through space looked great, especially the lighting and textures. And then on the ground with Rex, Ahsoka, and Vader. From the burn marks on the helmets, to Ahsoka's entire character model and the way her robe was flowing. And finally the imperial ship and Vader. His movement was incredibly smooth and the snow made everything just look that much better. Whether it's more Clone Wars or a different show, I think Disney should continue this style and quality of animation. Interested to hear your thoughts on it, do you think there is any animation style superior to this?",This episode (12) looked better than any other TV of Movie I have ever seen and it is the way I think Star Wars should be produced.
StarWars,"So, we know Jedi are pretty heavily inspired by Samurai given their sense of honorable or atleast mythic warriors, whose main skill lies in the usage of swords, who act as guardians for the people at large and adhere to a very strict code of conduct.

Sure the comparison isn't perfect but they do act and fight like how one would expect a modern samurai to...atleast in a Sci-fi capacity.

That got me wondering if the Mandalorian's one of the few groups or orders of people held in a similar high regard to the Jedi would be the Ninja Equivalent. They certainly fight more like Ninjas since they rely more heavily on various weapons, tricks and deception in battle rather than relying more on swords like the Jedi do. Also the fact most of their weapons and culture was developed to combat the Jedi much like how Ninjas themselves were originally ordinary people who developed skills and weapons specifically to counter the Samurai. 

Sure the comparison isn't perfect like I said, but I do feel like there is atleast some argument to be made.",Are Mandalorian's the Star Wars equivalent of Ninjas?
StarWars,"May the fourth be with you all! Happy Stars Wars day.

So, I've never seen the entirity of the Star Wars franchise. My parents are fans of the film and my sister has seen Star Wars too. While I've never watched the movies growing up, my childhood has consisted of seeing Star Wars posters, playing with Star Wars toys and owning the DVD's. The only films I've seen entirely are 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Rise of Skywalker' (please don't grill me) due to my parents wanting to drag me to the cinemas to see them. I must say I really enjoyed 'The Rise of Skywalker' more than 'The Force Awakens'. Other than that, I have seen video clips of the movies online and know the general storyline and plot of the movies. And I obviously know Darth Vader is Luke's father.

So I've been thinking to myself on whether I should watch the rest of the films. When my parents get the 'Rise of Skywalker' DVD they have this idea of doing a Star Wars trilogy binge before Christmas. I'm considering joining them so I can see all the movies for the first time.

What do you think? Should I watch them?",I've never seen the entire franchise. Should I? (May the fourth be with you!)

Is there anything that fills in the timeline between ROTJ and TFA? Anything that fills in Han and Leia's life together? Sorry if this has already been asked, or seems basic. I've tried to do some research but there's tons of books and only some are canon now? Anyway, thanks in advance for any direction!",Book recommendations?

After he failed to capture her he tried to find information regarding her last known recorded location. Why else would he be on that planet?,Where is Vader at the of episode &amp; how many years after the clone wars?

StarWars,"Despite the Ahsoka novel no longer being canon (I think it's the first disney star wars content to not be considered canon), I still recommend the book and just wanted to give some thoughts between the novel and the new clone wars episodes.

I'd like to start by saying that the new clone wars episodes are AMAZING and I'm very happy with how the show handled the Siege of Mandalore arc. I'd like to establish that I have no qualms with the Siege of Mandalore arc and am even happy that such a good arc is able to replace the Ahsoka novel in canon.

That is to say, I still recommend reading the novel (or listening to the audiobook). Even if it's no longer canon, or at least most of it no longer is, it's a wonderful read.

There are some parts I like more in the novel than in the new arc, such as Ahsoka's banter with maul about being half a sith, the parts after order 6y regarding how Ahsoka got her new lightsabers etc. But overall I do believe the new clone wars episodes are better and am happy that it's the new canon.

To get to the point, reading the novel does not take anything out of the experience even though it's not canon.

Tldr, I still recommend reading the Ahsoka novel even though it's not canon.",Recommending to read Ahsoka novel even if it's no longer canon

StarWars,"I love Star Wars so god damn much it's impossible to put it into words. I grew up with the prequels and originals and have always loved these movies.

I rewatched Episode 3 yesterday and god the ending just breaks my heart. I startes watching Clone Wars recently and I already love every single clones, they're humanized so well and it's so easy to care about them. Same with all the others, I love Anakin and Obi-wan even more thanks to TCW.

A lot of the time I wish I lived in Star Wars, I mean what a universe it would be to live in. Imagine being a Jedi! Seeing all these cool places, meeting so many great characters. Sometimes I want this so badly, just to get out of the real world, it hurts. The closest I can get to that is listening to the music or playing the games. 

I just love it so damn much, I'm sure so many people can relate. I sadly can't say I enjoyed the sequels, but I've got so much more that I can and do enjoy, and I'm so grateful for that. Not all the movies are perfect, everything has some flaws, but I still love them dearly.

Thank you George Lucas for creating this, thank you to all the people who've worked on Star Wars and thank you to the community who keeps on supporting it and keeping it alive. I think I might be feeling extremely nostalgic rn, but I do love this franchise very much. It's been a big part of my life, and I'm very grateful for it. 

May the Force be with you all, always!",Happy Star Wars Day (+ appreciation post)
StarWars,"Much in the same vein as DC's animated films. They could try out different animation styles for different projects. They could adapt different forms of Star Wars media such as comics and novels. Making an animated movie is nowhere near as expensive as a live-action movie is, and it's not as big a commitment as a TV show is. They'd also be the perfect testing ground for new characters, or even old characters they want to put into their big movies. Disney+ is already the perfect place to put these movies but I'd still want Blu Ray's made. I've recently been reading the Thrawn trilogy so I'd love to see them adapted.",Disney should make animated Star Wars movies
StarWars,You know what’s hilarious is that Rian Johnson’s trilogy would make soo much money because people hate him soo much they’d pay to see his movies just to write and record 3 hour hate videos on YouTube lol. Knives out also made a ton for its budget 160 for a 40 mil budget and Star wars 9 made 300 mil less he didn't hurt the brand it'd still make cash regardless just like Lucas which they swore he ruined their childhood and made a documentary hating on George. people hated the prequels and people still payed to see them.,Rian Johnson's Star Wars trilogy would still be successful
StarWars,"I know it's been a while but I just hadn't been able to watch it before...

I'll be honest, up until TFA dropped I hadn't watched any of the movies, so I didn't grow up with all the fuzz about the movies, and I do believe that affects the way I get the movies.

So... First, I believe this trilogy is built on nostalgia, in bringing old characters back and tell a story that is only written to allow the oldies shine.

Second... What the hell was that kiss? 

Third... Palpatine talks about a powerful bond not seen for centuries, why didn't we get this explained? on TLJ we could've had an explanation about how Ben and Rey were connected and also we could've known she was a Palpatine descendent (I truly feel that they ran out of ideas with this Palpatine heritage thing and that that is why it appeared just on Rise)

Fourth... What was the point of Rose during the second movie if she was going to be on stand by all the third one?

Fifth... Poe is my favorite character.

Please tell em what you think!",So I just watched the last movie and I have questions
StarWars,"Many seem to be very upset with the sequels for apparently ruining Anakin's Legacy and muting the prophecy he allegedly fulfilled when he defeated Palpatine. But, as to the release of Season 7, I've begun to watch The Clone Wars all the way through.

You may know where I'm headed with this. I just finished ""Overlords"" Episode 15 of season 3, where pretty much the Gods of the Force, or at least, the closest thing to it, asked him to remain on the planet and maintain the balance between two avatars of the force, representative of The Light and The Dark.

He refused. 

To that end, is it not true that Anakin failed? Was this not the moment that he was supposed to fulfill his destiny? I mean, a prophecy is a prediction, isn't it? Not necessarily a concrete description of the future.

To me, it seems Anakin's chance to do his job was missed. The avatar of the dark killed that of the light and subsequently, the entirety of the Jedi order was murdered.

""The balance has been broken""

Perhaps ""balance"" was killing all three avatars and leaving humanity to decide their own fates?",Regarding the Prophecy
StarWars,"Note: The reason TCW S7 got polished is because the fans + Filoni rallied for many years, and finally we achieved our goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr Dave Filoni, here is an idea a large chunk has been proposing for many years (and I am certain it has probably crossed your mind aswell), please push to make this happen:

&amp;#x200B;

tldr at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

**Synopsis:**

A new animated Star Wars series set after Revenge of the Sith and set many many years before Rebels, I am talking about 1 or 2 years post ROTS here.

The story will be about Vader and the rise of the Empire during the prime years of the empire, executing the Jedi purge with troopers (Transition from Clone to Normies) and some senate stuff.

*Title suggestion's:*

* *Vader*
* *Rise of the Empire*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Animation style:**

The animation style will be that inbetween TCW (Prequel Vibe) and SWR (Sequel Vibe).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:**

I understand that making a series of full 20 min episodes featuring Vader could be taxing on his presence, one thing I have noticed is that Vader is only present in the franchise for ""necessary"" moments; this keeps him as the mysterious dark figure we all grew up to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution:**  
Make the episodes as small shorts, perhaps 5 - 10 minute episodes each -&gt; Totaling the length to 60 - 90 minutes. This way there is no need to saturate Vader's character and appearance -&gt; Instead it can be shown as another Star Wars story, on par with the quality of a movie.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Pro's:**

* We get to see a visual depiction of the Great Jedi Purge.
* We see the Republic's transition into the Empire (Senate + Military).
* Commander Cody training Imperial Recruits.
* Possible Kaminoan Rebellion Arc.
* We see more Order 66 + the after effects of Order 66.
* Animating the series rather than live action will allow a lot more flexibility when creating.
* Happy Star Wars fan's.
* Happy Disney with all the money they are making with Happy Star Wars fan's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Con's:**

* It may take a bit of convincing to get Disney to agree to this.
* We may have to wait 2-3 years for this to become a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know other people's opinions on this idea.

**TL;DR:** A proposal for a new Star Wars animated series set after Revenge of the Sith focused on the Jedi purge and the Imperial Senate.","Dave Filoni - I know you want this as much as the fans, please make this Animated series:"
StarWars,"Just a thought I’ve had:

The final arc of TCW season 7 was obviously designed as a 2-hour film to be released in 4 parts. You could literally merge the episodes together and title it “Star Wars: The Seige of Mandalore”. 

Disney has been pretty clear that this is the final season of TCW. However, I think it’s very possible they will produce a few feature films covering some of the arcs we never got to see - stuff like Crystal Crisis, Ventress &amp; Quinlan Voss, Battle of Mygeto, etc. 

Disney+ could easily produce a 2 hour Clone Wars special annually for a few years. Maybe I’m just being hopeful...",More animated Clone Wars movies theory
StarWars,"In honor of May the 4th be with you I’m sharing a fun post about my favorites in Star Wars. You all should share your  favorites also!

1. Favorite non-force user: Captain (Commander) Rex. Rex has been my favorite for a while, since the show began in 2008. Wonderful character growth and built Anakin and Ashoka as characters.

2. Favorite force user: Luke Skywalker. Luke has been my favorite since I was a kid. I always hoped to be as cool and determined and caring as Luke was. 

3. First movie seen in theaters: Attack of the Clones. I was 6 when I saw this and it blew my mind seeing all of the Jedi on screen. Still one of my favorites. 

4. Favorite movie: Return of the Jedi. Hands down my favorite. Completes Vader’s redemption, Luke is a great leader and Jedi. Possibly best in the saga.

5. Favorite show: The clone wars. Adds so much to the lore and builds on characters we only saw glimpses of.

6. Favorite quote: Yoda to Luke in Ep. VII. Yoda tells Luke to pass on what he has learned. 
“Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also, yes failure most of all. The greatest teacher failure is.” This quote resonates with me because I’ve had a few mistakes in my life but I’ve learned from them and it reminds me that we use these mistakes to grow and help others in to be better.

Happy #maythe4thbewithyou 

And thank you to @hamillhimself @iamraypark @instadaniellogan @ashleyeckstein @jatactor and so many others for bringing these characters to life and being such a fun and important part of so many lives.",My favorites
StarWars,"After seeing Maul's entire journey in the series and how he was saved from being a simple sith with a cool lightsaber to a complex character with a grey morality that everyone loves I wish that Dooku had had the same love in his development. In Clone Wars he barely has any changes in his personality and, in fact, we hardly see any ambiguity in his actions. We as fans know that he hates the corruption of the Jedi and the Republic, and how, using the Separatists and Palpatine, he wants to inflict a necessary change to the Galaxy. His political ideology, his subtlety, is something that is lost in the series in my opinion. And since Dooku is my favorite character it hurts a little how it has been treated over time.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Am I a fool for wanting more for an interesting character, or is general consensus that Dooku wasn't that interesting and he fulfilled his role as a character?","Honestly, I wish Dooku could have gotten the same development as Maul."
StarWars,"Just been thinking the past few days and with seeing the end of Clone Wars ( no spoilers at all) just now, i'm feeling a bit nostalgic.

What is the epitome of Star Wars to you? 

For me it's always been Obi Wan and Anakin.  Those two going on their adventures in the prequels, Clone Wars series, even the video games like Lego Star Wars and the movie adaptions for PS2. Thats what I think of when I think of Star Wars. Thats who I emulated when acting out scenes with toy lightsabers as a kid.

I'm not sure anything in Star Wars is going to capture that feeling for me like seeing those two together did and it's got me a bit sad that with clone wars done for good I'll probably never see them two together again. That is unless theres some flashback shenanigans in the Obi Wan show if thats still happening.","What is ""peak Star Wars"" to you?"
StarWars,"I'm beginning my Star Wars Day celebrations in the morning where I'm gonna make my way through all 12 movies. 

Except this year instead of doing it all in one sitting I'm wanting to go ALL OUT because I'm not sure if I'll get this chance again.

So I'm planning to add in both the clone wars and Rebels into the mix, which is gonna take a few days as it is so to help counteract it a little I'm planning on condensing it down to what I think needs to be watched for: Self Contained plot, Overall impact, Sheer awesome factor... Basically only the important bits like the return of maul and the good bits like the Citadel arc.

This is the list I've concocted so far.


-Malevolence Arc (S1 It was the only good arc from the first season 

-Clone Cadets(S3) good episode and contextualised Domino squad

-Rookies (S1) see above

-Arc Troopers (S3)see above

-Ryloth Liberation Arc (S1) the only other good arc

-Brain Invaders Arc (S2) explores the relationship between in Ahsoka and Barriss

-Mandalore Voyage Arc (S2) Mandalore plot

-Cat &amp; Mouse (S2) fun episode that tied to the movie

-Boba Arc (S2) non essential but I feel it was needed for Boba Plus it gave a little more context for his later appearances

-Nightsister Arc (S3) begins the Maul arc, plus it also contextualised a lot of the NS and Dathormir appearances

-The Mortis Arc (S3) I kinda feel this is self explanatory

-Citadel Arc (S3) it's my favourite arc in the entire series, if you don't feel the same you don't have to... But you might be confused when Echo suddenly isn't there anymore

-Chancellor Assassination arc (S4) my Third favourite arc you don't need to

-Dathormirs fall and the return of maul arc (S4/5) more maul which is the recurring them for this season

-Fall of Mandalore and Ahsoka leaves arc (S5) grouped these together because they're back to back but it's all basically set up for the Siege of Mandalore (also 2 Amazing stories in their own right) This is also why point rain is in the list


-Conspiracy Arc (S6) Amazing emotional arc and sets up Order 66

-The Lost Ones (S6) The Tie In to Sifo Dias was really cool, and the order 66 part was the reason I put it here

-Force Ghost Arc (S6) or Yoda's arc, this is hear for the same reason Mortis is

-Bad Batch Arc (S6) it's a great Arc over all

A Thing to note is that the Siege of Mandalore is here but I would be watching it after Revenge of the sith.

I'd like some constructive criticism here of what people think in general, if things should be put in or taken out etc. And also I'm wanting to build a list for rebels  so if people could help with Taht I'd be really appreciative.",I've come up with a list of Arcs and Episodes for the clone wars down to the important bits and wanted people's opinions.

Leave your opinion in the comments.",My top ten of the entire Clone Wars series.
StarWars,"I really don’t understand why people are excited for the new series because they haven’t created a series on a character that fans love like Ahsoka, Darth Revan or even a series or trilogy on the old canon story after Ep. 6(Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo and Anakin solo.) Instead they have chosen to give, in all honesty a minor character, from a spin-off film his own series. And while I get that K-2SO and Cassian were popular it’s annoying as they could do a similar type of show but for Ahsoka when she went by Fulcrum, and she is a character that almost everyone loves and has been a major part of the Star Wars universe.

Also, a different annoying thing I have about Star Wars Disney, I am so frustrated by the fact that in the sequel trilogy and spin-offs there has been hardly any new, exciting ships designs, which bugs me as a big fan of space battles. I mean the most unique, and good, design of the Disney era is the the U-wing which I actually really like, but when you look at the Sequel trilogy there is honestly nothing new. I mean out of all three films pretty much the only new ship in either the FO’s or Resistance’s fleet is the SF-17 bomber which is terrible(I’ll talk about it later.) 

It just annoys me to help though thinking about how much better the prequels were, apart from the dialogue, just because they introduced interesting planets, cool ships, for the most part good characters, new species and most importantly actually seemed innovative. Whilst the Sequel trilogy literally rips off the OT.

So, I’m going to talk about the SF-17 bomber now, even though it’s been two years since TLJ. I’m literally going to just make a comparison between the Y-Wing and the SF-17. For one thing the SF-17 was a newly built ship yet it moves 100x slower than the Y-Wing which was made 50 years ago and still works at that time. Another thing, the SF-17 has a crew of 5 people, and can still be easily destroyed, meanwhile the Y-Wing can fly with just one pilot and an Astromech for Navigation/Rear gunner. 

It’s all of those comparisons that make me think has anyone whose part of the Sequel trilogy ever actually seen Star Wars.

I know that lots of other people share this opinion but seriously, we need to just boycott Disney given how much they are ruining an amazing universe, and to the  people that like the new films and like what Disney have done is just show them that Disney are trying to change the dating system from BBY/ABY to BSI/ASI. Which is so retarded as that would put Ep. 1 at 62 BSI whilst Ep.7 and Ep. 8 would be 0 BSI and 0 ASI. And the final film, Ep. 9 would be at 1 ASI, but with the Battle of Yavin used as the dating system you would have Ep. 1 at 32 BBY and Ep. 9 at 31 ABY, which I think everyone can agree is the hugely better system",Am I the only one who isn’t excited for the Cassian Andor series?
StarWars,"After seeing The Rise of Skywalker in theaters my wife and I decided to do a whole watch through of all the Star Wars movies and shows, starting with The Phantom Menace. She had never seen all of The Clone Wars or Rebels before. We were able to finish season 6 of Clone Wars right before season 7 started. 

After about a month of only one episode a week, we got impatient and decided to start Rebels while also keeping up with the new episodes of Clone Wars (which was an awesome decision).

Earlier this week I realized we had the chance to watch A New Hope on May the 4th if we sped up our viewing. After 25 episodes in 5 days and watching Rogue One tonight, we will be celebrating May the 4th by watching the series finale of Clone Wars and A New Hope.

I hope you all have fun celebrating watching, reading, or playing your favorite Star Wars stories. 

May the Force be with you.","Tomorrow I will be celebrating May the 4th by watching the newest piece off Star Wars media, followed immediately by the oldest."
StarWars,"What did you feel when you first saw the trailer to ""The Force Awakens""? Hope?

What after you saw the movie? Nostalgia? Disappointment?

How about the Trailer to ""The Last Jedi""? Hope again?

And the movie? Surprisement? Excitement? Disappointment again?

Now comes ""The Rise of Skywalker"" Trailer. Still hope?

I hoped till the last second of the movie. Maybe it was naive or the longing for sense. That in the end they would come up with an explanation to all those plotholes and unbelievably convenient coincidences.

The movies of the latest trilogy can be criticised on many levels. They also did things right and showed us amazing moments! But those only linger. Thus they don't remove a feeling they shockingly created. A feeling that is far worse than any technical critique: The feeling of not caring anymore.

I was a Star Wars Fan. Since i was a kid and my older brother showed me the old trilogy in secret because our parents wouldn't let me at my age back then. We always had that connection and talked about the movies, books, games and the overall lore. But not anymore. Because we don't care anymore.

Yes i watched all of the new trilogy at first chance in cinema. But i never thought i would walk out of a Star Wars Movie thinking about it like Transformers: ""at least the effects were amazing"".

I want the STORY to be amazing! In the old trilogy our beloved characters developed while they undertook an epic journey at which they had to tackle challenges, suffer losses and make sacrifices to achieve something of importance.

SPOILER WARNING FOR IX!

Nowadays all it takes is an uninspired version of a former frightening villain who melts himself with his own lightning blast because he didn't force-foresee the power of an extra lightsaber wielded by his indestructible granddaughter who conveniently became ""all the jedi"" in the same timeframe in which the legendary Luke Skywalker couldn't even lift an X-Wing out of a swamp!

Yes, maybe the last part is exagerated and false. But as i said: i don't care. The writers didn't so why should i?

I once loved a universe full of believable characters, surprising storys and mystic adventures.
That is gone because of an advertisement for merchandise which is devoid of established logic.

TL;DR: If you feel anything like me then don't just use #maythefourthbewithyou to show love to a once fascinating universe. Add #maythestorybewithyou to remind Disney that all we want is a great story.


Please Disney:
Make me care again

StarWars,"Star Wars is eternal, but it doesn’t help the fact that with the final episode of the Clone Wars, the final piece of George Lucas Star Wars is coming to a close. Dave and the rest of the team have done beyond an incredible job of sending this era of Star Wars off with the biggest bang they could; we may never truly get ANYTHING prequel based again. Regardless, not hating on any kind of Star Wars, just been thinking of how I wish it could go on forever. Midnight will be hit hard tonight everyone. I’m glad we could all take this ride.",Nothing but bittersweet waiting for the final episode to drop.
StarWars,"There is a roughness in the sequel trilogies. Its hard to describe but it feels like an even more decentralized and scattered Galaxy. Idk if I make sense but for example the Knights of Ren and Kylo having an unstable light sabre with the hilt guard. The brute force aesthetic of the First Orders AtAts and Star Destroyers who in many ways feels weaker than the empires. The resistance being an even more outdated and weaker rebel alliance.

We went from Civilization in the prequels to the tyranny of the Empire and now its a devestated post world were the structures of power have been reformed into dust. Its a galactic dark age, not due to the first order but every side trying to exist as a weak mockery of what came before. 

It feels like Medieval europe to the Roman Republic and Empire and its end is the final start of an attempt to recreate. With Luke's death the last of the Old Jedi are gone. Eventually new dark siders will rise but hopefully also a new galaxy not trying to emulate the past but create something new.

Fyi I still wish Rey didn't adopt a last name, kiss Ben or just most of the sequel trilogy feeling like it made sense. But thinking of it like this kinda makes me appreciate it somewhat. I just wish they had been more bold with the saga. Made new designs etc.",The One thing I do like about the Sequel Trilogy.
StarWars,I've done some digging into this but all I could come up with was that he wanted other people to tell Star Wars stories. it seems odd he'd do this since he had three more movies plan. Did he just think Disney was going to make them then they screwed him over? If he did think that why didn't he make them guarantee it? Or why not hire someone else to make them or sell them to a company he had more control over? This is especially interesting because he seems like he's not a huge fan of the new movies and am wondering how he feels seeing the direction of new Star Wars stories.,Why did George Lucas sell Star Wars?

StarWars,"I just want to congratulate Dave Filoni and his team for creating this show. I only just began watching it when Disney + came out and I was hooked immediately. The characters were the true pull of this show for me and seeing them deal with real problems in real and deep ways made this stand out from the first episode. The final episode of this show is one of my favourite episodes of tv of all time. The cinematography is just incredible with some truly terrific shots of Ahsoka in her robe mirroring the end of rebels while also conveying so much raw emotion. The final shot of Vader reflected in the destroyed clone trooper helmet sums up the true purpose of the show and shows how Ahsoka and Anakins relationship grew and became more strong with time and ultimately the image  reflects the two characters we love in what they have become. The music is absolutely incredible in this show. Towards the end of the episode the music is some of the best and most fitting for a scene in Star Wars and carry‘s the raw emotion held in the scene. I love this show and this was a truly incredible way to end it. I don’t think I would have any problems calling characters like Ahsoka my favourite in all of Star Wars and would have no problem calling this some of my favourite Star Wars content out there.

Thank you to Dave Filoni and his team for creating this absolute masterpiece.",The end of the clone wars
StarWars,"
Now hear me out, some of you will argue that it’s the Original Trilogy because that set it all up, because Empire Strikes Back is the greatest of the movies and it has the best acting. True, the Original Trilogy is amazing, but the Clone Wars era is the best aspect of Star Wars and here’s why... 

When we begin, we are thrown into a galactic war between the Republic Government and the Separatist Alliance and the story mainly follows Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex. 

These Characters progress brilliantly from beginning to finish. When we begin, we see Anakin as brash but light and full of determination that nothing could stop him. At the end, we see him angered, lacking trust in his order and feeling abandoned by his friends. Obi Wan is wise and cunning, back went through so much during these 3 years. Maul’s resurgence, the death of Satine, having to survive the war and Order 66 and to face his brother. Rex at the beginning was heavy in spirit and committed to defeating the droid army and at the end he is conflicted on the point of it all, why did so many of his brothers have to die. 

And last, but not least, Ahsoka at the beginning is arrogant and lacking experience in life, but she progresses so beautifully as a Padawan and person, she makes mistakes, as everyone does, but leaned from them naturally and became skilled and strategic, but was betrayed by her order and left as a result, leaving Anakin feeling abandoned himself. The character development is the most definitive and excellent of all the Star Wars characters.

Also, in Clone Wars, it feels like an action war, in the Original and Sequel trilogies barely any characters who we connected to died. In war, there will always be casualties and that’s something a bit lacking in these trilogies. Whereas, in the prequels and Clone Wars, you have characters like Qui Gon Jinn, Hevy, Fives, 99, Gregor (at the time before Rebels), Satine and Savage. It presents an actual war spread through seven seasons.

I would like to thank George Lucas and Dave Filoni for their creative vision and determination in preserving this series and making it the best Star Wars series of all time. Thank you!",Why Clone Wars is the best aspect of Star Wars
StarWars,"My relationship with Disney and Lucas film is a mixed relationship, I like what they have done with the tv shows and Games. And the Star Wars stories movies (rouge one and Han Solo) however I dislike the the sequel trilogy, but when I heard about the renewal of the clone wars I was thrilled and exited of what might come. As well as anxious of the potential that Lucas-film and Disney could destroy my childhood show, but when the episodes where released I was pleasantly surprised and relieved that Dave Filoni and the team at Lucas film where able to re create the anxiety and betrayal we all felt in revenge of the sith. 

For that, I want to thank you. You have made my childhood memorable!

What is everyone’s favorite throwaway scene/line from the Star Wars saga? We all know the classic moments and lines, but what about those hidden gems that stand out to you?

Mine is from TPM: Near the end of the podracing scene, Sebulba throws a spare part over his shoulder and destroys the podracer of Mars Duo. Just before he crashes, he lets out a solid “Eraauuuuu!” Not sure why, but I always laugh at that moment and it’s long been an inside joke between friends.",Favorite throwaway scene/line?
StarWars,"I liked the episode. It was brilliant, but I just want to know if I am the only one who thinks there is missing something?

I personally think between the moment Rex and Ahsoka land on the moon and the Empire/Vader scene, there should have been at least 5 more minutes. Maybe narrated by Obi-Wan's message of the fall of the Republic and the jedi order. Then we would have seen Ahsoka and Rex going separate ways and Rex hinting that other clones could still be saved from the inhibitor chips and we could have also got to see a little of the galaxy during the montage. 

Additionally the moment Ahsoka leaves the grave morai (the bird from rebels which also flies above Vader in the finale) should have been seen watching her in the background.

And the clone helmet in the last shot of the episode should have been without any legion markings or with blue for the 501st.

StarWars,"It was the night before May the 4th. 

Not a Jedi was stirring, not even a Padawan;

The Lightsabres were hung, on the rack with care.

In a hopes that Anakin would soon be there.

The Younglings were nestling all in their beds.

While visions of being slaughtered came to their heads.

And the groundskeeper settled down for a nice long nap.

When out in the plaza there arose such a clatter.

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the window with  a wave of a hand.

The Moon on the stairs of the overarching Temple.

The silver Moon giving way to objects below. When what my wondering eyes did appear.

But an army of Clones, led by a hooded figure.

I knew in a moment he must be Skywalker. More rapid than Eagles his Clones did come.

As he pointed his Lightsabre and shouted their orders.
""Go forth!"" ""Go forth!"" ""They all must burn!""

To the top of the stairs! On the top of the wall!

Now run away! dash away, run away all!

As the dead bodies did fly.

When met with an obstacle, Sabre ignited.

So gunned him down the Clone troopers did.

With an army of Clones, and his Sabre ignited.

And then in a banging I heard on the walls.

As I drew my head, and was turning around.

Out through the door Skywalker did come.

Dressed in black from his head to his foot.

And his boots all tarnished with dust and debris.

A Lightsabre ignited he had in his hand.

And he looked like a monster just waiting to strike.

His eyes-How yellow they glowed in the dark.

His cheeks were pale, his face deadpan!

His mouth was shut, closed as the door.

The clench of a fist, he, narrowed his eyes.

And the dark, encircled his body like a cloak.

He had long hair, and had a metallic hand.

That whirred when he movied, like a rusty old clanker.

He was tall and lean, a menacing fellow.

And I cried when I saw him, fearing for my life.

A flourish of his Sabre, and a footstep forward. Soon gave to me know I had everything to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work.

And raised up his Sabre; and swiftly struck down.

And de-igniting his Sabre, attatching to his belt. Giving a nod, out the door he strode.

He returned to his Clones, and with a nod gave the order.

And away they all marched, down the halls in unison.

But Skywalker exclaimed, as he walked down the corridoors-

""It has been done my Lord""",May The 4th be with you all!!

Some of us haven't even seen TCW. I think the show serves the same purpose as the x-wing book series or the Thrawn trilogy did.

It sucks he never got to see the ending of the season. 

By time the post mortem and registration of his death was done, without realising it, I’d arranged for his cremation to occur on Star Wars day. I’d already picked that he’ll enter the crematorium to Binary Stars.  

It’s so very fitting for him as the giant Star Wars geek that he was and as sad as I am about losing him, I’m happy knowing that he’d have loved the fact today was the day of his cremation.

For the first part if the film, the queen of Naboo is played by a decoy, whilst the true queen adopts the role of handmaiden

My question is, to what extent does the decoy stay a decoy and not become the actual queen. This person calls herself the queen, acts as the queen and sends various messages/transmissions as the queen. The true queen however, spends the whole time serving, is ordered to clean a droid, AND DOES IT. 

To the extent this decoy is implemented, she may as well be the real queen. The reason the Trade Fed wanted to capture the queen was to sign a treaty. Were they planning in signing the treaty and then claiming its null and void because this person who did everything a queen does wasnt technically the queen?",Could someone explain the whole decoy queen element of TPM
StarWars,"It seems since the movie came out, I'm one of the only ones who actually REALLY enjoy TLJ. I really don't understand the hate for it other than maybe one or two things. I think it's one of not only the best Star Wars movies, but one of the best movies in general. It's beautiful, deep, unexpected, true to Star Wars and legacy characters while giving us something new and fresh.

This is my favorite Luke Skywalker movie. I think Hamil's performance is top-notch, and his character arc in this movie was perfect. He's a Skywalker, of course he's going to be dramatic by running away from everything. He saw what the legacy of the Jedi brought to the galaxy. It brought war and conflict while the Jedi were pretending to be peace keepers. After what happened to Kylo, I can understand Luke not wanting to be a part of any of it anymore. In his mind, he was making the better choice by staying out of everything. But the point of his arc was that he was wrong. The galaxy really did need a hero and a legend. He realizes that through Rey and Yoda, and he did one of the most Jedi and Luke Skywalker things ever by being a distraction to let the resistance escape and giving them hope while apologizing to Kylo and coming to terms that he will not be the last Jedi and there's still hope for them. That's so beautiful. God I can't describe how perfect that is.

The movie was BEAUTIFUL visually. Luke walking out to face the entire first order on Crait, oh my god. The tree burning scene with Luke and Yoda, the hyperspace through Snoke's ship, Ach-to, it's all so beautiful. 

I loved the force connection between Kylo and Rey. It was something new and it really built their connection. I loved Rey's want and need to be a part of something bigger, wanting to have important parents, but realizing through the force vision and Kylo that she DIDN'T need that. She could make her own destiny and shouldn't rely on others. Rey had a villains backstory while Kylo had a hero's backstory, yet they turned out opposite. That's art. 

There's so much more I can talk about like the entire Luke and Yoda scene, Luke training Rey, the music, Poe's arc, and yes even Finn and Rose's arc. I just wanted to share a few things on why I loved this movie. I would have to rank it #2 right behind ESB and right in front of RotS. 

What do you guys think about the movie? If you don't like it, tell me why. I would love to have a discussion about it.",Are there any other huge TLJ fans out there?
StarWars,"I just finished listening to ‘Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View’ audio book and I am in complete shock. For those who are unfamiliar, it is a collection of 40 short stories that was released for the 40th anniversary of A New Hope, and it’s absolutely amazingly well done. 

The stories are all told by and about characters that are either in A New Hope or very closely connected to, and all of the stories relate to famous scenes from the movie giving you an unexpected and refreshing new point of view on scenes we know and love. If you aren’t a fan of Star Wars books because they can feel a little too removed from the storyline we know and love in the movies, then I highly recommend giving this one a shot. 

The audiobook version is brilliantly done. They use just enough official soundbites of blasters, explosions, TIE fighters etc without over doing it. And the voice actors at times are SPOT ON, it’s a real joy to listen to. I was so surprised at how much it felt like an extension of A New Hope. It’s as if you’re watching the same movie we’ve loved for so many years and all the sudden the camera turns 180° and starts following a different character in the scene. Grab yourself a glass of blue milk and settle in tomorrow and give it a listen or a read. 

The nostalgia is so strong with this one. Trust me.",If you’re looking for some seriously unexpected nostalgia tomorrow and want something new on May the Fourth...I highly recommend the book ‘Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View’
StarWars,"

 the Sith bend the code or ""make the code work for them"", by that I mean that they will do things and try to excuse themselves in the code, being selfish, power hungry and basically just pushing their own agenda; after all, most Sith don't even care about the Empire and it becomes rather obvious if you play a full dark side sith.

Lana on the other hand believes in the Freedom part, power allows you to make your own options and, of course choose the fate of your lesser; although it's hard to know if she truly cares about her people or if she only sees them as tools. So in the end, she is the only ""true"" sith, since most reach their freedom by seeking power but don't realize that their own greed for more power enslaves them. Lana know her limits, she knows what must be done, she knows that the search for power never ends, so she seeks power in others where she can use to help and save the Empire and, subsequently, The Galaxy.",Lana beniko is the one true sith Lord
StarWars,"We see the Separatist killing civilians, torturing prisoners, etc. Therefore as kids, we all thought that the Separatists are evil. However, there is no reason at all for the Separatists to obey any martial law as the Jedi break martial law all the time too. In the case that there was no martial law in star wars the argument would have to change a bit: There is no reason at all for the Separatists to follow any ethical standards as the Jedi break them all the time. 

My line of argument will be based on the geneva conventions.

The first war crime in the clone wars series is perfidy, also known as false surrender.

* In the battle of Christophisis Obi-Wan pretends to surrender to buy time for Anakin to win the fight
* In the Battle of Ryloth Anakin claims to give himself up if the Republic was allowed to bring humanitarian aid to Ryloth. Instead, he flies a cruiser into the Separatist command ship
* In season 7 Anakin fakes surrender kill the commander of the local separatist forces

The Jedi torture prisoners of war

* Anakin force chokes a prisoner from Geonosis
* Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, and Anakin torture Cad Bane

The Jedi use child soldiers

* Underage padawans like Asokah act as commanders of the republican army

The Jedi kill/ try to kill enemies who surrender

* Mace Windu tries to kill Palpatine
* Anakin kills Count Doku

The Jedi force soldiers from the enemy side to fight for them

* To infiltrate the citadel Droids are reprogramed",The Jedi are just as evil as the Separatists

To me the Republic appeared to not give a flying fuck about things like suffering of sentient life so did they think the Republic would just like execute the clones ore just cut them loose to room the galaxy causing trouble.

StarWars,"This is just my thoughts on the matter. I’ve been thinking a bit on why people disliked the sequels. Personally, I thought they were good as individual films, but don’t produce a concrete trilogy and don’t mesh well with the previous films. I decided, just for fun, to try to come up with my own sequel trilogy. When I did this, I realized that the task was nearly impossible. Let me explain.

I am of the opinion that if you are going to continue a story, in either sequels or prequels, what you add needs to enhance the original story and feel like it’s not really separate from the original conflict. Let’s take the prequels as an example. What did they add to the original story? Well, they added more character depth to Kenobi and Vader and they gave us an idea of who the Jedi and Republic were. This meant that we gave more of a shit with the original trilogy. They also expanded the story to include Anakin being prophesied to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force, which he ultimately does in Return of the Jedi. Again, it enhances and adds to the original story. I say this as someone who generally dislikes the prequels as films, but likes them on the basis that they did add to the story. So what was the story about when the prequels were added? It was about Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who was destined to bring balance to the force, turning to the dark side due to Darth Sidious, who desired to bring the sith back and throw the force out of balance, and then being redeemed through his son, Luke Skywalker, and then destroying the sith and bringing balance. At the end of return of the Jedi, the sith were destroyed, the empire was on the run, and it can be assumed that a New Republic is going to be built and the Jedi will be restored. The story was ultimately about bringing balance to the force. Now comes the question. What can be added to the same story?

Well, nothing. The conflict was resolved. If you throw the force out of balance again, or bring back the sith, then you have undermined the point of the original story. And if you use new villains, then it’s not really the same story anymore. It may involve the same characters, but it’s not really tied with what came before. You can tell stories set after Return of the Jedi, but they won’t be apart of the same story the first six films were telling, and you might risk contradicting the original story. Return of the Jedi brought a proper end to the story that neither needed, nor could have a continuation. This is why no matter what they did the Sequels would always be problematic.",Star Wars should not have had a sequel trilogy at all.
StarWars,"So I have a question, because at the end of this new trilogy there is only 3 force users left who arent spirits, there is rey, finn and that sweeper boy. So lets assume for a moment the force continues on through bloodlines and doesnt end with those 3, what exactly is there to prevent a jedi from going dark and doing this force war all over again? Cause jedi arent machines that come out on an assembly line with no emotion, no thoughts of their own, all it takes is one dark jedi and this starts all over again",[spoilers] A question about the sith in the future
StarWars,"Why wasn’t Luke and ex machine the whole time? Well it’s simply bc Disney didn’t want him to steal the new characters thunder. ( in other words they wanted to sell merchandise more then tell a story) 

Dave Filoni, John favreau and Kevin Feige understand this more the Kennedy ever could, if there is only one reason for the hiatus between films it is to work out this problem at the top. I’m sure when new movies come out Kennedy will not be part of it. THANK GOD! 

Here’s to 2 trilogies and 3-4 spinoffs over the next 10-15 years with animated and live action shows tying it all together the way clone wars and rebels did such a great job at. 

While we all want an original story some sort of reboot is necessary to compete with the first 6 movies. 

So we need the Jedi to come into power once again and then face a menacing threat that actually wins in the first trilogy and then the 2nd is about removing that threat...then maybe we can get a third trilogy that actually takes us somewhere amazing. And actually tells an original story about victory over everything. W o rehashing old storylines and bringing back the deceased",Sequel trilogy sucked bc it was not producer driven. The first 6 films produced by Lucas had different directors for ESB and ROTJ. A set script was followed. KATHLEEN KENNEDY unfortunately didn’t do much producing by letting Rian Johnson take full control. She singlehandedly ruined ROS.

StarWars,"This is a galaxy with a population well into the trillions, if not much higher.  The separatists can produce many times the number of clones they said in the movie.  The 1.6 million number we get in attack of the clones just makes no sense, especially considering they were produced to combat battle droids, which can be produced at a much much faster rate.  I mean, 1.6 million clones really shouldn’t even be enough to take one very well fortified planet.  Think about it this way: 1.6 million men wasn’t enough people to invade WWII era Germany, yet the republic was regularly taking and then defending planets.  It just seems to me that there should be more like billions of clones than the, comparatively speaking, very small figure we get in AOTC",It always bothered me that there are so few clones.

StarWars,"The second episode of the new trilogy, revolves around a rebellion space ship who is escaping from the first order, ignoring the stupidity of the people involved and how bad the film was, especially considering fuel was never an issue in no star wars film before this, according to newton's first law, since in space there is no air, and in that moment: no gravitational pull or any other forces influencing the trajectory and speed of the spaceship, couldn't they just go full speed for a second and then turn off the engines? They wouldn't be wasting fuel and would still be moving at top speed. If this right, is Mickey Mouse just a bigger idiot than I thought or just an idiot alongside me?","Question about space and ""Fuel"" in star wars."
StarWars,"So I've been thinking about this while trying to not be as frustrated with The Sequels as much as I am:

What if Palpatine being a clone in The Rise of Skywalker was a contingency plan like Operation: Cinder from Battlefront II. But he was a failed clone that the real Emperor Palpatine passed his consciousness into shortly after Vader killed him in Return of the Jedi. 

  
Being a failed clone, meaning this is technically a new character holding the mantle of Emperor Palpatine. This explains why hes a complete idiot when it comes to planning, but is still Sheev enough to be recognized by Luke and the OT gang (and apparently the resistance too).

  
This wouldn't change the fact that the Sequels are a bad trilogy overall, but it can somewhat undo the damage the Sequels did to the Original 6 Movie Skywalker Saga. This way, Anakin is still the Chosen one and he did bring balance to the force.

Idk, it seems like a better explanation than that the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.",Penny for your thoughts...

Basically overpower the opponents with sheer strength and hope they can't hold up as that is all that is really needed

I mean as far as Vader is aware the Jedi Order is dead, there are no combatants alive that could match up to him. Even blaster wielding foes are no problem to a Jedi/Sith","When engaged in lightsaber combat, did Vader have any tactics other than brute strength?"
StarWars,"I honestly hate that they make the clones turn into “zombies” who are brainwashed because of the inhibitor chip and kill the Jedi because they can’t help it. It takes out the human in them and makes them seem like droids that are programmed for a single task. Clones were originally just soldiers who followed orders because their allegiance to the republic topped any allegiance to anyone else. Old canon didn’t have an inhibitor and they simply followed orders. 

Order 66 is a regular order that anyone can look up including the Jedi. The order basically allows troops to terminate any Jedi who is a traitor, which is the same order that allowed dogma to kill prong Krell. 

Also, if you don’t consider the inhibitor chip, clones are soldiers who are primarily loyal to the republic and chancellor, and that beats any loyalty to the Jedi. I’d like to believe that they had no chip and followed orders simply because at the end of the day that’s where they’re allegiance lies. 

If anyone played the original battlefront 2, you would know that the clones were torn apart from the order but chose to follow because they are soldiers and didn’t need a chip to follow orders. By giving them an inhibitor chip, it takes away the emotions simply to make the clones look like they had no choice.

StarWars,"I'm not going to sit here and argue whether or not the new trilogy is good or not, and let me know if this has been brought up before, but Rey in all three movies sustains almost no *major* injuries.   


I was just thinking about it with a friend and we were talking about how Anakin gets horrifically mutilated at the hands of Count Dooku, and then again by his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi. On top of psychological trauma like watching his mother die in his arms, and being a slave as a child with his mother, and nearly dying in a pod race for mysterious space wizards who just wanted money to go home.

And then there is Luke who was protected by his friends and Ben for the most part in A New Hope, but he gets almost killed by the Wampa, his hand is cut off by Darth Vader, his aunt and uncle who were his strongest parental figures were burned alive by the empire, he watched his new friend get killed in front of him, is almost killed by a monster and squished in a trash compactor, he loses Biggs who was his childhood friend, he found out the identity of his father and then saved him only to have him then die in his arms, watched Yoda die in front of him, he was almost murdered in front of his father by Palpatine, and on top of it all he kissed his own sister. 

Rey was thrown into a tree by Kylo Ren knocking her out cold for a good amount of time but there was little to no noticeable physical damage to her, she definitely would have broken bones but you could never tell, she sees that Finn got hurt badly but didn't really have to worry about it because he ended up being fine. She loses Leia which absolutely is painful but was not as traumatic as watching someone you love dearly die in front of your eyes. All of the ""damage"" she takes is more or less completely unseen. You don't have to see someone get hurt to know they are hurting, but it just makes Rey feel even more infallible and overpowered.

Thus, they push the boundaries of cinema in ways that are fundamentally incompatible with the diluted, executive-driven processes employed by corporations for their valuable IPs. The virtues/values of SW (under Lucas) are fundamentally incongruent with ""story-groups"", or trying to push social agendas, and MOST importantly...  innovation.

I have been listening to a lot of Lucas interviews/ideas/articles, and the thing that stands out is that Star Wars literally CAN be anything. The guy made something unique, and yeah it is cool to hate on prequels and whatnot... but the GL literally said ""screw that noise"" and just stuck with the story he wanted to tell. His ideas are BOLD, and showcase an affinity to cinema that is almost unparalleled. He is an artist of an umpteenth degree, and I'll stick to that belief to the very end.

You got the most bankable franchise because of Lucas.

Not Iger, nor Alan Horn, Kennedy, def not creatives like Abrams or Rian. Their attempts at bottling that spark of Star Wars ultimately led to shrinking the visionary tenants the franchise was borne from.

It's not just guns going pew-pew, nor massive destroyers with a bad guys cloaked in black, nor is it a multitude things that will take a better part of the day to list.

It's all encompassing. It is cinematic tenants stretched in ways that are seen as unorthodox. It's built on non-conformity.

SW is silly, and experimental, and all-encompassing when it comes to cinema, and brings all that to the forefront. Largest art-house franchise in the world? YUP.

It is what led to its success, and the model needs to be fundamentally revamped if it is somehow to work under Disney (It won't. Quality might improve later on, but their model as of now is not indicative of being able to tackle this franchise the same way Lucas did.)

I honestly would've loved to see LucasFilm stay a private corp, but now they are beholden to share-holders and executives lending to many cooks in the kitchen.

Star Wars IS dead.

And no I am not talking in monetary terms. There is money on the table and a lot of it (vastly due to Lucas and all others who worked with him closely having the massive influence they've had)

But, the artistic inclinations it was built upon are dead.

Not to sound too pessimistic, but Star Wars as a brand is a different beast now. Don't judge on what came before, and maybe you can find some different artistic inclinations that might resonate with you.

Nothing lasts forever my dudes, and there's beauty in impermanence. Create something beautiful, and let it burn... art, bruhs.

TLDR: Star Wars as IP is too big. Disney loves money. Disney run by shareholders/executives. Disney wants as much mass-market as possible. Process of pleasing many people is detrimental with artistic inclinations being thwarted. So, Star Wars is a different beast now. Different art. Embrace that and don't be disappointed. Maybe.","Star Wars films are experimental, span multiple-genres, and highly technical. Thus...."

I also want to say, f*** whoever thought killing her off in the start was a good idea, she had so much potential in Star Wars, so much she could’ve done, so much we could’ve gotten with her, but no, apparently it’d be better if she was killed off in the start and never spoken of again. That is probably the only reason why I hate The Last Jedi.


One more thing, to give you a understanding of how much I love her, I’d rather be her more than me, I don’t care if I die at the same time, would be much better than my life now. I also (please don’t judge me) dream about different scenarios where she survived, for example, she was late, or got out of the hangar in time, or took off in time.

StarWars,"Solo-7/10 I liked this movie a lot but I found myself bored during the final 30 minutes of the film. 

The phantom menace-9/10 I throughly enjoyed this film and though liam neeson was a great qui gon. 

Attack of the clones-8/10 I didn’t like this as much as the phantom menace but I still loved it. And paddle was definitely my favourite character in this film!

Revenge of the sith-10/10 I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this film by far my favourite prequel. 

Rogue one-6/10 pretty average but I really liked the ending 40 minutes.

A new hope-10/10 instantly loved this film and already planning on watching again.

The empire strikes back-10/10 my favourite Star Wars film definitely a movie I will enjoy more and more with each rewatch

Revenge of the Jedi-9/10 my least favourite of the the OT but I still liked it a lot and it was an amazing end to a perfect trilogy.

The force awakens-7-10 I really liked this film a lot but I didn’t think it did anything particularly great.

The last Jedi-1/10 I HATE this film.

The rise of sky walker-3/10 I dislike this film quite a lot but it had some great moments.",I have just watched every Star Wars film for the first time and here is what I think of them!
StarWars,"I was rewatching The Rise of Skywalker and I once again came across the scene where Kylo heals Rey with the force. I have asked why Obi-Wan hadn't kept his master from dying and I have thought about the plot hole that they created in doing this but since there has been time for Disney to explain the whole force heal thing, is there a legitimate canon explanation as to why Qui Gon Jinn was not force healed when he easily could have been? Not hating on the sequels or anything I am just genuinely curious. Thanks :)",Canon Explanation for Obi-Wan not force-healing Qui Gon?
StarWars,"Ok so like a little under a year ago I had a dream about a Jedi padawan that got injured. Cant remember who it was or who his master was. It felt so real though, I also dreamed it in the clone wars animation, it was kinda weird but anyways. Later that day I had gym and we were playing frisbee and it was pretty windy and the idiots on my team just kept chucking it as was as they could. So basically I was doing nothing, I started day dreaming and expanding the dream I had the night before, and basically since then I have kinda been expanding it in my mind building more characters strengths and weakness to the characters. Im kinda obsessed now with my alternate universe. I also kinda reused some characters, such as Siri Tachi. It takes place during the clone wars and yes I know she died. But it my dream and she is legends anyways so she’s not dead, instead of getting shot in a place that would kill her she got shot in her leg or something. I haven’t read the book, just the stuff of wiki so I don’t know it that would work it’s just my head canon with my limited knowledge.

Anyways getting to the point. I recently started making a Google docs righting down everything that happened to these people, and every thing about them. I did this Because things kept getting lost in my mind and I couldn’t remember everything. For a few weeks now I thought of making it in to book form, but the thing is I’m a terrible writer I mean look at my grades. But I got bored today and decided why not if it was shit I could just delete it later. I’m on chapter 3, I don’t think it’s terrible, it’s definitely readable and I have done a lot better than I thought I would. Anyways the story itself is kinda long, but there’s sections I half the first half all built in my head I just need to write it. 

Now of course some characters I most certainly did not create such as Siri, Anakin, Ahsoka, obi-wan, Rex, the Jedi council peps, and so on. 


Some character names I have created are

So yeah, the name of the book is *In The Darkness.* as you can see in the title.",In The Darkness
StarWars,"I see people say Anakin was a bad seed in AotC and we see nothing good about him but I disagree. In the opening chase we see Obi Wan and Anakin bantering as they chase down Zam through the city and in the arena fight as well. There is clearly a bond between them like big and little brother. I also see people say that murdering younglings wasn’t a shock because he killed the tuskan raiders but it’s pretty obvious the sand people aren’t viewed as ‘people’ but monsters

Even then I disagree with the idea Anakin should have been completely noble and idealistic. In Empire when Yoda says to Obi Wan Luke has too much anger in him like his father (at this point Luke doesn’t know Vader is Anakin so I doubt Yoda meant Anakin in the present)

Sure some his dialogue is a bit clunky and cringey but I don’t think Anakin was all bad. We see his softer side along with his anxiety",Why do people say Anakin was a bad seed in AotC?
StarWars,"Just a fun what-if I wanted to make. Enjoy!

Everything would stay the same until the scene where kylo reveals Rey is a palpatine. Rey attempts to jump onto the falcon, like she did in the film, but is pulled back by kylo, with the force. The falcon is shot down by stormtroopers and crashes on kijimi, exploding. Finn protects Poe 3po bb-8 and d-o with a force bubble, which is how it is revealed he’s force sensitive. Poe says something like; “is this what you were going to tell her?” Finn nods. 

Then, as they try to repair the damage to the falcon, the knights of ren show up. Cue epic fight, in which Poe, Chewbacca, and Finn take on the knights of ren. Finn uses some sick force powers, and even kills one of them. A giant avalanche happens, causing a wall of snow to fall between the knights and the rebels. They go back to kijimi, where they explain to zorri the situation. 

Kylo attempts to take Rey to exegol, but she ends up snapping, using the force to make his ship crash in an asteroid field. They have the same fight that they would have had on the Death Star ruins, but instead on these asteroids. This would be a space battle, with them jumping from asteroids, and using the force to form air bubbles around themselves. The fight ends  with Rey electrocuting kylo with force Lightning, and she ends up taking kylo’s ship to kef bir. 

Meanwhile, the knights of ren call for backup, and sith troopers are deployed on kef bir.
Meanwhile, babu frik reveals he’s been building an army of droids, featuring b-1 battle droids, droidekas, b-2’s.. just a whole bunch. Babu also shows Finn a mega droid he had attempted to construct, powered by a damaged lightsaber. As the droid army fights the sith troopers, Finn attempts to fix the lightsaber. 

Meanwhile, Rey lands on kef bir, where she finds the ruins of the second Death Star. The same thing happens as in the movie, but instead of dark Rey simply spooking Rey, they end up having an extensive dual, which ends with Rey getting bombed by the knights of ren, having arrived to destroy the way finder. 

Rey fights them, and is overpowered. But then, kylo arrives. He claims he needs Rey to live, but the knights refuse, claiming that Rey needs to die. Kylo and Rey end up battling them, ending with a total wipeout of the knights of ren.(one or two of them have ambiguous deaths, such as being force pushed off the ruins. This is so they can return in future content.) kylo tells her that they need to go to exegol, but Rey attacks him again, exhausted. 

The same thing happens that happened in the movie, and the film goes the same way, until Rey leaves ach to. Since Poe and Finn are on kijimi, other resistance fighters get a chance to shine in this final battle. A much more intense space battle occures, with, instead of just having to take out a power signal, we have a prequel-like battle in the skies, with the return of ships like mon calamari cruisers. Meanwhile, The battle is looking hopeless for the droid army, as they are being overwhelmed. Then Finn emerges, with the lightsaber repaired, glowing with an emerald blade.

The movie goes the same, and it’s intercut between the space fight, Rey kylo and palpatine on the surface, and kijimi. Rey is about to kill palpatine and complete the ritual, when ben arrives, and Rey and him attempt to Overtake palpatine. They are beaten by him, and, Rey reluctantly agrees to do the ritual. Kylo objects, and pleads to palpatine to possess him instead. Despite reys objections, ben does so, slaughtering palpatine and allowing him to possess him. 

Palpatine, now in bens body, falls on his lightsaber with the force. He ignites it and duals Rey. Eventually, ben regained control temporarily, and kills himself by stabbing his lightsaber through his chest. As he dies, he tells Rey that he’s sorry. The movie continues as it did otherwise, with the rebels destroying the fleet, and the sith eternal falling. 

Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca, along with the droid army, beat the sith trooper Army on kijimi, and everyone reunites on Ajan kloss, where they learn of leia’s death. They mourn, but celebrate her, and the heroes of the rebellion that led them here. We flash forward years in the future, at night. R2 is outside the new Jedi temple, projecting a hologram to a floating cloaked figure. The hologram ends, and the figure floats off into the night.

IIRC Anakin never said this, and further Obi-Wan talks about Anakin as though he was a separate person from Vader (bc everyone doesn’t know the twist yet) so he’s definitely talking about Jedi Knight pre Mustafar Anakin.

StarWars,"I was rewatching Attack of the Clones yesterday and noticed that the Republic becoming aware of the Clones was due to a series of lucky coincidences that even Sidious couldn’t have planned. 

- Jango sends Zam to use killer millipedes. 
- Obi-Wan leaps through the window and manages to grab the droid, which comes flying back to Zam. 
- Zam shoots the droid but Anakin manages to catch Obi-Wan and they manage to spot Zam and go after her. 
- They manage to keep up with her and follow her to the bar. 
- Zam decides she’s going to try to kill Obi-Wan rather than sneak out the bar while they’re distracted. 
- Jango managed to track them to the bar and rather than shoot her, hits her with a poison dart that he got from Kamino. 
- Obi-Wan only finds out about Kamino after going to Dexter, after Dooku painstakingly deleted all references of Kamino from the Jedi Archives.

But Rogue One was excellent. I loved it from start to finish. The ending fight scene was great. There were so many amazing scenes. The story, although it was really only written to explain a plot issue with the Death Star, was actually pretty good. Character development was good, the characters were interesting and entertaining. 

It was also the first Star Wars movie where there wasn’t a sudden heroic rise at the end where the heroes manage to win and escape death. They achieved their goal. But practically all of them died in doing so. I even liked Krennic as the villain. Mads was obviously brilliant in the movie as he is in everything, and K-2SO was actually the first time I’ve appreciated comedic relief in a Star Wars movie for a long time. I just thought it was brilliant and really don’t think it gets enough recognition for actually managing to live up to the high standards of the original movies, and while it isn’t as good as them, it still hit the nail on the head with practically every aspect of the movie.",Rogue One was Great
StarWars,"In the late 70s/ early 80s, I was not alive, however the portrayal of the Jedi were cunning warriors, peacekeepers of the galaxy, people you dressed your kids as for Halloween. Not much was known about them since they were all dead in the original stories we grew to love, Other than Luke, who truly became a real Jedi at the end of ROTJ, and solidified what it meant to be a Jedi. Someone with composure, self control, and upmost humility. (which is why I’m not a fan of the direction luke was taken in TLJ, but that conversation is for another time and doesnt matter right now)

Fast forward to George Lucas’s prequels, when we finally got to see what the Jedi order was like. They were portrayed as extremely flawed and egotistical, which ultimately lead to their failure.

And you know what? that’s pretty genius and genuinely such and interesting idea. I believe it’s a great story that the Jedi were responsible for their own downfall.

As more and more Star Wars canon was added, the clone wars, and a line in TLJ where Luke tells Rey how flawed they are. We have come to only know the Jedi as selfish and failures. Even Ashoka no longer claims the Jedi as her people.

Which once again I will say, is a great story to tell, and it has been told.

Reys story kind of embraces the positive traits of the Jedi and I love that about her, but I never got the feeling that she truly understood what being a Jedi is about, and I don’t really consider her to be an ideal “Jedi” at this point, she’s just a good person who follows a path that enables her to help people, and she happens to have a connection with the force.

But i really believe it’s time to bring back the word “Jedi” and make it an optimistic and hopeful word, someone you aspire to be like. Someone we wanted to be when we were kids, maybe a storyline where someone accepts the flaws of the Jedi, but chooses to move past it and and embrace all of the positive qualities of the Jedi. 

Maybe even training a new era of Jedi, and redefining them so they are made into what Jedi were originally thought to be.

tl;dr: I’m a rambling idiot",I really want a storyline in a film/series where the Jedi are redeemed/ brought back to the original “heroes” they were originally portrayed as while also respecting canon.

StarWars,"# Order 66 / The Chip

**I have questions.**

* So, let's say you knew about order 66. If you sent a holo message of a convincingly Darth Sidious looking dude saying ""execute order 66"", would they then go jedi-genocide?
* Does the chip programming end? Or is it it like popping a fuse and that's just how they are now?
* It seems like many of the clones were genuinely fond of their Jedi compatriots, how did that affect their psyche after order 66? Maybe the chip affect is permanent just to stop them from mental breakdowns?
* Could trauma/electricity/other damage to/around the chip enable/disable it?
* Obviously not every clone saw the Sidious message, how did they go all order 66?  Is it a social cohesion thing where they see other clones attacking jedi and so that means ""I guess it's jedi killin' time!""
   * If that's the case, why didn't it become a massacre when Tup killed Tiplar in The Clone Wars?

**An answer: Secret Handshake?**

I actually think it might have been an interesting touch that there was a kind of secret handshake, magic word, or other secondary trigger to cause a clone to trigger another clone. So, instead of all the other clones in the area seemingly miraculously instantly being on the same page about it, there would be a wave of murderous intent, which could have interesting story / scene / cinematic implications. You wouldn't necessarily need to explain it, you could just show it, and I think it would be pretty clear what was happening.  
But that doesn't appear to be what happened.

Alternatively...

**Answer: Clone Genocide Pulse?**

*OH! I got it! I'l make an excuse for Star Wars!  Time to jump through some mental hoops for a clever retcon... Star Wars style! Seriously, that's a giant chunk of Star Wars since Empire.*

Anyway, what if each clone had \*two\* ways to go order 66?

1. Direct order from Darth Sidious. This causes you to go order 66, but at the same time emits some kind of pulse to all other clones in the area.  Presumably this would be powered by some kind of biological energy store, probably good for 1 shot.
2. Receive the order 66 pulse from another clone, then send out that order 66 pulse to make sure you get everyone in the area. Clones far away from the original order could still be in murder mode almost instantly.

*This brings up new questions:*

* Could you stop them from going order 66 if you stuck them in a Faraday cage?
* Does Tup's malfunction mess up this idea?
   * I guess not necessarily, but it seems like he likely would have triggered the other clones. Makes it suddenly a little bit more of an odd stretch, but nothing crazy. I work as a programmer. Bugs do strange things sometimes.",Order 66 / Compliance Chips - I have Questions. Also: Genocide pulse idea

I mean, it would be a pretty cool story. 
For example a poor farmer who's family died and the jedi just did nothing to safe them, so she wants to get the force to help those who the jedi ignores.

StarWars,"Vice Admiral Holdo gets a TON of shit for not disclosing her plan way earlier, but I’m not going to touch on that further. 

My question is: why couldn’t the “mutineers” have simply told Holdo

&gt; Hey, I don’t know what your plan is, but we have a plan that gets us literally light speeds away from the FO, and here’s our pitch

They didn’t have to “mutiny.” 

I put it in quotes because it’s not really mutineering when they all have the general shared, broad goals. 

They still could have pitched the plan — which IMO would have been approved by Holdo since it’s sacrificing 2 for a 100% shot of saving hundreds rather than hoping that the FO doesn’t realize that dozens of carriers going to the nearest/only inhabitable planet are evacuating — and she could have still rejected it, and they could have still mutineered and had gone with the plan anyway.

**TLDR — nobody chiming in with, “well, Poe should have pitched their own sound, reasonable plan to Holdo instead of hiding it as a mutineer”? Even if he got rejected, what changes if they go on and mutiny all the same anyway?**","(The Last Jedi) TLJ spoilers, also controversy incoming.

StarWars,"So before I get crucified I just want to say that I *did* enjoy the episode overall. It was good. Nothing life-changing, but good. 

However, ever since the episode landed I've been seeing countless threads on this sub with titles along the lines of ""This is the greatest thing to ever come from Star Wars"", ""thank you Dave Filoni for reigniting my love for SW"", ""OMG, I'm STILL CRYING after this"" etc etc.

Am I the only person here who thinks there's just TOO MUCH HYPE over this episode? Even just a tad? 

Like I mentioned, I did enjoy the episode; but on imdb this episode is listed as the fourth highest rated episode of any TV show. Ever. It wasn't THAT amazing! I honestly though the two ""Seige of Mandalore"" episodes were considerably better.

Some 'issues' I had with the episode... 

1. The Darth Maul hallway scene was ripped straight out of Rogue One. I don't have a problem with this in and of itself but the praise for this scene has made me realise that there is a HUGE double standard when it comes to the fan base.

It's like: Disney copies something from OT = ""bad writing""; TCW copies something from Disney movie = ""Dave Filoni is a genius! This is the best thing SW has ever done!"" 

2. Order 66 was kind of underwhelming. Having spent the last two weeks marathoning TCW and Rebels, I already knew Ahsoka and Rex were going to survive order 66 and go on to have a strong friendship. Yet everyone on reddit is raving about how ""tense"" this episode was. 

Also, in Rebels, Rex mentioned he had his inhibitor chip taken out, but we're led to believe this happened BEFORE Order 66, not AFTER the order had already been issued. And what about Wolf and Gregor (if I remembered their names correctly)? When did their chips get taken out? 

3. Am I the only one who had a problem with Ahsoka **willfully** freeing Maul so that he could kill some clones all for the sake of a distraction? I mean, I get that she was in a tough spot and I suppose it isn't the worst tactic given the circumstances. My problem is this: throughout the show Ahsoka is regularly shown as being a good person with a high moral code, one who has developed a close relationship with the clone troopers, so the thought of her intentionally freeing Maul **knowing** that he was going to on a murder spree with these clones (what if Maul killed Rex?) didn't really sit well with me. It felt out of character for Ahsoka. At no other point throughout the show do I recall any instance where Ahsoka willfully put others in danger to save herself. Again, I realise she was in a tough situation but it just didn't sit well with me. 

Anyway, thanks for hearing my rant I guess lol. I'm still looking forward to the last episode, I just hope it's better than this one. This episode didn't live up to the hype for me. 

What do you guys think? Does anyone agree? Or am I just some kind of madman for thinking this?","Am I the only one who thought ""Shattered"" WASN'T all that great?"
StarWars,"My personal ranking is 

- Star Wars Galaxy Adventures. 
- Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)
- Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003)
- Star Wars Resistance 
- Star Wars Forces of Destiny
- Star Wars Rebels 

To me, Galaxy Adventures is the peak character design and style in the Star Wars universe. 2008 Clone Wars is probably the most recognizable and well-known after the canon movie designs, and even with giraffe neck Anakin, 2003 Clone Wars has a classic and nostalgic feel to it despite the crazily exaggerated proportions. Resistance has a slew of great character designs, even if the shading/shadowing in the animation looks strange at times. Forces of Destiny is not really that well known, and some of the character designs/animation is straight up not good (Leia for instance), but Anakin/Padme/Obi-Wan have solid designs, and Yoda doesn’t look like a ketamine soaked loaf of bread. Which brings me to Rebels; I don’t actually hate the design in Rebels, the quality is there and the animation moves fluidly. It’s that after The Clone Wars, something about it is so off-putting, IMO. Maybe it’s because everything looks like it’s been put through a slimming filter (looking at you Ahsoka), I don’t honestly know. If I could base it off Anakin-Vader and young/old Obi-Wan’s designs alone, it’d be near the top. But then there’s non-Vader Anakin and his floppy hair, Sidious's weird chin and chiclet teeth, and of course, the infamous and much hated on Yoda. Overall the bad character designs overshadow the good ones for me. 

I’m curious to hear other opinions though!",How would you rank the character designs and quality of the Star Wars animated series?
StarWars,"I refer, of course, to the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each race has a lot to them, but how well do you think they could do in the SW universe?

Here are my thoughts on each faction:

**Terrans**  
They'd stomp in ground fights with Marines, Siege Tanks, etc., but in space battles they could be beaten by Star Destroyers. However, the Terrans have much easier cloaking access, so Wraiths could take apart Star Destroyers. The Death Star could be a problem, but a few Ghosts could take it out if they infiltrate it.

**Zerg**  
Totally overpowered. The Star Wars universe has never (to my knowledge) faced an enemy quite like the Zerg. Any planet would get overrun in days, and in space battles they'd never be able to handle that many Zerg. Sheer numbers alone would win the Zerg many a fight, but their adaptability would also ensure the SW races wouldn't be able to effectively counter them. The Death Star could be easily infested by the Zerg, and its weapon would not be truly effective against them since the Zerg don't really rely on any one planet.

**Protoss**  
Overpowered. They would dominate ground fights with their Zealots, their Templars could be a handful for even the most powerful Jedi or Sith, and their capital ships would decimate any SW fleet. Plus the Protoss have plenty of planet-destroying weapons, so the Death Star wouldn't beat them.",How well do you think the Starcraft factions would do in the Star Wars universe?
StarWars,"In finale of Episode 9 Rey travels to Tatooine, finds an old Luke's place, then called herself Skywalker.

Why she did that? I have an answer. She is mother of Anakin Skywalker. She traveled not only to Tattoine, but back in time to give birth for Anakin. Obviously, she was impregnated by Kylo Ren, when he healed her. It was made through the force, so there is why Anakin is so strong. 

An evidence for this we can find partially in Episode 1. Mother of Anakin tells that Anakin was like impregnated by Force itself. Well, technically it's true, because Kylo and Rey never had real sex (mostly due to PG-13 rating).

Another part of evidence we can see in Ep. 8, where she saw herself in that cave. She is past, present and the future. She is the time loop itself.

How she traveled through time? I dunno. Somehow. A lot of things going in Episode 9 somehow, why not this one?

Why she didn't fight back the raiders in Ep.2? Maybe, she lost connection to the Force during time travel.

So, she called herself Skywalker, cause she knew she will be the mother of Anakin.

But all this stuff leads us to interesting things. Kylo, in fact, his own grandgrandpa and he is father of his own grandpa. And his mother is own granddaughter. Palpatine is Anakin's grandgranddaddy via Rey. Family connections are complicated in this family.",I have insane theory. Rey is mother of Anakin Skywalker
StarWars,"Upon viewing the recent episode of TCW, in which Order 66 takes place and Ahsoka is on the run from her clones aboard the Venator, a few random questions popped into my head and maybe the answers are obvious.

Number one: what happened to Cut Lawquane when Order 66 was issued? If you remember, Cut was the clone who deserted the Grand Army of the Republic and started a family on Saleucami. Anyways, surely nobody contacted him about Order 66, but his chip was activated right? Would his demeanor change? Or would he remain the same as there were no Jedi present?

Number two: How does Order 66 work exactly? More specifically, why does Sideous even need to contact the clones and tell them to execute Order 66 if there are chips in their heads that can simply be activated? How many calls did he have to make? Because based on the context from the movie/show, he calls certain clone commanders individually, and then the commanders relay the massage to their men.

Again, the new episode got me thinking, and maybe the answer is right in front of me, but if anybody knows the answers, my wandering mind will be at ease. Thanks!",A few questions about Order 66
StarWars,"So I haven't watched rise of skywalker yet so my knowledge isn't complete which is why I am asking 

In the original trilogy prequels and comics we all know sidious wanted a true apprentice one that will surpass him 

In rise of skywalker sidious cloned himself but it didn't work because the citadel had not prepared yet as his betrayal happend earlier than expected.

So why not clone anakin/vader and teach him how to transfer his spirit into a new body 

He could have prepared a body and when it was ready he could have had anakin transfer his conciouness 

that way vader would be full power",Rise of skywalker plothole
StarWars,"Rogue One is unironically my favorite Star Wars movie, and I think a big reason why is that there's very little actual Jedi in the plot. I'm not quite on team EmpireDidNothingWrong but I must admit that the Jedi are just generally unlikable. They're arrogant and conceited, and despite the fact that Eepisode III is a meme and really not that great of a movie, it was honestly kind of satisfying to see the Jedi get taken down more than a couple of pegs.

Going back to Rogue One, it's fantastic not only because of the plot and the action and them actually sticking to the plot, it's fantastic because there's very little actual Jedi actually involved in the movie (and Ben Mendelssohn did a fantastic acting job as Director Krennic)",Did anyone else find the near total lack of actual Jedi involvement in Rogue One to be one of the best things about that movie?
StarWars,"I’m sure I sound stupid, but what was Vader’s position in the empire? Was he like the VP to Palpatine, or was that Tarkin? It seemed like he was the one sent to kill someone/deal with Luke, and didn’t seem to be appreciated very much at the meeting in the Death Star in ep4. Was it like Snoke and Kylo Ren where he was just kinda part of it because he was Snoke’s apprentice and he mostly just did his own thing?

Edit: Thanks everyone who responded, now I realize he was the Dwight to Palpatine’s Michael Scott",What was Vader’s role in the empire?
StarWars,"Note: this is MY opinion and you may comment any other ideas you have if you think what I say doesn't make sense or something.

Starting off, I think Palpatine isn't dead. Vader killed him in episode 6, and now Rey did the same in episode 9. We have confirmed that in episode 9 Sheev is a clone. So what prevents him from using the clones again after the events of episode 9? 

I think another movie to finish off the saga could work. Again, feel free to disagree, and I know that people will probably not like the move away from movie trilogy's, but if we get a movie that has Rey, maybe even some other characters that are still alive from TV shows or just people that haven't been killed off (such as the Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and Sabine). 

If a movie with all characters from all movies comes out, that is made well and isn't rushed, that takes time to think about and stuff, I believe the fan base would like it. 

Again, I'm not sure about this, it's just me thinking about it, I haven't asked any friends what they thought of it, any other opinions or feedback is welcome.",What I believe Disney could do to better the sequel trilogy
StarWars,"&gt; A silent buzzing vibration came from a compartment concealed within his armor. Cody frowned. ""Go on ahead, General. We'll be right behind you."" That concealed compartment held a secure comlink, which was frequency-locked to a channel reserved for the commander in chief. Kenobi nodded and spoke to his mount, and the great beast overleapt the clone commander on its way down into the battle. Cody withdrew the comlink from his armor and triggered it.

&gt; A holoscan appeared on the palm of his gauntlet: a hooded man.

&gt; *""It is time,""*, the holoscan said. *""Execute Order Sixty-Six.""*

&gt; Cody responded as he had been trained since before he'd even awakened in his creche-school. ""It will be done, my lord."" The holoscan vanished. Cody stuck the comlink back into its concealed recess and frowned toward where Kenobi rode his dragonmount into selfhessly heroic battle.  
&gt; Cody was a clone. He would execute the order faithfully, without hesitation or regret. But he was also human enough to mutter glumly, ""Would it have been too much to ask for the order to have come through *before* I gave him back the bloody *lightsaber*...?""

&gt; The order is given once. Its wave-front spreads to clone commanders on Kashyyyk and Felucia, Mygeeto and Tellanroaeg and every battlefront, every military installation, every hospital and rehab center and spaceport cantina in the galaxy.

&gt; Except for Coruscant.

&gt; On Coruscant, Order Sixty-Six is already being executed.

(I'm skipping the scene where Bail Organa goes to investigate the situation at the Jedi Temple)

&gt; Order Sixty-Six is the climax of the Clone Wars.  
&gt; Not the end - the Clone Wars will end some few hours from now, when a coded signal, sent by Nute Gunray from the secret Separatist bunker on Mustafar, deactivates every combat droid in the galaxy at once - but the climax.  
&gt; It's not a thrilling climax: it's not the culmination of an epic struggle. Just the opposite, in fact. The Clone Wars were never an epic struggle. They were never intended to be.  
&gt; What is happening right now is why the Clone Wars were fought in the first place. It is their reason for their existence. The Clone Wars have always been, in and of themselves, from their very inception, the revenge of the sith.  
&gt; They were irresistible bait. They took place in remote locations, on planets that belonged, primarily, to ""somebody else."" They were fought by expendable proxies. And they were constructed as a win-win situation.  
&gt; The Clone Wars were the perfect Jedi trap.  
&gt; By fighting at all, the Jedi lost.  
&gt; While the Jedi Order overextended, spread thin across the galaxy, each Jedi is alone, surrounded only by whatever clone troops he, she, or it commands. War itself pours darkness into the Force, deepening the cloud that limits Jedi perception. And the clones have no malice, no hatred, not the slightest ill intent that might give warning. They are only following orders.  
&gt; In this case, Order Sixty-Six.  
&gt; Hold-out blasters appear in clone hands. ARC-170s drop back onto the tails of Jedi starfighters. AT-STs swivel their guns. Turrets on hovertanks swung silently.  
&gt; Clones open fire, and Jedi die.

StarWars,"So I was playing Battlefront 2 (2017) and I noticed some blaster rifles, specifically the E-11, E11-D and A280  and likely many others had very clear parts that wouldn't initially seem relevant for a energy weapon, a magazine, a cocking handle and clear chamber, etc.  


Now to be clear I know that the original props were old ww2 guns, made to look sci-fi, but is there any explanation in cannon or legends that explains why the guns have these parts, or is it something we're meant to turn a blind eye to, because ***gun goes pew***",Is there an universe explanation for blaster rifles having ballistic rifle parts?
StarWars,"I have just finished The Mandalorian again, and in the last episode Moff Giden said something that left me wondering. He talked about the Siege of Mandalore, and some kind of ""Purge"", carried by the Empire. Now, I'm currently watching the Clone Wars flawless finale, the Siege of Mandalore, and I've seen said Siege, but carried on by the Republic, against the mandalorian's faithful to Maul, the Mauldalorians. 

&amp;#x200B;

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",darth plaugis
StarWars,"     I’ve always wondered if it would have worked out better if they didn’t introduce the inhibitor chip in Clone Wars. If you look at Episode 3 and the original Battlefront 2 it seems the intention was to have Order 66 be a code for if the Jedi ever went rogue, that Sidious just took advantage of. If they did it this way then it would have been left up to each clone to take out their respective Jedi and not mind control. I wonder if that would have worked better, with any clone that wouldn’t comply, due to a personal connection, being branded a traitor as well.
      I just thought about this again yesterday because the latest episode of Clone Wars sort of muddied how the inhibitor chip works, with Rex being able to communicate with Ahsoka while not having control over his actions.
      I know I’m arguing semantics over a poorly written scenario but I can’t help but wonder which way would have fit better.","Clone Wars, better without the inhibitor chip?"

So, why didn't the empire commission a bunch of these? I think I read somewhere it was primarily an assassin Droid. But even if they were super expensive or resource heavy to commit one Droid is worth dozens of troopers who need constant care and 100% loyal to it's protocol. 

I feel like an army of 100 of those dudes would be worth way more than any number of Stormtroopers. Is there a lore reason they didn't? Are these droids not actually that good and IG-11 was unique/plot deviced?",Question. Why didn't the empire use IG droids?

Last month however, Disney+ revealed that the last episode of TCW would be aired and I was curious. I started watching the clone wars and was completely hooked. I quickly realized that if I wanted to catch the series finale I would have to watch A LOT. I’ve been doing that for 2 days and realized o only have about hour and a half of clone wars left. Maybe it’s because I just watched the Ashoka episode but I just feel empty.

I’ve been so hooked on the series I never realized it would actually end - I feel absolutely heartbroken and sad. I intend to watch Rebels after TCW but was informed that it wasn’t that good. 

I JUST BADLY WANT THE CLONE WARS TV SHOW TO LAST FOREVER. Ik that sounds pretty selfish and I know it must come to an end sometime but I do not think any Cartoon Series ever could relocate the effect TCW has on me.

But they all are well aware that Ashoka is not a jedi, just a civilian and Maul is definitely not a jedi, yet clones tried to execute them both. My question is why. Especially considering that Rex is very close to Ashoka it seems hard to believe that he would not go by with the logic of 'I am ordered to kill jedi, she is not a jedi, I don't have to kill her'.

StarWars,"Is it just me or are the prequels closer to a Galactic Civil War than the Originals which we call the ""Galactic Civil War""

The Prequels are about thousands of planets that are leaving the Republic called the Separatists(People who want the republic to seperate). So we have 2 massive sides waging a War, with one side trying to keep the Republic together and protected, and the other trying to take over the Republic.

The Originals are about a group of rebels from certain planets, that are completely outnumbered by their opponent, which is the current government. So wouldn't this be more like a Galactic Revolutionary War? Or just a series of terrorist attacks on major military stations in hopes it will collapse said government.

StarWars,"I'm sure it goes without saying, but these last few *Clone Wars* episodes have been phenomenal and I figured I may as well add to the dozens of other posts on the matter. My hope for the very last scene would go something like this:

After faking their deaths (if that part of the *Ahsoka* novel remains canon), Ahsoka and Rex say their goodbyes and go their separate ways. Ahsoka boards a ship, perhaps the Silver Angel, and once in space she stares out among the stars. The music swells into something hopeful, but after a moment the score fades into something more ominous and the scene cuts to Darth Vader on the bridge of a Venator - also staring out into the stars.

StarWars,"So This Is An Idea I Had At One Point And I've Built Up On It Ever Since, Sorry If It's Bad...

So The Main Character/Protagonist Of The Story Is: Maxwell Lenoda (LEN-OH-DAH)

A Separatist Citizen In His Late Twenties Living On Raxus Prime Throughout The Clone Wars, He Would Be A Simple Guy Trying To Get Along In Life. He Is A Skilled Technician And Mainly Helps Maintain The Equipment In The Local Droid Foundry. He Keeps To Himself A Lot And Only Really Talks To His Colleagues At Work And His Little Sister Which He Holds Very Dear To Him. He Doesn't Care Much For The War Since To Him, It's A Distant Conflict That He'd Rather Not Concern Himself With.

The Other Main Character Is: Lily Lenoda, Maxwell's Younger Sister By A Few Years.

She Is A Carefree Girl Who Loves Her Brother Very Much, She's Also A Bit Of A Klutz, More Often Than Not Tripping Over Her Own Feet When Running Around. The War Is Practically Invisible To Her, She Know's There Is One, But Like Maxwell, Doesn't Care Much For it. Her World Revolves Around Her Brother, As She Is Very Clingy To Him, But She Does Know When To Lay Off.

The Two Are Inseparable, Only A Power Akin To A Thousand Suns Could Tear Them Apart.......Which Is What This War Would Exactly Do...

The Purpose Of The Film Isn't To Add Major Things To Any Existing Lore In The Series, But To Simply Describe And Show The Life Of The Average Citizen Of A Faction That Was Made To Fail...

The Film Wouldn't Show To Much Fighting As That's Not What It's Meant To Do, It Would Show The Inner Politics Of The C.I.S. In A Few Scenes But Not Too Much As To Not Bore The Viewer With Constant Bickering Over Internal Affairs.

However This Is Still A Star Wars Film, And So, In The Latter Half Of The Film, It Would Show The War Finally Reach The Confederacy's Doorstep, This Would Be The Only Major Addition To The Lore. The Battle Of Raxus Prime Would Be A Hard And Grueling Battle For Republic Forces, As The Separatists Had Fortified Raxus After The Failed Attack On Coruscant. It Would Show Separatist Droids And Even Militia Men Fight The Republic Invaders. Maxwell, Lily, And Many Other Citizens Would Simply Be Caught In The Cross-Fire Either Hiding Or Trying To Find A Transport To Get Them Off World.

The Battle Would Seem In The Separatists Favor, But Then Would Turn Sour As Order 66 Is Executed And The Droid Shutdown Command Is Sent Out, Leaving Only The Armed Militia Men To Fight The Clones. At The End Of it All, Maxwell And Lily Would Meet Their Ends At The Hand Of A Republic Artillery Cannon That Was Aiming At The Same Foundry Maxwell Worked At And Had Recently Arrived At To Hide Away.

And Thus The Film Would End Off With It Showing Raxus Prime Falling Under Imperial Rule And The Destruction Of The C.I.S. Remnant Forces On Other Planets.

Like I Said, This Film Isn't Meant To Convey A Message About The Force, Or Tell A Tale About Ancient Jedi And Sith Fighting A Bloody Battle, It's Meant To Show The Hardships Of Everyday Citizens Living Under The Flag Of The Confederacy Of Independent Systems And Their Fate At The Hands Of The Galactic Empire.

StarWars,"I just wanted to point something out about the clones with how they behave after Order 66. Back in season 5 (I think), when Tip carried out Order 66, notice how he sort of tried to kill Tiplee by slowly walking towards her in the middle of a *battle.* He was under the effects of Order 66 and clearly made no effort to preserve himself despite the obvious risk. Now look at the new episode. In every instance of the clones engaging Ahsoka, they're blindly rushing towards her, regardless of who's in the way. I know blindly carries the connotation of doing something because you don't know any better, but the clones do. Unlike Tup, who was reduced to rambling, the clones in these episode are fully aware of their surroundings and can hold their own in a fight, which makes sense. They're to hunt down any Jedi, no matter the cost, even at their own lives.

Now look at Maul's encounter with the clones. It's clear that they're panicking and are trying to contain him. Hell, some of them even run after being disarmed, both literally and figuratively. They're actively trying to distance themselves from him, yet when Rex, Jesse, and the other clones ambush Ahsoka in the briefing room, they're rushing in there, firing blindly despite the fact that their CO is on the *same end where their blasters are pointed.* I don't know anything when it comes to the military, but I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge that you DON'T point a weapon that can very easily kill people in the general direction of someone important.

Another example was in the last moments of the episode, when they try to storm the medical bay. Again, they're blindly Zerg rushing Ahsoka, despite the fact that they're in a very disadvantageous position.

And yes, I know that maybe it's actually part of their training and that there's a method to their madness, but Tup also showed the same level of suicidal obedience, and that was just one clone. Also, it may also be a possibility that the reason Tup was practically comatose was because his inhibitor chip malfunctioned instead of being properly activated. As a general rule, if a program does something too early, it probably won't do it as well of it was properly run, but that's up for debate and discussion.

Tl:Dr;

I hope you enjoy, those who see this, and I apologize in advance for any tears shed. I was crying while I wrote this. Here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

Dear fandom  
How to say to you?  
Sometime last night  
Fives said his final farewell  
Like a flame that flickers out too soon, he died, he's gone... 

We dedicate every binge-watching to you   
You changed this fandom,   
You helped make the Clones human   
And when you're on screen   
We all cheer for you   
And we never really move on

You had come of age through the Clone Wars  
We cheered and cried for you  
Sometimes that’s all we’d do

You and your brothers built a strong foundation  
And we were there with you  
The way was clear for you  
And you blew us all away (every day)

Every day, every day  
You blew us all away (every day)  
Every day, everyday  
You blew us all away (every day)  
Every day

Ooh  
Every day  
You blew us all away  
Every day",Dear Fives
StarWars,"The first ark comes out and people like it enough, no one seems crazy about it.

The second ark comes out and Reddit seems to question why they even made a 7th season.

The third ark comes out and everyone acts like Filoni is God's gift to entertainment, and asking why we are only getting 12 episodes. 

I love Filoni as much as the next guy, but he has made good episodes of Clone Wars, great episodes of Clone Wars, and bad episodes of Clone Wars. Have we also forgotten he wrote and directed what many believe to be the worst episode of The Mandalorian? Him doing the sequel trilogy would not have made it guaranteed that it was great. 

People complain about the ""kiddy"" aspects of the new trilogy and praise the realism of Rogue One, but want the guy who gave us puffer pigs and space whales to be in charge. 

Ideally I think it would be best if Favreau and Filoni together were the Kevin Feige of Star Wars. With Favreau focusing on everything live action, and Filoni covering the animated projects, as well as the comics and novels. With the 2 of them working together to make everything connect.",This season of the Clone Wars has shown how much of a short term memory the Star Wars fan base has.
StarWars,"I’m a bit confused on to why people keep making youtube videos conplaining and criticizing the new star wars films. When I found out that Disney bought Star Wars back in 2012, I understood that Star Wars as we knew it was over and that the story finished at Return of the Jedi. Whatever we would get after, it could not belong to that story any more for the simple fact that it was not going to be told by George Lucas.

So I never saw these new movies as being part of the “canon”. How could they be if they are being told by Disney? In fact the movies are just a remake of Episodes 4 to 6. They are a story of their own and only take characters from the Lucas Movies as a basis. The naming of episode 7 to 8 is just a marketing strategy but I never bought it. Force Awakens is almost the same story as New Hope. And in both trilogies end the same way: the heroe defeats Palpatine.

I watched these new movies without connecting them to the Lucas movies and I thought the movies were good. Obviously they are made for children and I (I’m 34) onviously find a lot of things in these movies that are silly, but these films were not made for people my age. It’s what Disney does. 

I feel like fans should stop complaining. Lucas decided to sell Star Wars. And from that moment, Disney has the right to do whatever they want with it and its characters...",Why are the Star Wars fans so upset about the sequel trilogy?
StarWars,"Watching it today after the latest Clone Wars and moly mama, the movie honestly is REALLY good. People argue Anakin's turn was too quick but the movie does an EXCELLENT job of showing how out of place and ostracized Anakin felt at every turn. 

He couldn't tell Padme too much about the dreams (His last came true). He couldn't tell The Council or Obi-Wan about Padme or his baby.

When he told Yoda about her upcoming death, he basically said don't worry about it, it's only natural... Don't attach to her, be emotionless. Anakin is all about emotion and at every turn, he was wronged... Every turn except Sheev.

When he was on the council, he was allowed there but wasn't granted the rank of master. This was something NEVER done before and for someone who was supposed to be the chosen one, this felt like a HUGE grievance against him. Mace Windu proudly ostracized and belittled Anakin at every turn then almost killed his only chance to save his wife. 

When he killed the younglings, he probably felt like he was saving them from a life of suffering under the Jedi like he did. Padme and Anakins romance was way better than the AOTC and felt like people who actually cared.... Weird people.

That is all, the movie is actually good and I'd rate it over every single sequel movie. It is the best SW film imo (Empire 2nd). ANH is legendary but Luke is VERY bland in that film, exceptionally so and the film is pretty standard feeling. That's probably blasphemy but it's true. It's a mediocre film that gained a ridiculous amount of traction die to the immense creativity and love behind the universe .",Revenge of the Sith is WAY better than it's given credit
StarWars,"I am going to start off by saying I am not a big fan of the sequels but I appreciate the memories and enjoyment it brought while watching it with my siblings. I also appreciate the great visuals throughout the movies especially the way TLJ was shot. I didn't like the direction the Sequels took regarding Luke's Character but that's a discussion for another time. 

The one thing I really wanted to see explored was the Force was balance and what it really means. They talked a bit about balance in TLJ but didn't seem to explore it in TROS. We see from the prequels and the original trilogy. The Jedis rejection completely of passion and love drove Anakin to the dark side and the eventual demise of the Jedi. We also see that the Sith's complete acceptance of selfishness and indulgent ways can lead to a person with good intentions become corrupt. Both views are extremely polarizing from the Jedi and Sith. I would have hoped to see what balance really meant and Luke's Jedi order be open to all aspects of the force as Palpatine put it. I remember during the marketing of the Sequels they depicted kylo and Snoke as dark side users and not just Sith. I thought that would have been explored but it never was. I think this came from a lack of vision and a cohesive story but wha can you do. 

Do any of you wish these themes were explore the more   deep and thematic aspects of the force?",Exploration of the Force
StarWars,An animated tv show that has characters never even seen in a movie did a better job of making me feel any emotion than anything in the sequels. The characters are far superior. The storytelling is far superior. Dave Filoni is the true successor to George Lucas. Watching these animated characters grow together and then suddenly have to turn on each other against their will was heartbreaking. Seeing Rex tear up when he’s about to shoot Ashoka knowing full well what he was doing was a lot more emotional than watching Rey scream for 3 movies then kill Palpatine in a pretty phoned in way then claim she was a Skywalker. The episode is fantastic. The arc is fantastic. Filoni is outstanding and is truly the best storyteller we’ve gotten since George and it’s not even close.,Season 7 episode 11 of the Clone Wars was far more emotional than anything in the sequel trilogy.
StarWars,"I read somewhere in the Lore of Star Wars that in ancient time, before the use of lightsabers. force users (those who would become jedi) used actual swords and some \[Pacifists\] used a staff. These weapons was entirely imbued with the force.

With this said, could a modern Jedi/Force user have two wooden sticks (For simplicity I'm just gonna call these sticks ""pares"") imbued with the force as his or her weapon. using them like a lightsaber. minus the cutting people and deflecting blaster rounds.

I'm thinking this individual would not kill his/her adversary but instead, disarm him/her and use the force within the pares to knock them unconscious by hitting them in the head. I'm also thinking that s/he could use the pares against blaster rounds but without being able to deflect them back at the one shooting, instead the blaster rounds just dissipates like sparks.",Could a force users saber be a pair of sticks?
StarWars,"This may be an unpopular opinion, based on the previously prevailing views of the prequels, but the politics were one of the good parts of that era. The Prequels were based around the idea of a fall from grace, ostensibly about Darth Vader’s but also about the Republic becoming the Empire.

Compared to the Galactic Civil War and First Order-Resistance War, the Clone Wars felt more like an actual war. Both sides had their reasons for the war, how it happened was explained in detail, and if you get really into it, their were fair points in favor of the Republic and the Confederacy. I see people complain about trade being the cause of the Naboo Crisis in Episode I, but to me that’s one of the most realistic parts of the entire saga. Trade disputes often led to conflict historically, and trade routes to the Outer Rim would definitely be important in the Star Wars galaxy.

The Clone Wars has a subtext of the Human dominated Core vs the alien Periphery, intrigue between political factions as well as Force ideologies. The fact that Leia could follow in the footsteps of both Padmé Amidala and Bail Organa was awesome to me once I saw how they had fought to prevent the Clone Wars and to prevent Palpatine’s growing authoritarianism. 

I enjoyed the sequels, but something I think they lacked, especially with RoS out, was any kind of political motivation for the central conflict. Bloodline did a good job sating some of that thirst, I love the Centrist vs Populist angle, because it evokes that Clone Wars era divide again, but I wish they did more in the films themselves with it. A huge question after Episode IX is “Who controls the galaxy? Is it just anarchy now? Local warlords?”

It might not be everyone’s favorite part of the prequels, but in my view, the politics of the era made it more interesting and enriched the world of Star Wars. I hope future Star Wars content can flesh that out even more.",Politics is what makes the Prequel era interesting
StarWars,"Just got access to Disney+. Watching ep 5 in glorious 4k HDR. Vader's helmet has never shone so brightly, snow speeder scenes are as crisp as anything. 

But so far the real memorable moment is this. In the scene when Leia kisses Luke after arguing with Han, as she pulls away from the kiss, there is a barely visible spit tentacle between the two of them. I'm watching on a 65"" 4K LG C8 OLED but I caught it. Maybe some things are better left in standard definition? Figured I'd share this little discovery as I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else yet.

StarWars,"We all know how Palpatine orchestrated the creation of the Clones from the very beginning to include the inhibitor chips so he could have them turn on the Jedi when the time was right. If he can achieve that level of forced programming with humans, surely it would have been easy to also install something into every Republic Army droid to make them follow Order 66 as well.

But Palpatine isn't concerned about a few Astromech droids. Why would he even bother with such a small thing? And yet those droids saved Ahsoka and Rex and will no doubt be instrumental in their escape in the final episode.

I am the only person who liked Ahsoka at first but now I’ve grown to hate her. 

What originally made Ahsoka so interesting was the fact that she was not seen in the movies making her mortal unlike most other characters. What made her cool was the fact that she adopted traits from obiwan and Anakin she had obiwan’s banter and anakin’s recklessness and hardass bad cop mentality. But mostly her story would always be “You’re a kid and I’m an adult, so I know best, shut up snips” and I was in my teens at the time clone wars came out so I sort of felt for her. But once it became apparent that she is never dying, Anakin and obiwan were gone and she grew up and fully matured all the purpose of this character was gone. 

She leaves the order because they were hypocrites claiming to be good but doing deceitful things, yet she does nothing against the evil. Why did she not help with destroying the Death Star, a planet destroying laser must be okay, I guess? Also, how the hell did, she beat maul, MAUL, c’mon man. Maul was slapping obiwans balls around the whole show. Might I remind you that Obiwan is the guy who defeats the “Chosen One” who is also Darth Vader so how did maul get defeated by a padawan who didn’t even hold a lightsaber for a year (or at least long enough to get a new look). In rebels she defeats people without even using her lightsabers she just thinks and their sabers turn off, pretty ridiculous for someone who hasn’t even finished the standard jedi training. She has devolved into a hypocritical Mary sue. Also, why would Ahsoka sense Anakin’s unspeakable act but Obiwan wouldn’t. 

For my money Anakin should have been forced to watch Ahsoka’s final moments before order 66 this would help his decent into the dark side but also explain why he talks so weirdly and is so possessive of Padme in the movies. Watching your daughter-sister thing die by force lighting would probably fuck you up. Sidious could have killed her in the ‘underneath the jedi temple arc’ and disappear before Anakin could stop him from killing Ahsoka or discover who he is. The story ends with Anakin holding Ahsoka’s lifeless body as the small crack of sunlight surrounding them fades away. 

If they are going to keep her around then she at least needs is a contrast character a “white sith” that does the opposite of Ahsoka. Also, an episode on why does she have an octopus’s butt hole stretched over her head the fat tentacles are gross. I still love the new episodes though",Ahsoka is over-rated

StarWars,"So after my college semester is done I’m planning on watching every single movie and episode (clone wars and rebels) in chronological order listed below (keep reading please!!)

TPM
AOTC
Clone Wars (chronologically)
ROTS
Solo
Rebels
RO
ANH
ESB
ROTJ
Mando
TFA
TLJ
TROS

Now the trouble comes with season 7 of the clone wars and episode 3. I know episodes 9-12 are literally happening at the exact same time as rots, so how should I watch it? Should I watch to the point where anakin and Ashoka separate for the last time then watch rots then go back and finish the episodes? Watch the episodes then the movie? Try to line up the movie and show and play and pause each part?

Maybe I’m thinking too deep on this but I want to hear some feedback.",Important question and I need input
StarWars,"I currently run a Star Wars adaptation for dungeons and dragons fifth edition and it’s likely that my party will be coming across a sith temple in the near future. I’m in the process of making plans for ways of making it difficult to access and traverse the temple, and my main idea for the traversal is to have a series of tests or puzzles each based off of one of the major elements of the sith code, but I’m finding myself at a loss when trying to think of such puzzles, and so I’m reaching out for ideas.",Sith Temple Tests
StarWars,"With the release of the recent Clone Wars episode, many people have begun hating on Mace Windu regarding his seemingly arrogant remarks towards Ahsoka. But, I see that scene, and Mace in an entirely different light following that scene.

Ahsoka is the one to reaffirm her neutrality as a citizen rather than a Jedi, which prefaced his remarks. To Mace, Ahsoka wanted nothing to do with the Jedi, so why would he inform her about their plan to remove the most powerful man in the galaxy from his position? Does Mace seem like a dick, sure, but remember who this man is. Mace Windu is a pragmatic and dedicated individual who has fought a war for three years. He knows the war is coming to a close, and he is faced with the extremely delicate situation of trying to bring peace to a galaxy at war. By telling Ahsoka about their plans, he opens up the possibilities of her attempting to alter them, as she no longer abides by the council or the code. In conclusion, Mace wasn't being an asshole to Ahsoka, he merely wanted to end the war without creating any further complications and if successful, give Ahsoka time to revisit her connection to the Jedi postwar.",In Defense Of Mace
StarWars,"Whenever I see this brought up I cringe internally so hard. It’s like people have completely blotted out what happened with the Franchise and the fan base back in the 2000’s and replaced it with nostalgia glasses. 

After the prequels came out (and especially when TCW movie came out) George Lucas was being burnt on the figurative stake for “ruining Star Wars” until he finally sold the franchise to Disney in 2012. Now in the present day suddenly people are begging for him to come back and “save his vision”? Seriously? The fandom goes round and round in different directions and never knows what it wants. WE, the fans, were the ones who practically forced him out to Disney in the first place guys.

If George Lucas created something on similar quality to the Prequels after hypothetically regaining access to the franchise, it’d be the same story as before, he’d be criticized just as he always has (the recent “MACLUNKEY!” addon to ANH outrage being the biggest example of this) and driven out by us once again. I love the guy and his ideas (they’ve largely inspired my own life) but he’s made some doozies of Star Wars movies and choices in the past. Whether it’s George or Disney at the helm, the result will most likely be the same, the fandom will stay divided. His original idea after all for the overarching narrative of the series was in perspective to the midichlorians (bleh). 

The man does what he wants with the stories he’s made, we’ve seen that with Han shooting second and all the other baffling choices and edits he’s made to all of his entries, it’s clearly not to appease us fans, it’s for him to realize the vision he has of Star Wars. 

Personally, I don’t blame him, it’s his creation, he shouldn’t try to create something he wouldn’t be happy with, he probably honestly believes the changes he made improved the story he made, regardless of the backlash it receives. 

But he can’t “save” Star Wars. That’s up to the new generation of creators. So don’t ask for his return as a messiah figure, because it’s not possible and it wouldn’t ever work out in the end, for us or him.","No, George Lucas could not come and “save” Star Wars today"
StarWars,"So I just got done with a full Star Wars movie marathon. It was fantastic (as you’d expect) but I couldn’t help but feel a little let down. The lore of Star Wars is so complex and so cool, but the prequels felt dry, the originals (though classics and good plots) were a little old, and the sequels (though entertaining movies) could’ve been done in a single movie. So I’m doing what any normal person would do. I’m rewriting the movies. I’ll maintain as many plot points as I can and I plan to leave some portions untouched, but I thought it would be fun to rewrite the entire saga as a fan fiction/ experiment to see if I could make them any better.

One of the main things I’ve been wanting to fix was Anakin’s fall to the dark side. There were a lot of factors that could’ve played into his fall based on the lore. The prequels chose two and sort of half assed it. They went with the power hunger and the padme in danger route. I think there are many other possibilities or improvements.

They could do an inception kind of thing where sidious plants ideas in anakins head until he is consumed by them (sort of the gist they were going for but I think they could make it more convincing.)

They could make Anakin, like sidious, feel that he was better than everyone else and have him confront that but be discovered by sidious.

They could have the Jedi council find out that he was created by sidious and cease all of his training making him hate the Jedi 

They could pull an Ahsoka and have him be framed or somehow shake his faith in the Jedi.

Any of these could work, and likely it would be some small combination. So here’s my question

Which of those do you think sounds the most interesting?",I need your opinion on a rewrite.
StarWars,"The first thing to keep in note is the fact that Rex already knew something about darth sidious because of Ashoka. The moment palpatine popped up, he puts it all together and realizes the whole story.

You can see the small silence palpatine had after issuing the order to Rex, he realized how close he was to failing and saw the anger and realization in Rex’a eyes. He was also probably not expecting to be called darth sidious. He knew there that there were some people who were too close to the truth. (Luckily for him not close enough)

But eventually control took over and Rex became a shell of himself, and then went on to do what you know would happen.",The reason Rex called palpatine “Darth sidious” is actually brilliant.
StarWars,"I would love to see an animated version of revenge of the sith with the new clone wars arc edited into it once the arc finishes. The only difference I would make to any bit of the movie or arc would be to add the line “Save Me” to anakin as he’s burning but wanting obi-wan to save him. Those two words would change the whole dynamic of obi-wan and Vader’s relationship and just elevate it to another level imo. Vader hates obi-wan because he left him to die on mustafar. It would also give us the chance to see more  of the battles on utapau and mustafar. I didn’t feel like we saw a whole bunch of what went on during the mustafar battle due to other things needing screen time. 

I also just want to see the obi-wan battle on utapau and the mustafar battle in CW animation style ngl lol.",How many people would pay to see an animated version of revenge of the sith?
StarWars,"I really don't get it after watching the movie. It feels so weird.   


They have this intricate amazing premise set up of a massive army in waiting along with the original first order and they lost to a few rebels on some animals? Also; shouldn't the massive gathering of sith been able to do something as well? How could they not fight off a small incursion, those were SUPREME STARSHIPS. Like; they were insane. And did the rebellion really kill millions of people that easily? I mean, each one of those ships had to have what, an entire cities worth of people?   


Idk maybe I'm over thinking it; but the end seemed really weird to me.",Can someone explain to me how the First Order even lost?
StarWars,"His name is Darth Torpok and in terms of personality he's a womanising (when it comes to species he's not too fussy) smooth talking combat pragmatist who keeps dangerous animals as pets as they keep him in his feet and is fond of whatever the Star Wars universe's equivalent for cigars are that he usually lights with his lightsaber. He's not as ambitious as other Sith lords as he knows that those who try to rule over whole planets meet with an early grave.

He's accompanied by a cadet in the Sith army called Jicif who he took a liking to when they first met as Jicif made him laugh. Jicif's role is similar to a squire to a medieval knight and since he's not a Sith apprentice trying to kill him there's genuine trust between the two and Jicif is the one person who is allowed to insult Torpok and get away with it (mainly because Torpok simply insults him back). When Jicif falls for the daughter of a general in the Sith army Torpok sends the other rivals for her affection to dangerous battlefields and has those that survive meet with a nasty accident. Torpok is eventually able to secure a reservation for Jicif and the daughter at an excellent restaurant by threatening to kill the owner.

Torpok's story mostly revolves around him often unintentionally helping a lot of people even though his motives are purely in his own interest. His adventures with Jicif include:

* Seducing and sleeping with a ruthless queen which ultimately causes turmoil within her family and ruins her reputation which in turn leads to the ruthless royal family getting overthrown. When leaving he fights and kills the corrupt, power-abusing royal guard as he wants to get some fighting practice done.
* Killing a cruel dictator because he was rude and annoying. Him and Jicif also kills several members of the dictator's secret police because he's in a bad mood and fighting always cheers him up.
* Bringing down a powerful crime lord when another Sith lord bets he can't do it.
* Destroying a giant dangerous out of control prototype war droid before it could destroy a nearby city simply because he was bored and didn't have anything better to do at the moment.
* When him and Jicif crash land on a backwater planet they kill some notorious thieves when they tro to rob them, casually walk into a camp of bandits, sit down at a table and begin eating their food and when some bandits try to stop them Torpok kills them with the force while still eating which gives the other bandits the message not to stop them. When they arrive at a village they're regarded as saviours who are going to help them but they're too tired to object and stay the night. When the village is attacked that night by raiders Torpok kills them simply for disturbing his sleep. A few days later the duo kill some pirates and take their ship but not before Torpok sleeps with a few of the villagers.
* When some jawas are terrorised by a dangerous beast Torpok captures the beast so he can keep it as a pet.

Torpok is aware of how many people he has unintentionally helped and can get annoyed by the gratitude he often receives as he doesn't see himself as a hero but he is willing to exploit his reputation if there is something in it for him (usually either women, alcohol or as I said at the start, the Star Wars equivalent for cigars).

Please let me know what you think and if you have any ideas you can add to Darth Torpok.",My idea for an Old Republic Era Sith Lord
StarWars,"Personally I don’t think they should renew the exclusivity deal with EA but instead allow any studio to pitch their idea for a Star Wars game.

Now I’ll be honest I enjoy battlefront 2 after all the updates and I liked fallen order, however for having the license since 2013 and releasing 2 decent games in 7 years is a bit ridiculous.

EA also thought that this would be a license to print money but that blew up in their face with the lootbox controversy. 

If Disney allowed other publishers to make games alongside EA then we could see a new Star Wars game every year in a range of different genres making some serious cash for Disney.

Hopefully when the time comes Disney consider this option and allow more than just EA to use the Star Wars brand, even with games like maverick and fallen order 2 in apparent development this would not hinder either of those games dev time.",What do you think Disney should do when their contract with EA runs out in 2023?
StarWars,"Everything being set in stone has always kinda put a damper on Star Wars for me. It bleeds into almost every aspect of the series.


New cool Jedi character? Why isn't he helping our protagonist in X movie? There always needs to be a reason written for why these character avoid being in the movies/shows or else it starts to unravel. It creates this feeling of you know what is going to happen to this character as soon as they appear on the screen. They'll either be killed or somehow removed from the spotlight for plot reasons.

Nothing crazy will happen because we know Ashoka is in the Mandalorian and Maul will be in Rebels. Rex will get his chip removed and be in Rebels(and ROTJ I think? I forgot how that panned out).

It would be so refreshing to follow new characters, away from all the predetermined outcomes. It allows for betrayal, death, and uncertainty we cant get in the Skywalker series. 

These are just my thoughts on something thats always bothered me. Im not saying there needs to be the threat of dying for there to be suspense, the latest episode of clone wars proves that, but just uncertainty in general is nice and fun to have every once in awhile.",They need to get away from the Skywalker saga to have a sense of uncertainty in the series for once.

I’ve seen a few s4 episodes, a couple s5 episodes, and then the last 3 episodes of s7. I want to watch all the really good episodes of it before next weeks finale is out. I plan on watching all of s7 before then, but aside from that, what are some essential episodes for me to watch so I can appreciate what’s happening even more? I personally thought the last 3 episodes have been better than even some of the movies (all of the sequels especially), but I want to be able to appreciate them even more.

StarWars,"Whenever I watch star wars videos I see people often say that RotJ was the least good of the original trilogy and most flawed but I really don’t get why. To me personally it’s probably my favorite of the originals with Empire being really close. Honestly ANH is my least favorite of the originals. I just feel RotJ was much more emotional and impactful than ANH which makes sense since it’s the third movie. Luke just felt a lot more interesting and showed how far he has come from that plucky young adventurer in ANH. We see him go into some morally questionable actions specifically the force choking the guards at Jabba’s palace and how he has kind of turned on his masters for lying to him which was leading him down a darker path. The theme of it was essentially like Anakin in RotS is essentially the road to hell is paved with good intentions that being to save his father. Not to mention his interactions with Vader was amazing

The biggest issues I hear people bring about it are that it refuses the Death Star, the Ewoks (though this has died out) and the plan to save Han was kind of stupid. Eh i understand these complaints but to me the positives vastly outweigh the negatives and feel the criticisms just don’t weigh down the best parts which to me are some of the best parts in the entire OT (Luke and Vader interactions, their fight, the Emperor, Jabba’s palace and barge etc)",Why do people say RotJ is the least good of the original trilogy?
StarWars,"So I just played the two games for the first time since they came out using PS Now and I have some... statements. Now I’ve heard that the story in the first one is really good but I was pretty let down. I like the premise a lot but I don’t really see the turn in the characters. Like one minute they go from the empire to the next moment they’re good. I get the whole “go form the rebellion thing” (even though that’s pretty dumb in of itself) but I didn’t get the feeling of StarKiller ever really having a gradual move to the light side. Just kinda felt like an immediate switch. 

Now the gameplay in the first game was incredible. I loved the saber duels at the end of levels and really felt powerful cutting my way through troops. 

The second game however was the biggest disappointment I’ve had in a while. I was shocked by the dismemberment which was great but the game felt either incredibly easy or incredibly frustrating at times. There were no saber boss fights besides Vader’s lame one at the end which was just throw these things back at me then fight my minions repeat x5. 

The story also managed to be even worse than the original. What little there was to the characters was completely gone now and all that was left was “much gotta save Juno” despite of the whole point of the ending to the first game was sacrificing himself for the rebellion. 

Basically if you are looking at playing these games either for the first time or the first time in a while (on PC, PS Now, and Xbox backwards compatibility), end it on the first one. As a bonus the first game has some really excellent dark side ending dlc.",Force Unleashed.
StarWars,"What if the movie started with Rey been captured by snoke (basically it starts on the third act, but a lot changes, like instead of being right after ep 7 it takes place like 1 or 2 years later.

Rey has been training with Luke but after a distress call by the resistance Rey chooses to help the resistance but she's captured by the first order on her way.
Cut to a torn Kylo perhaps haunted by anakins force ghost or nightmares of Han's death has lead him to kill snoke (leading to the throne fight but this time it's at the beggining) after the fight everything on crait happens but no Luke, instead it's a chase, and the resistance barely escapes from the first order.",Alternate start for episode 8 and essentially the whole film
StarWars,"Without Fives it's reasonable to assume Ahsoka isn't able to turn Rex and does not escape. We will learn more next episode, so this may all be wrong if it looks like she could have escaped without Rex. But if we assume she gets killed if Rex does not turn then she never helps the Rebellion. Without Ahsoka Vader gets the Holocron. Without Ahsoka who knows what happens with the rebellion as she was incredibly valuable to them. The only Jedi Fives was able to save may have been the reason the rebellion survived. I know it's far from a guarantee, but I don't think its improbable to assume Ahsoka dies without his hologram warning and without Ahsoka the rebellion dies. Did Fives's sacrifice end up toppling the Empire?",Fives did NOT die in vain. In fact he saved the galaxy
StarWars,"Since I saw Star Wars for the first time when I was 5 years old, I’ve been in love. I’ve been a fan, own all the movies, grew up with posters on my wall, toys, a bed set, clothes, Darth Vader masks and toy lightsabers. In the 15 years since I saw it for the first time my love has never died. 

On the internet though, sharing your opinions with other fans is terrible. Star Wars elitists are the most obnoxious people on earth. On any post someone makes about the newer 3 films, you have bombardment of people saying “those aren’t canon. you shouldn’t watch this because it isn’t canon. star wars sucks because it has girls who are strong and aren’t chained up in their underwear next to a slug” 

It really is annoying to constantly see elitism and gatekeeping in this fandom. Disney makes a post on instagram saying you can soon watch all 9 movies on their platform, and what is the comment section filled with? “why would i wanna watch the last three?” “the last three arent canon” “i’ll only be watching the first six since they don’t have rey” “the original trilogy is the only one you should watch” and all of these comments have thousands or hundreds of likes. we get it. YOU don’t like it. YOU aren’t the decider for everyone else. 

It is a think in this fandom and many others that turn away new members from joining because they’ve only seen the newer three and when they say it it’s like their opinion is invalidated because they don’t agree with them. I seriously hate this fandom, i’ve never been able to attach myself to it because it is filled with elitism and “oh you don’t know who this guy is because you didn’t read issue number 6 of this comic telling an obsolete storyline for the expanded universe, fake fan” 

All in all I love star wars but this fandom keeps me away from making friends because most are rude. I like all 9 films, and the amount of times i’ve been belittled or reacted to as lesser than because i like something out of the norm is astounding. i really hope it changes and people can see that everyone has different opinions. if it isn’t canon, who cares. is the expanded universe not considered non canon too, yet everyone loves it. I agree the new movies have lots of flaws, but it’s more on story telling than on having a female leader or a female lead.",This fan base is really atrocious.
StarWars,"I have not started the final season of Clone Wars yet, I'm waiting for the season to be complete before I start so i can binge so please no spoilers in the comments. I have the Ahsoka novel and Son of Dathomir comic series on my reading lists, and was also waiting until clone wars was finished before I dove into those. Having said all of that, would i need to do all 3? Based on whats happened so far in season 7, how much new info would I gain from the novel or comics? I would probably read Son of Dathomir either way because I like how easy to digest comics are and the art style but should i/do i need to read Ahsoka too in order to get the full picture? Also, am I saving everything in the right order, should I read the novel/comics before watching season 7? Help me r/StarWars, you're my only hope!


Tl;Dr waiting to start CW season 7 until its over to binge, once I watch season 7 do I still need to read Ahsoka novel and Son of Dathomir comics????",Clone Wars final season vs Ahsoka vs Som Of Dathomir (No Spoilers)
StarWars,"Obvious hyperbole, I don't actually think these are the biggest mistakes of star wars, but it's a progression of two things I noticed that just kind of bother me about how certain characters are handled throughout canon.

The two main examples of this are Boba Fett and Darth Maul.

It's no surprise that at a glance, both villains are ultimate badasses... Excellent visual story-telling and lots of intrigue associated with them. They are silent, but always shown being very observant - basically waiting for their master to sic them on one of the heroes with a ""you'll get your turn"" sort of look to them.

But oh my god were these villains handled poorly in the movies. To the point that these are some of the biggest let-downs in the entire series. Boba Fett getting hit in the back by a blinded Han Solo causing him to smack into the side of Jabba's sail barge and fall into the Pit of Carkoon. All in a matter of like 10 seconds. Maul dies in a cooler way and leads to a pretty emotional scene after he kills Qui Gon in front of young Obi-Wan Kenobi only to be killed off seconds later, denying what could have been a spanning nemesis for Obi-Wan throughout the series.

Now, I know what you're about to say, so before you say it: yes both Boba Fett and Maul actually survive these encounters. But not really. It's incredibly obvious that they were killed in these scenes and everything after like Darth Maul in Clone Wars and Rebels is just trying to correct the mistake of off-ing them in the first place.

But anyways, this leads me to what I think is the second biggest mistake in all of star wars: too much of a good thing.

After realizing that characters like Boba Fett and Darth Maul were popular with fans and going: ""oh.. maybe we shouldn't have killed them off so fast, let's bring them back"" they double down and show wayyyy too much of both of them. 

With Maul making tons of appearances in Clone Wars and Rebels having a personal battle with Ahsoka, appearing in Solo as what seems to be a level above the main villain of the movie... I think it's undoing the exact thing that made him great: the mystery. Same with Boba Fett, though its mostly just ruining the mystique of the Mandalorians as a whole... we're told they are these rare and mysterious warriors, but it feels like every other character introduced is a fucking Mandalorian: like *the* Mandalorian (Mando i.e. Dyn Djarin), Sabine Wren, the whole Mandalore plotline in Clone Wars.

So at the end of the day. I think it's good that they are receiving more fulfilling conclusions than the movies provided, but in the process, I think how some have handled it have ruined the entirety of what made them great. That being said, these are just my opinions. I'm not trying to attack yours, so if you disagree, I'm perfectly fine with that.

TL;DR: its one thing when a cool and mysterious villain is handled poorly like Boba Fett and Maul, but then it gets worse when what's left that makes them great (being cool and mysterious) is ruined by being overused.",One of the biggest mistakes in star wars followed by the second biggest mistake
StarWars,"I got this idea after watching the new episode today

What if there was a first person shooter game set in the Clone Wars where you play as a Clone Commander. You start out on the battle of Geonosis. Eventually you're assigned to a Jedi general. The Jedi would be an original character. You grow to love your Jedi general. Eventually you're in phase two armor. You fight a battle on this planet then that planet then in the middle of some mission on some planet you get a message from the Chancellor. Now all of a sudden you have to hunt down this Jedi General that you grow to love over the game. Itd be like the original BF2 campaign but with original characters and you have no idea when 66 is coming. Theres no clues besides maybe some subtle hints. But the game is meant to be played from the clones' perspective where it just happens out of nowhere and you are compelled to obey it.",Idea for a Star Wars game
StarWars,I just feel like there could be so much interesting backstory provided to add context which furthers emotional stakes that weren’t really there in the films. Seeing Ahsoka just sensing Anakins turn was absolutely brilliant. Even with only a voiceover I was devastated. Some possible storylines for the Sequel wars could be kylos training or Finn doing something useful like his friendship developing with Poe while gaining victories for their side. Would love to hear some more possible ideas in the comments.,Someone should make a Clone Wars style show set during the Sequel Trilogy
StarWars,"Mace is HORRIBLE. 

He is constantly rude and dismissive to Aniken though he knows he is the chosen one, only because he believes he was allowed into the order though Mace votes against it. Sure he says Aniken struggles with anger and confusion but we have seen so many Jedi deal with that too. He is just bitter he didn’t get his way. By extension he treats Ahsoka like shit too.

He is also a full warmonger. He has no interest in the peaceful route. Rather than take Jango in for questioning like the council had asked Obi Wan to do, Mace just straight beheads him. He even tells Boba later to just get over it. He has no compassion which is one of the basics of the order.

His entire life revolves around the stringent Jedi code and rules of the temple. He is essentially a Zealot who rejects any who do not follow his own path. I can think of so many other reasons he is a horrible Jedi. Everything about him is what is wrong with the Jedi order and allowed Sidious to rise. I think that makes him an interesting character but a terrible Jedi. I always see people talking about how he is their fav Jedi and I have to assume it’s because he has a fan favorite actor and a cool lightsaber colour because for the life of my I don’t know why else.",Mace Windu is one of the worst Jedi we have ever seen and people only like him because of his purple lightsaber.
StarWars,"Hey everyone so I’m showing my gf the ENTIRE Star Wars saga from beginning to end starting with episode 1 - 9 with EVERYTHING in between that is important, with that being said we’ve watched episode 1 and 2 and before 3 I want to watch a few episodes of the clone wars, can someone give me a link or their advice of the important episodes without the fillers that to her would be pointless, I for one have watched season 1-6 twice and currently on season 7 but I know watching 120 some odd episodes could be tiresome for someone who isn’t as much of a fan as us so any advice would be great 😁",Clone wars order?
StarWars,"star wars has literally always had strong, empowering and inspiring females. Right from 1977 we had Leia and Mon Mothma, both super independent women who inspire others. They all have wonderful arcs. In the prequels, we obviously have Ahsoka (have you ever heard anyone say I don't like Ahsoka) who we grew with, her story, her arcs, her character all brilliant, that's why she is one of the most loved characters in star wars to date. Then there's Padme, a woman who's independent, can fight for herself and most importantly fights for what is right. We have so many string Jedi, aayla secura, aadi galya, luminara unduli, bariss offee. If you want badass women who rule over others, we have asajj ventress (her arc is one the best), aurra sing, bo katan. There are so many leaders, padme, satine, tu chi. Then we have Sabine wren later. Women have always been there in star wars and the fans have never been against it. Kathleen Kennedy wanted another woman character, yes we need more of course. But due to her sheer lack of creativity, stubbornness to look into older stories and hunger for control (there's this quote in clone wars, ""one who seeks control, shall never find peace."") she created this ""perfect"" Disney princess who had no flaws and was extremely bland. No one can relate to someone like that, therefore the backlash. Rey has no plot or personally and overall I think she has done the worse for the future of women. The prequels did have real world politics, but it was part of the plot. Here the plot is part of the politics...",The women backlash from the point of view of a woman
StarWars,"Look, high republic could be total garbage, but people are stating it like it’s a fact right now. I’m going to wait till I read some of its content before making that decision. I wonder if any of them have even read a canon novel/comic. Cause every complaint is comparing it to the sequel trilogy. These are completely different departments with different people. Fallen Order had its own crew, Mandalorian had its own crew. The haters also say they should have just done the old republic, but I feel like they would still complain saying they are ruining it or should do something new. The rest of the haters are just yelling sjw. Look, I hate sjws just as much as the next guy, but the only thing that annoys me as much as sjws, are anti sjws. If the high republic ends up being a let down, I’ll be the first to admit it. But I have faith because out of all the new canon novels, there were only three I didn’t like. Pretty good track record.",Why are people trashing High Republic before it’s even out?
StarWars,"(Originally posted on r/PrequelMemes)

There's some amazing continuity in filmmaking going on in Clone Wars s7 e11.

In the original hologram conference in ROTS, the scene ends with a symmetrical horizontal wipe cut over Yoda's face (01:01:53). 

*Processing video nug8pujas6w41...*

In this episode, the scene continues and immediately Ahsoka enters (00:02:57). The transition is marked by an in-frame effect very similar to the wipe cut. Behind Mace Windu's face, you can see the doors opening in a horizontal motion which reverses the wipe cut from ROTS.

The wipe cut in ROTS reveals Palpatine; the doors in this episode reveal Ahsoka.

StarWars,"Show us his birth and training on Kamino, and how he got his name and how he rose through the ranks to become Captain. 

Show us his POV throughout the Clone Wars, and how the war changed him and his comrades. 

Show us how he found Wolfe and Gregor after Order 66, and how he removed their inhibitor chips, and what they did after going into hiding. 

Show us his perspective during Rebels, and what he did after he joined the Rebel Alliance. I don’t know how feasible this is, but I think it’d be cool for him and Wolfe to find out if any other clones disobeyed Order 66. 

Show us him watching Luke’s medal after “A New Hope”, and he hears someone mention his name is Skywalker. Have him meet Luke later, and have him talk about Anakin and Ahsoka and his experiences during the Clone Wars. These stories would only strengthen Luke’s faith in his father, and Rex playing a small part in Anakin’s redemption would be absolutely perfect. 

Show us him during different campaigns between “A New Hope” and “Return of the Jedi”. 

Show us his perspective during the battle of Endor, and watching the destruction of the second Death Star. Have him attend Anakin’s funeral with Luke, and they’d reminisce about their experiences. 

Show us him being rewarded with retirement, and have him watch as Luke and Ahsoka build the new Jedi Order.",You know what I’d like after season 7 of The Clone Wars is finished? A comic book arc that examines the complete life of Captain Rex.

After Ben has his conversation with Han, throws his lightsaber into the water, and is fully embracing the light side, it would have been neat for him to turn around and Anakin be there finally revealing himself to his grandson. He doesn’t say anything, but points back towards the Death Star throne room remains. Ben finds a pile of wreckage in the throne room and in it is Darth Vader’s lightsaber. Ben picks up the hilt and Anakin appears in front of him and says “You under estimate YOUR power”.

StarWars,"It seems very odd considering from gameplay they have the same power scaling. The strongest enemy  outside of bosses either encounter are ATSTs and both display the same power to destroy them. I think the part where people overhype Starkiller is the famous Star Destroyer scene and him beating Vader despite both of these working extremely well within the Star Wars universe.

Starkiller has many huge things working for him that has given him his crazy force powers as a child and that's the fact that he was born from two Jedi lovers who left the Order to be together to raise their child. Just look at how powerful the Skywalker twins are from being born of Anakin, The Shan family from being born of Revan and Bastila or Rey's strength from being born of Palpatine, someone born of two masters will obviously have high force powers. Starkiller also spent 10 years being subjected to the most brutal training Vader could think up, and giving him the most pure and unfiltered Sith training probably ever done due to how the rule of two works. There are alot of lore represented reasons as to why he was so powerful, Cal is powerful because of his OP PLS NERF ability to literally take not only force power but skills from objects with strong force connections to them. To give you an example of stupid op that, if Cal touches the Skywalker lightsaber he gains all of Anakin's skills at the height of the Clone Wars, instantly mastering all forms of lightsaber combat and likely absorbing a large chunk of the force within the weapon. That's OP, that power has no cap, so if he does the same with anything such as sniffing Palpatine's robes, he'll get he same affect. If Cal were to ever just go to The Valley of the Sith Lords and JUST TOUCH SHIT, he'd become a god. How do people not see that as OP but think Rey or Starkiller is? That isn't a trained ability that is just something he has a birth, he just got an insane dice roll and is living it up. What reason does Cal even have to run form Darth Vader when all he has to do is touch his lightsaber once and know everything in his bag of tricks. He's absurdly op and yet this is fine to people but not Starkiller. BTW I want to point to that Vader has an insane power scaling moment in Fallen order, he uses the force to hold back an entire ocean, that's power and also works within the Star Wars lore.

Okay so let's talk about Star Killers feats. As I said before he and Cal both show the ability to destroy AT ST, and they both know how to fight powerful force users. To address the Star Destroyer scene all I have to do is point you to Yoda. As Yoda makes it very clear, size doesn't many anything to the force, if you have the will to do, then you will unless you're being acted upon by another. Even if you refuse to accept the words of the Grand Jedi Master then the simple fact that he didn't bring down the Star Destroyer should suffice because the Star Destroyer was already going down, he just made it go down faster and prevented it from crushing him...mostly. If you have an issue with him bringing down a Star Destroyer, saying that's impossible then take that shit up with Luke Skywalker who during the battle of Jakku was destroying ENTIRE FLEETS with the force. Slamming Star Destroyers into each like he was  making a giant metal imperial sandwich. It's well within lore and even so preached by the grand master that this power is well within the force to be done. Well how did he defeat Vader, simple lightning. Vader's suit is specifically designed by Palpatine to be weak to lightning in the old lore and Starkiller specializes in force lightning so much that he invented his own ability called Lightning Shield. Now tell me, what the mynock ass is Vader going to do against an ability called lightning shield? Die, he's going to die. On top of that Vader was significantly weaker then Anakin, it wasn't until the retcon did Disney actually make him more powerful then Anakin. While I dislike this change it is a lore reason that people forget as to why Vader isn't pulling off the same feats as Anakin.

I understand the idea that Starkiller is OP but if you think he's too strong then you have to atleast acknowledge that Cal has the ability to insanely powerful scale. While Starkiller was nothing short of a force giant Cal could easily surpass Luke in his might given enough time. Not because he's better trained, but simply because when he rolled a D20 he landed on 36.",I find it weird that people think Starkiller is OP but think Cal Kestis is totally fine.
StarWars," Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it. When the episode ended my first thought was: is that all? Sure, we got to see order 66 from Ahsoka's and Rex's perspective, but I think this episode could have been much more. I wanted to see more Maul instead of just one Rogue One Vader hall scene and something to happen that we don't know already. We only have one episode left, so I expected much more action. Now I hope the last episode will be a bit longer with more action.

I'll probably get downvoted for this but this is what I think. Or it might be just because I watched it after episode 10 that is in my opinion the greatest episode in the entire show.",Opinion on episode 11 TCW (SPOILERS)

Ben Solo was an edge Lord of the sequel trilogy, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the plot to create a cliché ending… He had such a knowledge of the script that he could even change Rey's parentage between movies. ""The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" said Palpatine in his only memorable line in episode 9. He had so much plot armour… the only thing he could do was give up his life energy to satisfy Reylo shippers. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",A tragedy indeed.
StarWars,"TLDR: This is some good ass television my god

I've been a fan of Star Wars since around the period leading up to the release of the Force Awakens, when my Dad introduced me to the original trilogy so that I'd be all caught up. Safe to say I loved them all and loved the movie when it came out, but I'll try to leave my opinions on the sequels out of this. Point is Star Wars has not always been a part of my life like so many other fans, and I'm still relatively new to the universe even 5 years later.

My Dad on the other hand has been a huge fan all his life after watching Star Wars in cinema back in '77, and is in the large majority of older fans who despised most of what the prequels were. Skip forward to this February when the new season of Clone Wars is released and I decide to watch the first 'Bad Batch' episode despite having only seen a few episodes prior when the show was still on Netflix. I was in love, and to my surprise so was my Dad.

Since then I've been watching every single episode in chronological order, and I have almost nothing but praise for this fantastic show. Everyone seems to feel Season 1 is the weakest and while I found this to be the case, I still really enjoyed arcs like Ryloth and even the Malevolence episodes. It's been a blast watching the show grow and develop in both maturity and technical quality - having just finished Umbara my mind was blown at how far this show has come. Even Dad has occasionally watched episodes, and despite his bizarre disdain for Obi-Wan he was been really enjoying the world building and connections to the OT (Tarkin in Season 3 was a big hit). I find this interesting above all because we both found Rebels far too whimsical in tone to be taken seriously, a shame given it set in my personal favourite era of a galaxy far, far away. Compare this to the brutal, sometimes devastating plotlines in TCW and it's a breath of fresh air.

If you've read this far, thank you. I've just had a lot of praise for this show for a little while now and wanted to get it out in a community that I hope will appreciate it. As I said, I've only just finished the Umbara arc (mid season 4) so please no spoilers if you want to reply. Can't wait for all the good that is too come!

StarWars,"In The Rise of Skywalker we see Rey apparently defeat the last Sith (palps) and the thousands of Sith before him, but what does Rey do after this? Will she go on to create a new Jedi order and possibly recruit kids like the one in The Last Jedi? If this happens won’t the Sith/Dark side just rise again to balance the force and thus resume the fighting? The only way to possibly stop this inevitable fight is for Rey to cut herself off from the force and let the Jedi die as well and let the force die in the galaxy which I don’t see her doing.

StarWars,"Why the hell would he just assume that? The only reason Mace Windu was going to execute Palpatine was because he was a Sith Lord. And in that moment, Mace Windu decided to execute him on his own. There's no way a Jedi like Yoda, or most other Jedi, would make that call. The only evidence remotely close to making the argument they would kill the senators is when the Jedi talk about MAYBE taking control of the Republic until they figure things out. But even Yoda doesn't really agree that that's the way it should go down. I just don't get why he would assume that the Jedi would go around massacring a bunch of politicians. Also, does Anakin not realize that Palpatine literally constructed the whole war? Sidious even tells him where the Separatists are and the Separatists tell Anakin that Sidious told them he was coming. Orchestrating an entire war seems like a very evil thing to do. So why can't Anakin see Sidious and the Sith really are evil?",Why would Anakin believe the Jedi were about the kill all the senators?
StarWars,"Yeah, this sounds childish. I have a really bad viewpoint on drugs, and you cannot blame me for it as I have seen the most healthy become destroyed by them. It even created a fear of them for me. For example, I thought that if I had an idol that suddenly used drugs, I would start to dislike them and forget them. I’ve always loved Star Wars, it’s been a thing I can connect to and just enjoy by playing games, watching the films, listening to the music.. Carrie’s death of course saddened me when I heard it in 2016. I read that it was because of a heart problem, but recently found out that Carrie using drugs sometimes as a method of calming down and use it as an escape. At first I was kinda shocked, but so many actors have recovered from that so it is not the biggest surprise, but it did sadden me, but oh well, it happened. I’ve always disliked drug addicts. But today that viewpoint has changed, I’d rather support them these days as usually it’s something that turns into a bad habit and destroys health. Don’t get me wrong, it sucks to see drug addicts, but now I actually sympathize with them being victims of it. Carrie did go into rehab but relapsed. At one point she was living a ‘normal life’. She was also diagnosed as bipolar. I never took and never will take drugs, I’ve seen how it’s killed off people. But I can relate to Carrie in the bipolar sense. I was hit with mental health issues a couple of years ago and it was a long road to happiness. When I read that she took drugs I wanted to stop liking Star Wars. It sounds stupid, but then I realized she was just of many unfortunate victims. Carrie’s parents got divorced when she was 17, and she had just a couple of years later risen into stardom. I think to deal with all that pressure she used those drugs. 
Despite Carrie dying in an unfortunate way, she was an inspiration to many, and all of this made me realize the contrary of  hat I thought I would say after reading this: that she was a true icon and I gained a lot more respect to her after reading all of this.","After finding out that Carrie struggled with Bipolar Disorder and Addiction, I gained ever more respect towards her."

-The OT spawned additional content like no other. Books, games, comics, toys, you name it 

-The Prequels were flawed, but the storyline gave us spin-offs like the Clone wars and memorable characters like Ashoka, Maul, Rex and a fleshed out Anakin and Obi-Wan. Tons of toys and costumes sold.

The sequels...too early to tell. My biased opinion is that we won’t see that much content. World-building was missing, story incoherent and weak, and the characters were not so memorable or interesting besides Kylo (deceased) Who will dress up as Rey or Finn 3 years from now? Who will buy Rose toys? (Not counting Palpatine as he was established and brought back for $$$)

What say you? Will the sequels spawn content in the future like the previous trilogies? Or will SW just move to the Old republic and the mandalorian, as well as keeping up the Prequel/OT, while the sequels fade away?","Will the sequels spawn content, or will they be forgettable?"
StarWars,"Please don't judge me for this but ...
I never saw Star Wars til recently. I tried to get through it a few years ago and fell asleep. Finally tried it again and got through all the movies (except the new one and side ones) and I'm almost fully caught up on clone wars now. Wasn't looking forward to watching clone wars, but my boyfriend convinced me, and that sold me on ALL of it. We're watching Rebels next. But I know there's a ton of books and comics out there. I was wondering which ones would be a good place to start and especially which ones are Canon?

Trust me. I've seen the error of my ways. I adore Star Wars. R2D2 is my favorite. And Rex from CW is my baby. So please don't judge me lol. Just looking for recommendations from all the true fans out there. Thanks in advance! 😊",What books out there are Canon?
StarWars,"Characters like Darth Vader and Chewbacca were easy to collect because there was only one version of them. Others like Luke, Han, and Leia were harder to collect, because of all of the different versions of them. My mom wouldn't let me have different versions of the same character, and I wasn't fond of the idea, either, so I had to decide on which version I wanted, and I always had a hard time deciding. 

Did I want Tatooine Luke, Pilot Luke, Dagobah Luke, or full Jedi Luke? It drove me nuts. Did anybody else have this issue?",A problem I had with collecting Star Wars action figures as a kid
StarWars,"I think this most recent episode solidified Ahsoka as the future face of Star Wars. It’s becoming pretty obvious that future SW content won’t be playing into the sequel trilogy characters. I think The Mandalorian and it’s main cast are going to be more prominently displayed in the canon. I’ve been asking myself this over and over since The Rise of Skywalker. What’s next? 

I think the best choice would be to have Djarin, baby Yoda, and Ahsoka spearhead the franchise from here. I think Disney will try and start a cinematic universe from this, much like the marvel one. And this will most likely be the start of it. We already have content being bridged over different Star Wars eras through Ahsoka. She brings the knowledge of both the failures of the Jedi order, as well as the wisdom from a lifetime of tragedy. If she could I part this knowledge on baby Yoda, then this franchise has a future story built up already. 

Of course this is all rampant speculation. But I think the groundwork for a cinematic universe surrounding Ahsoka, Djarin, and Baby Yoda is already there.",The new face of Star Wars
StarWars,"Already seeing discussion of the line in Rebels where Rex says he didn’t betray his Jedi is now false or referring to Anakin, I don’t think so.

The line still refers to Ahsoka, for one he wasn’t with Anakin so it’s not an active choice not attacking him &amp; second Anakin was exempt from Order 66.  

Rex definitely considers Ahsoka his Jedi too, he fought Order 66 and didn’t purposely choose to fire on her. When he was given his free will back he made a choice to protect her and not betray her, fighting his own brothers to save her life. It still fits, if a little messy. 

We will see this further in the next episode.",TCW S7E11 SPOILER - The line from Rebels still makes sense
StarWars,"After a tume of thinking about this I just want more... and I know I shouldn't because this is tue end of Clone Wars. It must end in a cohesive beautiful way that is according to the creators, not the company or it's fans.

But just. It's not fair! They're holding us back! There should have already been many more seasons. The initial vision for the series is already lost, while only the finaly is alowed to exist.

They were already working on Season 7 before they were canceled, right? Some of the season is out on youtube for the public to see (despite not being complete). This highly suggests that Season 6 was completed but simply not aired. Well. I say fuck it why not release that footage if it exists? Why let it sit and collect dust only to be ""discovered"" a hundred years from now by some archeologist? I'm not sure if it is a twitter thing or a Snapgram thing but here goes: #releaseseason6!",I think the rest of CW season 6 should be aloud to air

A tall, black cloaked, sword wielding villain? Check.  
Ewoks? Well no. But a troupe of valiant acrobatic dwarfs? Check.  
Jedi mind tricks? Hoo boy check.  

Ok, it's a bit of a stretch I admit. Certainly not an overt inspiration. But anyone with a love for Star Wars will certainly notice the Darth Vader helmet haircut on the advisor in the king's court, and Luke's Tattooine outfit during the climactic lightsaber... er sword fight scene.  
Whatever the case, an excellent movie for Star Wars fans to look for references in.","I recently watched the 1955 movie/musical ""The Court Jester"" starring Danny Kaye, and saw Star Wars all over it."
StarWars,"Hey Y'all.   So I just got into Star Wars,  as a kid I had seen the movies but didnt get into the lore or really sit down in watch the movies (I watched mostly for the action).    Anyways with quarantine being a thing I've wanted to get into the star wars universe.   To keep things simple I wanted to watch, and read, everything considered ""Canon"" by disney or current Lucasfilm.    I want to read and watch it chronologically including the TV shows.      Does anybody have a list to follow that hits all the points?     I would like to stick to base story stuff before venturing into the EU.

Thanks!",How to: Starwars
StarWars,"With the new episode of Clone Wars I got to thinking and Rex really went through the worst trauma during order 66.

Obi-Wan watched all of his friends die and someone that was like a brother to him turn to darkness.

Yoda was forced to live with the fact that he let down the Jedi and felt that he was the reason for all this.

While these two are often thought of the people who suffered most during order 66, Rex went through so much more. After watching countless brothers fall during the war, now he realizes it was all for nothing. After this, he turns on one of the people he’s closest to and tries to fight it as best he can, but still ends up trying to kill her. Finally, he’s forced to kill his own brothers, who are helpless in this situation. Rex has been through so much trauma in about an hour it’s awful.",Rex suffered more than anyone else from the events of order 66.
StarWars,"The Mandalorian is complete garbage because it removes the feeling of mystery from Yoda during the original trilogy and the prequels. In the prequels I know Yaddle existed but she was not shown much which still made yoda feel special but now baby yoda is ruining what George Lucas intended to do to make yoda special. Also all the people who treat baby yoda like the second coming of Jesus Christ need to shut up he just a ploy to make Disney a lot of money. Also the Porgs suck too and were made to make merchandise that makes Disney money.
Now roast me in the comments:)",The Mandalorian is garbage
StarWars,"We know Ahsoka survived through the end of the Galactic Civil War and then joined Sabine to search for Ezra.     
My crazy fantasy theory is that Ahsoka somehow met up with Luke in between ESB &amp; ROTJ and helped enhance Luke’s Jedi training, perhaps even showing him how to build his own lightsaber.    
She also could not go with Luke to confront Vader &amp; the Emperor, because she tells him “the last time I confronted your father, I hesitated, and it almost cost me my life. I know that my old master is still in there, deep down, but will take a Jedi to bring him back. I am no Jedi.”      
Once Luke almost kills Vader but refuses to strike him down, Palpatine does his thing with the force lightning. While Vader is just standing there watching the Emperor kill Luke, he hears the faintest of voices in his head, it’s Ahsoka,      
re-connecting to her old master through The Force. She pleads with Anakin to save his son, to return to the hero, the good man that she once knew. This telepathic pleading finally gets through to Anakin, and it serves as a tipping point to snap him out of his Dark Side trance, to realize what is happening right before his eyes.",Headcanon: Ahsoka is the reason Anakin returned and saved Luke from Palpatine
StarWars,"When I started watching the clone wars, I simply didn't care about Ahsoka. I didn't, hate her like alot of people did, she was just, fine.

As the show progressed and, her writing and development continued, I like knew she grew into a good, likable character who's very, very well written... but she just didn't click with me. When she had co episodes with Anakin, I was ready for Anakin to be back on screen. When she had episodes with Rex, I was more drawn to Rex. 

By the time she was expelled from the order, I did, ""LIKE"" her, and I really wanted to love her. I knew how popular she was, and how amazingly written and acted, but, I just didn't really love her at all. Then, S7x09 released. And, seeing her reunite with Anakin made me tear up. I don't know what changed, but I absolutely love Ahsoka now. It's just, insane how well done this ""kids cartoon"" is. Its just fucking awesome",My Opinion On Ahsoka
StarWars,"I'm sure this has been discussed before but after all these years Anakin's last moments as a Jedi still don't make sense to me. He wants Palpatine alive to save Padme, so he cuts off Mace's hand to save Palps. Then Palps kills Mace and Anakin is apparently overwhelmed with guilt. I know he's desperate at that point but the next viable step is pledging himself to Palpatine? And immediately setting off to murder hundreds of younglings? This makes absolutely no sense. He knows that he'd lose Padme forever by doing this, even if he manages to prevent her foreshadowed death. It is also out of character. In the clone wars and episodes 1 and 2 Anakin is portrayed as impetuous and capable of killing in righteous rage (sand people) but also intelligent, dignified, caring and loyal to his friends. It doesn't make sense for Anakin to be so utterly stupid and chose to be a cold blooded killer. What he should have attempted to do is  defeat Palapatine, take him prisoner as he originally wanted to, and then coerce him into revealing Plaguis's secret to saving people from death. I think this was just bad writing by George Lucas. Unfortunately this is what we are stuck with. Anakin's fall to the dark side deserved a better story.",I still don't understand Anakin's actions
StarWars,"So I was looking at some old Reddit threads and noticed several people complain that The Phantom Menace cut a majority of Darth Maul's dialogue. Now, I personally am fine with his character lacking dialogue in the final film because it added mysteriousness to the Sith and created an interesting duality with Palpatine (Palpatine was the brain, Maul was the brawn). However, what was George Lucas's reasoning for cutting Maul's dialogue? I can't find any interviews where he discusses this &amp; most of the old threads just used this as fuel to trash George rather than delve into his reasons for this decision.",Why was Darth Maul's dialogue cut from Episode 1?
StarWars,"I’ve been rewatching the entire TCW series front to back in anticipation for the new episode tomorrow, and I came up with a theory of how Ahsoka and Rex survived Order 66 - she wasn’t designated a Jedi. 

Let me explain: at the end of Season 5, Ahsoka was “expelled” from the Jedi Order, and we can see confirmation that she still has not rejoined the order in S7E10, where Kenobi mentions that due to her not being a member of the order, Ahsoka is unable to lead her battalion (hence Rex’s promotion to Commander). In turn, when Order 66 is assigned, the clones on her cruiser would not see her as a target, which would buy Rex the time he needed to get his inhibitor chip out. 

In the trailer, I don’t know who or what was firing at her, but I assume it could have been a Death Watch remnant or something similar. The reason I’m confident it wasn’t clones shooting her is that we haven’t seen Rex undergo the procedure to withdraw his inhibitor; which means that if he’s not shooting, his men shouldn’t be shooting either. 

Am I completely off? What do you guys think?",Random theory I came up with (S7 spoilers)
StarWars,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",Ironic
StarWars,"The whole sage of Anakin skywalker becoming Darth Vader to me is why this whole saga was interesting and epic ( even if sequels almost ruined it ).

StarWars,"So, I was thinking about the film recently and how they could have done better. When Kylo is facing the Knights and Rei is facing Palpatine, it would have been better to have the previous Skywalkers, Obi, and Yoda ghost appear. Rey vs the Knights and Palpatine, only to have the force users appear to defend and help Rey. I mean we've seen Luke ghost handle a lightsaber, why not hint that and then when the fight goes down have them show up. They could have easily found their sabers, appear, and fight the Knights while she fights Palpatine. Like Obi said, you can strike me down but ill be more powerful then you could ever imagine.

StarWars,"(*Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Red Fly Sudios; I am simply a huge Darth Maul fanboy.)

Hey guys!

I just want to raise awareness about the cancelled video game, Darth Maul: The Battle of the Sith Lords. I come to this subreddit really fired up after watching a YouTube video I stumbled upon talking about Red Fly Studio’s cancelled Darth Maul game. If you have never seen or heard about this game, look it up. This is a game that Red Fly has reportedly continued to improve and update since its initial development (and subsequent termination by LucasArts) before Disney purchased LucasArts.

Stealth, fear, violence; this is a possibility for a Star Wars game to be a deeply immersive experience - with a character that we cannot get enough of. In the right hands and with enough support we can make this happen!

Not promoting a certain direction, but for example, EA has responded to input from the Star Wars community.

The Point: Lets have a discussion about how we can make this amazing game happen. I feel that there is a huge population of Star Wars gamers and this game would obviously be a best seller with high quality support. How can we make the larger gaming companies aware that the community wants this game? Perhaps the Red Fly could even release the game on their own if they had enough funding without the large gaming companies.",We (the fans) can make the cancelled Darth Maul game happen.
StarWars,"I’ve brought this up before, but I feel this is badly needed. The sequel trilogy is a mess and has a lot of things left to be explained, especially with the last one. We never get to see Han and Leia have Ben or see Luke train Ben and his Jedi temple. (Not that narratively we need to see these just examples of things you could do). Explain if there’s more to the story of why Luke tried to kill Ben. How and why was the first order formed? What went into forming the new republic? How were planets we’ve already had established affected by this? (The sequel trilogy almost never covers this and always introduced new planets and characters instead of pre-established ones. The new planets they do introduce always look very similar to earth and are never creative). Who is snoke and when and why did he come into power? How is he a clone? How did Palestine survive? What’s a soul link or whatever? How come Rey didn’t become posed like he said when she struck him down? Significance of reys yellow lightsaber? Cover more of Leia’s training? How did the sith troopers just get there? Did Luke maybe have kids? (Probably not, but we can hope there’s still a living sky walker out there). Is Jains or whatever her name is Lando’s daughter? Does Finn have the force? When did Palestine have a child? Why did they give Rey up? When was Rey born and under what circumstances? There’s this anonymous character out there who was Palestine’s child? Will Rey form a new Jedi council? Was the chosen one prophecy really all for nothing? There’s many more questions and potential plot lines, I feel an animated series would be great to answer all the questions or I’m sure they could answer some of they in future movies if they still continue the sequel trilogy. Thoughts and other questions?",Clone Wars type series for Sequel Trilogy?
StarWars,"So I’m hoping I’m posting this with correct flair. Maybe someone can point me in right direction. So question is about getting a clone helmet and armor, since Clone Wars I have grown to love the clones. I have a helmet however it’s a Stormtrooper helmet. I would love love LOVE to get a clone costume like not some clothes bull crap they use for kids Halloween outfits. Actual helmet and everything. Would love a 501st helmet but if it’s plain then maybe someone too can direct me what to use to paint it and I’ll come up with something",Clone costume
StarWars,"Obi makes a remark that ""only the imperial stromtroopers are this accurate"", well we all know how true that is. He also says that ""sand troopers aren't accurate"", I'm sure pod racers would disagree. Also couldn't he be just lying to Luke in order to fuel his anger for the empire? I mean he lied to him in almost entirety of ANH. He said that -""you're father wanted you to have his lightsaber when you are old enough"", we know that he said nothing like that, infact obi-wan picked the lightsaber in front of burning Anakin. He also says that Vader killed anakin, which is less then half the truth. I won't be surprised if he lied to him once more",What makes obi-wan think that stormtrooper killed lukes aunt and uncle?
StarWars,"So I’m just curious, with the success and all the hype surrounding these last few episodes of Clone Wars, and if Marvel’s “What If...” series is successful, do you think there’s any chance they could do an animated version of “What If” that takes place in the Star Wars universe? I mean, it’s fun to toy with alternate universes and both studios are owned by Disney now so it seems totally possible. What if Anakin never killed Dooku? What if Ahsoka joined Maul in hunting down the Emperor? So many interesting routes to go down. 

Would you guys enjoy something like this? Do you think this is ever a possibility in the future? I, for one, would be positively STOKED for an animated Star Wars “What If...” series.",Star Wars “What If...” series?
StarWars,"Trying to piece together what we know

C-3PO has been property of the House of Organa since Anakin fell to the Dark Side and Padmé died (though he was droid-napped by Jawas, was briefly ""owned"" by Owen Lars, has been ""lent"" to the Rebellion and Resistance), so I presume Leia passed him into the possession of whatever becomes of the Resistance (I am laughing at the thought that Poe is his new master).

R2-D2 was essentially Luke's from ANH onwards until Ben fell to the Dark Side, at which point Luke abandoned R2. Somehow he came back into Leia's possession (did Luke drop him of before heading to Ahch-To or did someone find him abandoned?). I imagine his ownership fate is the same as C-3PO's.

The Millenium Falcon was Han's property when he died. He and Leia never actually divorced, so is it safe to say that Leia owned it, but left it in the possession of Rey, Chewie, and the Resistance? I imagine Rey or Chewie would own it, but I would think Chewie would be going back to his family on Kashyyk like he did post-GCW and wouldn't need it. I imagine Rey is the new owner.

What are your thoughts?","Who own C-3PO, R2-D2, and the Millennium Falcon post-TRoS?"
StarWars,"I have a lot of problems with the sequel trilogy, but actually found myself enjoying a lot of what Rise of Skywalker had to offer. However, one recurring joke annoyed the hell out of me. What I'm talking about is C-3P0's memory wipe. So, pretty much every pre-wipe line of dialogue that came out of 3P0's mouth was played for laughs (no real problem with that; pretty much the same in the rest of the series), either by merit of the line itself or Poe telling him to shut up. 

Where I started to have a problem was the scene where his mind is wiped. It is dramatic, considering this is the *second* time he will have lost everything. I actually found myself getting emotional during most of the scene, seeing one of the only characters left from the original trilogy capable of fully expressing himself (R2 and Chewbacca can communicate, yes, but it feels less real considering the audience can't understand them) about to lose his cherished memories of his friends.

Then, he came out with the ""I just thought of something else"" line as he was being wiped, and I knew the emotional drama had been thrown out of the window of a 747 at 35k feet. Cue every line after this (up until R2's backup, which also annoyed me because why didn't he do that the first time around?) being a joke about how he can't remember anything. Then, despite his sacrifice, Poe *continues* to constantly tell him to shut up even when he is expressing that he has lost his entire life's worth of memories.

It calls back to my biggest complaint with the Last Jedi, being the constant undercutting of dramatic moments with forced comedy. RoS, in my opinion, did much better in that regard but this one running joke *really* rubbed me the wrong way.",C-3P0 in Rise of Skywalker.
StarWars," Anyone else feel that most articles and blogs written about SW are behind the times in terms of what fans feel. For example, most articles written say that ""most fans hate the prequels"", but that is no longer true. Older fans don't like the prequels but younger ans who grew up with them love them. Many even say revenge of the Sith is the best movie. There are prequel fans all over the internet. Now it is a pet peeve of mind to use the terminology ""most fans"" or ""fans agree"" anyway (no one truly can speak for SW fans as we are a diverse group) but even when they do the statement is followed by something that is no longer true, which makes the writer seem even more out of touch.

StarWars,"I've always been more than a bit confused at how the actors and crew describes their feelings about A New Hope at the time.

They always talk about how they didn't think much of it, or expect much of it.  It was just supposed to be some little silly sci go romp that might fund other projects and it blew up larger than they expected.

What's always confused me is...that doesn't seem to line up with the effort put in.

The massive, complicated models. The effort that went into the sets and designs. The people they hired for the project like John Williams and Alec Guinness. The research put into things like ww2 dog fight footage.

StarWars,"It wasn't so much an effort to 'subvert expectations' (which is more an indication people were mad that the movie didn't follow their theories or head canon which is both weird and pitiful) but a logical decision to phase out some things while propping up others. 

So obviously the things in regards to Rey's parentage and Luke's self-imposed isolation are explained whilst Snoke's backstory was shunned more in favour to utilise that character as a red herring for Kylo's conflict and apparent resolution. 

The Knights of Ren, which we now know weren't entirely critical to the trilogy to begin or end with (since JJ didn't know what to do with them either), remain(ed) conclusively inconsequential.

StarWars,"Maybe I’ve totally missed something in the movie or expanded lore, but sending Maul to face the Jedi doesn’t seem like it makes much sense. His plan was to create a crisis that required a vote of no confidence so that he could become Chancellor, right? Does killing the Jedi help that goal? I guess he could have been concerned that they would have defused the situation too quickly...

But I prefer to think that this was a hit on Qui-Gon.

So we know Palpatine has visions of the future and whatnot, yeah? What if he saw this young Chosen One killing him? What if he saw Anakin as a Jedi being the one who could stop his plans? And what if he knew that only Qui-Gon was capable of training him successfully? 

Remember, the Jedi Council is basically a Republic police force at this point, and Jinn was really the only TRUE Jedi left, still following the will of the Force rather than playing politics. Could Sidious have seen Jinn and his new Padawan as the last real threat to his master scheme, and sent Maul to eliminate him? 

Without Jinn, not only will Anakin lack proper guidance, but he’ll be vulnerable to corruption. And it’s not like he was too worried about keeping Maul around, so even if that uppity Zabrak dies, it’s still a win!

Just a theory! Would love to hear your thoughts!",Why did Sidious send Maul after the Jedi in TPM?
StarWars,"Here is my list:  
A Luke Skywalker-Centric Game - After Jedi Fallen Order 2, I would love a Luke Skywalker game set after ROTJ with Luke learning more about the Jedi, discovering new powers, meeting Snoke and searching for Ixegol. Mark Hamill was so underutilized in the ST, and Disney has an opportunity to fix that with a game, and I would love to have him come back and voice Luke Skywalker as the hero he wanted to be.  
A Bounty Hunter game - Whether it is the Mandalorian before the show or the 1313 game we never got. Give me a Bounty Hunter game!  
Imperial Commando - Even though Battlefront 2 is kind of like this, I'd prefer a single-player focused game that is of the clone commandos. I would have the first level be Order 66 and have them go through a story set before ANH. It would be cool to see these commandos go and finish off the remaining separatists and fight surviving Jedi.  
Knights of the Old or High Republic - Reestablish the Old Republic or give us a new story set in the High, I don't care. The only bummer about the High Republic is no Sith (or at least no Jedi will survive a Sith encounter).  
What ideas do you have?",What future Star Wars games do you want?
StarWars,"I remember after watching Force Awakens I said that to my wife. 

I felt like this was the angle they were maybe going to go for. 

Rey had her natural intuition for the Force, Finn was immune to the stormtrooper conditioning and Poe was an incredibly skilled pilot.

They all feel like qualities that would come naturally to those who are strong with the Force.

Don't get me wrong, I know that the Force encompasses everything in the Star Wars universe, I'm not saying everybody has to be a Jedi, but I had a vision in my head of the trio all learning to be Jedi in their own way and working together to best Snoke, Ren and the First Order.

The image of the three of them on the Falcon together, all using their own unique lightsaber by the end of the third movie in a big battle - just a new breed of Jedi all working together to restore peace.

Maybe they have qualities that balance each other out as Force users and this is what leads to success.

StarWars,"Even in the weirdest times, May 4th is just around the corner. Origin already started its Star Wars sale with some ~~sexy~~ pretty good deals, I just checked Steamdb and the usual is that tomorrow Steam starts their sale.

So, as said in the title, what are some great deals to take this May 4th?

I already have Battlefront II (2005) with loads of mod which almost updated it with the Disney stuff and some Clone Wars stuff. Still, I might like to dive deeper into the SW EU.

I personally don't like RPGs and would be more up to a 3rd person/1st person shooter as BFII, but maybe I give an exception. If it helps, these are some periods I'd like to know more:

**The Phantom Menace Prequel:** And I guess that's what KotOR tell. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's here where I go to know about the story of Darth Revan  
**Mid to Late Clone Wars:** I'm not sure how this stuff is organized, but I loved the 2003 CW series (I know it's not canon anymore and didn't develop much more than an animated series). Still, I loved Asajj Ventress personality and really would like a game focused on these times and with a better approach to her.  
**Pre and During OT:** Following the CW, this is a period I'd like to know more too, and even consider writing a fanfic around this time. I loved Rogue One though I know there aren't many games focusing on it (And I'll give a better detail later). That's what was my main point which made me bought BFII at first.  
**Post ROTJ:** I'm reading (Though it's been more than months the last time I touched it) the first book of Thrawn trilogy, which already gave a solid sequel to the OT, so a game around this time is not completely essential, but I might consider buying it.  


I have a somewhat medium PC. I haven't tried any new game which it didn't play, though I never forced it too much. Still, I guess my main focus is early 2000's up to early 2010's, but I'm up to any exceptions.

If it doesn't make this post too vague, I also accept any eventual giveaway SW might do of any species or simply free cool stuff.",What would be great game deals to pick for May 4th?
StarWars,"They're simply too powerful to exist on their own without completely warping the story to become about the inevitable last-ditch effort to destroy said Death Star weapon.

My problem isn't that Death Stars exist in Star Wars. The most concerning issue I have is that lazy writers will just keep pulling Death Stars out of their ass to artificially amp up their story's dramatic stakes without earning any of it. The Sequel Trilogy has especially begun to set this precedent, with TROS literally having a fleet of Death Star Destroyers appear out of nowhere. Before long, we'll just be seeing the same shitty Death Star plots recycled over and over again, and the threat of a planet-busting weapon will become diluted to the point of being meaningless. Seriously, what's stopping the bad guys from just retreating to the ""outer regions"" again and coming back with another Death Star? Because the way the Sequel Trilogy frames its planet-busting weapons, it seems like anyone can just flee to the ""outer regions"" and casually pick up a Death Star weapon at Walmart when the going gets too tough.

When you look at the Prequels, The Clone Wars, the Old Republic, and countless other Star Wars ancillary stories, *none* of them needed a big stupid Death Star to amp up their narrative stakes, yet they told some of the most revered stories in all of Star Wars. Hell, there was no place you could even put a Death Star in most of these stories without ruining what made them special. These stories *earned* their narrative stakes through smart story construction and proper buildup of tension and payoff. They were so much more varied and interesting stories than just ""we have to destroy X thing, let's hurry up and destroy X thing"". 

Even looking at the Original Trilogy, the progenitor of the Death Star, I'd argue that the Death Star really wasn't the point. Rather, the crux of the Original Trilogy's narrative was about Luke's personal journey from a farmboy into the hero the galaxy needed. The Death Star was only a small part of the Original Trilogy's narrative. In contrast, TROS made a point to emphasize that everything was about stopping Palpatine's ""Final Order"", to the extent that the movie had no room for meaningful character-building between its protagonists, since everyone was in a rush to get from point A to point B to point C to Palpatine's planet.

Death Stars are also a very short-sighted and wasteful storytelling device, because they inherently preclude the potential for future stories. When the Hosnian System was destroyed, so was any potential for side stories on those cities/planets. When Kijimi got blown up, there's another planet and civilization you have just removed entirely from your storytelling arsenal. This is something I highly suspect the writers over-utilizing Death Stars don't understand. It would have been cool to see stories set on the cities of the Hosnian System. It would have been cool to see cosmopolitan life in the New Republic. But none of that means anything now, because you just blew up the damn thing before we got a chance to see any of it. *Sure*, you could technically write a whole prequel about the establishment of the New Republic on the Hosnian System or something, but it would just be completely pointless since we already know it'll all be turned into smoldering space debris before long. At worst, a story like that would be a bitter reminder of how much more we could've had if the writers had just thought things through.

It would be interesting to me if someone developed a planetary shield system to hard-counter a Death Star's capability. At the very least, it would force Star Wars' narrative to grow beyond the tired and simplistic formula of Empire vs Rebels, since the power dynamics would be much more level here, and the antagonists would have to find more interesting ways of waging war in order to subjugate the galaxy. See what this is? This is innovating beyond the Original Trilogy's narrative formula. Again, most of Star Wars' stories have already moved past using Death Stars as a plot device. I'm really not sure why the Sequel Trilogy thought it was a good idea to bring them back without understanding what made them work in the Original Trilogy.",Star Wars is in serious need of a hard counter to Death Star and Death Star-like weapons.

I’ve recently got a lot more interested in it and would like to explore the lore more so I figured I’d start with some of the famous animated shows that are offered and talked about a lot. However, I’m not sure which one to choose. The 2003 version’s style is definitely my preference (I’ve seen bits and pieces of it) but I heard the 2008 version is near perfect. (Have yet to see yet). Is there a major difference between the two? Is there anyway someone could explain the differences including pros and cons to each? Would love to get started with some help!

I've beard/seen people memeing about it, saying it's not the best, it shouldnt of been a thing. Honestly I think it's great. It's a different change of pace from all of the action clones vs droids, jedi vs sith, stuff like that and I enjoy that.

StarWars,"I've commonly come across people claiming that they consider Vader and Anakin to be different people which confuses me because Dooku and Palpatine for example are not considered to be different individuals than who they were they became Siths. 

And I doubt that Dooku killing Palpatine or Palpatine destroying the death star himself would make people sympathetic towards them since they are responsible for orchestrating a major galactic conflict to take over the galaxy. And in the case of palpatine, everything that happened during the empire. 

Maybe I don't fully understand how the dark side works but it seems like Anakin is treated differently so people can have an easier time with him being redeemed because they liked the person he was before enough, regardless of his crimes after becoming a sith.

Just like they faked Luke and Leia. I know it's just Lucas' heavy-handed writing,  and she probably did die. But I like to think she didn't. Leia said she'd seen her mother's face, of course, this could've been a force vision or most likely forgetfulness. But part of me wants a happier ending for her, where she secretly got to raise at least one of her children. Maybe much different, twin birth and spousal abuse are a lovely combination to create some nasty PTSD.

StarWars,"As a preface, I was **not** excited when this movie was announced and lowered my expectations once Lord and Miller fired/left the project. After first viewing, I liked it, but wasn't big on it.

This is probably my third time rewatching it and wow. There's so many cool things in this movie. Mimban, the train heist, mudtroopers, SPACE YACHTS, Teras Kasi, Lando, *Lando's capes*. I've warmed up to the Kessel Run, L3 and the marauders, too. Beckett and Dryden Vos are really fun to watch and it's such a shame they died. 

Also I really like Favreau as Rio Durant. He has a short amount of time but is really charming.

Do I think Lord and Miller's previous version would have been even better? Yes. *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Lego Movie, 21* and *22 Jump Street*, and *Into the Spider-verse* were either great or amazing and subverted their genres in the best (most non-controversial) ways. But Ron Howard's version is just some good ass Star Wars. 

It's a shame we don't have more material coming off of the story threads they started here. Any of its characters could easily migrate to their own spin-off series on D+!

StarWars,"I don't know if anyone else does this, but whenever I hear a line from Vader whether it be from a game, movie, show, or whatever, I always try to hear that same line in the voice of Matt Lanter and Hayden Christensen. A lot of times, I just can't picture it working. Sometimes lines of dialogue are too complex to seem like something they would say. For example, ""We need not be adversaries. The Emperor will show you mercy, if you tell me where the remaining Jedi can be found"". Try to picture either of them saying that. It just doesn't work in my mind. But, basically I was just wondering if other people do the same thing or if I'm just weird.",Matching up Christensen and Lanter with JEJ
StarWars,"After the prequels, he decided to stop Star Wars forever and admit that everything has an end. He realized the Saga could no longer be expanded without making the previous generation angry as fuck, creating an cumulative effect of negative reaction because, even if the younger generation gets seduced, previous ones (that are more than one after the prequels) will always be unsatisfied. Poetry and the path of the hero have a limit and repetition can only be tolerated when you put a different dress/context on it.

So, considering Star Wars market value will inevitably shrink year after year no matter what (like everything in this Universe), he tried to sell it now it had some worth. Disney's greed appeared into scene to buys it and make money: they failed.

Besides this rational motivation, Lucas felt the need for redemption because of Prequels mistakes. He knew Disney will screw it all, giving a new perspective by comparision. Today, Prequels are an absolute piece of art compared with Sequels, even for haters (usually Original gen).

startrek,"What I mean by that:

Often times the main characters encounter some kind of danger or pursue some kind of hint which sends them traveling through the galaxy, spanning great distances, jumping in and out of warp, etc.

The main characters of course know what's up: Captain Picard gives the order to ""set course for X, maximum warp!"" and off they go.

Or they get attacked and suddenly have to travel halfway across the galaxy. Or they orbit around a seemingly random planet because an away team hasn't returned.

The main characters as well as we, the viewers, obviously know what's up, why they're jumping from planet A to planet B in short succession or what just hit the enterprise to cause damage on decks 17 through 19.

But what about the ""normal"" personell? The regular people hanging out at the bar? On the holodeck? The families in their quarters?

How do they experience these seemingly random warp jumps? One moment they're looking out the window, maybe talking to a relative at home and then _WOOSH!! WARP 9 IN YOUR FACE!!_

Are they somehow informed on a moment-to-moment basis? Do they know that a Romulan ship just uncloaked infront of the Enterprise? Or are they left in the dark?

I'd be so confused all the time, never knowing where we are or _why_ we are there.

startrek,"First of all, sorry for my English or my mistakes.

I love ST Picard, but there's a big problem with starfleet ship designs. There are only a few original models: the Inqury-Class, the Utopia Planitia space tug, Mars defense ships and the McCall Shuttlecraft. But the Magee-Class (seen in Short Treks: Children of Mars) and the Class C Shuttlecraft are from the pre-TOS era! Why are 150 year-old ships still operational?

Let's try to answer. Obviously, the budget of the show was quite limited, but here's my ST canon theory:

In the 2230s the Class C Shuttlecraft was introduced. It was used in some starships and as a carrier on Earth until 2260s, and then it was replaced with other models, but it was still being used because of it's success (and maybe during its life it was updated a few times). I think some variants of this shuttle were the Galileo-class shuttlecraft (TOS era films), the Type 6 Shuttlecraft (a shorter version onboard the Enterprise D) and Type 7 Shuttlecraft (Enterprise D). After a century of using the Class C, I think the Federation reached the point of building tons of these crafts at a very low price. So that's why it's still in use.

What about the Magee-Class science vessel? This ship was an innovation when it was introduced in the 2250s, due to its compact configuration. Maybe it had modern technology enough to mantain the production. It's the same as the Miranda-Class ship (like the USS Reliant): It was still in use in the late 24th century (seen in DS9 and VOY) because of its power.

So that's my explanation, i hope you liked it.",150 years old ships in Picard?

The next generation and piccard first encounter the borg and time travel has been a big part of this go around so maybe even find a way to use both the original and use the film to introduce the next generation crew so the 5th movie would be a reboot of piccards crew.

Recently heard that  people were calling Michael Burnham a mary sue and I don't understand how that is. I have called out many characters as mary sues/gary stus and she does not seem to fit the criteria.

She is multidisciplinary in competence, but not much more so than a science officer(who typically have knowledge in multiple disciplines) who used to be a first officer and was training to be a captain. But most of her greater achievements were in her main field (figuring out the Klingon greeting, ""taming"" the tardigrade, which was sentient).

She is in the military, so she may have training in combat, but she loses up to 70% of the hand to hand fights she is in. Even against Sarek, she lost multiple times until she subdued him once (which is all she needed),  against the Klingon ""emperor"" she lost decisively, but he was toying with her so she had a chance to escape.

Most of her fights never end decisively, they end with either an escape or help from a friend.

Instead of classes like rogue, ranger, warlock, etc , I want to use officers. Instead of races like elf, dwarf, halfling, etc., I want to use core Star Trek races like Klingon, Vulcan, Romulan, etc.

Wouldn't it be a bit of a stretch for Starfleet to continously encounter Borg vessels both in and out of the DQ that are manned by Alpha and Beta Quadrant species? Especially species on the far side of Federation space?

I would assume that Beta Quadrant heavy species like the Romulans and Klingons would be more likely to find themselves assimilated due to proximity. I know it's more than reasonable that a Borg cube passing through the general area near Federation space has a high chance of running into humans, vulcans and other Federation citizens. But for the amount of times we see them in Voyager you'd think the majority of drones would be representative of DQ species.

startrek,"TLDR:  Star Trek always kind of ignores or minimizes the gruesome and terrible things that happen to the characters.  Are there any books or episodes that really examine the horror that comes from the Star Trek universe?

Long Version:  

So here's something that's always bugged me about Star Trek.  These people live in a world where they can suffer all manner of horrible deaths or injury, but nobody ever really talks about it and there never seem to be any real consequences.  Some of this stuff is straight-up nightmare fuel.  I'm talking about the crewman whose face gets removed (""Charlie X""), or the one who gets fused halfway into the floor (""In Theory""), or the ones who get turned into soup in a transported accident (""The Motion Picture"").  And the rest of the characters just go about their day, sometimes barely acknowledging what just happened.

There are a rare few episodes that really explore guilt and PTSD (eg. ""Family"" or ""It's Only a Paper Moon""), but these aren't nearly as common as they should be.  Most of the time it's just, ""Oh, that one lady got turned into a geometric piece of chalk, what was her name again?""  (“By Any Other Name"")  But I'm not really talking about PTSD stemming from combat or conventional deaths.  I'm more interested in the people who get turned into reptiles and other weird shit.   (I know Captain Bateson from ""Cause and Effect"" had a few appearances in novels and comic books that followed up on his story, and I thought that was really interesting.)

Shouldn't there be an asylum somewhere full of people suffering bizarre medical conditions and hideous deformities?  In ""Charlie X"" the aliens undo all the hideous things Charlie did, so it is assumed that the lady got her face back.  But what if there was a hospital somewhere trying to treat a woman whose face was obliterated?  Or cages housing half-human reptiles the Federation hasn't figured out how to cure?  What would it really be like trying to stay sane in a universe where, at any random moment, some space-time fluctuation could fuse your body into the bulkhead?  Or some alien God could snap his fingers and transform you into a D20?  It seems like being confined to a beeping wheelchair is actually kind of merciful compared to some of the horrible fates these people suffer. 

Is there any media (books, episodes, whatever) that really explores the long-term consequences of these things?",Star Trek Horror?
startrek,"Inspired by a post on a different thread where someone said many Vulcan actors confuse stoicism for being mean.

We all know that Vulcans can be boring assholes from whatever we've seen of them, but how much of this is simply informed by Spock, who is half-human? He had a very real reason for clinging to his Vulcan side, almost in a fanatical way we see Worf vs other Klingons.

I've always found it interesting that for all their logic, Vulcans never seem to find it might be easier to get along and work with humans through a ""when in Rome"" approach. 

This brings me to Xon, one of the three principle new characters for the unfilmed Phase II show and the only one not to be rewritten into The Motion Picture. We see that already he doesn't have the bowl-cut that Spock popularized (even his father's hair wasn't quite so uniform in TOS), and that his approach to being on the Enterprise was one where he sought integration rather than isolation - basically the opposite of Spock and more similar to Data. That is, being young and untested, he might awkwardly belly-laugh at a light joke when amongst a bunch of humans, so as to fit in. And because he doesn't have that human mother, there's nothing for him to tap into it when he really needs to. Rather than struggling his whole life to accept and integrate humanity from within, he would have to find it from with out. From the series bible:

&gt; What this means is: whereas Spock was engaged in a constant battle with himself to repress his emotions in order to be more Vulcan-like, Xon will be engaged in a constant struggle within himself to release his buried emotions to be more Human-like for the sake of doing a good job, his primary considerations. This will be at least as difficult for him as it was for Spock to maintain his stoic pose. Also, we'll get humor out of Xon trying to simulate laughter, anger, fear, and other Human feelings.

Being so early in the series, this could have redefined how Vulcans were perceived and written for the next 40 years. It troubles me so much that the monocultural tendencies of Star Trek have meant that basically all Vulcans are the same character, derived heavily from a guy who was only half-Vulcan. It would be a bit more like that Enterprise episode where the Vulcans crash in the past and the one guy decides he likes Earth. Just seems more realistic, and with more room for interesting development, to me.",Could Xon have changed the way Vulcans were written?

startrek,"It has been a while since I’ve been on my mission to explore all the Star Trek Universe out there. I’m a new fan and discovering this franchise has brought to me such joyous feelings I can’t even describe.

I’ve started watching TNG for a while now on every free time that I have. I have never had so much fun watching a series ever. If I’m not mistaken, it has been 33 years since the airing of the first episode and still, I managed to not know anything about it. I’m just discovering it all along this marvelous path.

Recently, I got to Season 5 and I gotta say... What a jump. S4 and S5 are completely different worlds to me. I feel like everything has been taken to another level, and it was already a really high one. 
Episode 2: “Darmok” was amazing. Something about it just feels new and refreshing despite having these characters that I’ve seen for so long now. The camera work is much more inspiring. The acting, my God. We all know how much Patrick Stewart is simply a master at this, but that scene when he was trying to understand Tamarian language by talking to the captain. 

It’s something about the main takeaway. “The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hope of communication…, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life”. 
That got to me. It got me on a REAL spiral of thought and I don’t even know why. Such a commitment to peace, to understanding. From someone who was a complete stranger in basically every aspect. That’s so pure and beautiful in a way.

This series is so many good things. It’s beautiful. It’s poetical. It’s artistic and has an incredible way of being relevant and showing us how good we can be as a species. It has changed me. To the better. It has made me look into myself to see what I can change to better as a person. I’m not saying I am perfect example now or something like that. FAR from it. But you better be sure as hell I’ll try to be the best I can from now on. To the people close to me and to every other.

I know this is an unusual post. And trust me, I know it is weird to project so much into fictional characters. But they feel so real to me in a personal level I’m sure some of you out there feels as well. At the times we live in of fear and separation, I cannot stress enough how grateful I am to be reminded of optimism. 

This optimism is powerful. Really powerful. But, most important, it’s moving. It has come to me on a time of such darkness, uncertainty and self-hatred. It is here when I need it most. When I needed to be reminded of how beautiful our world really is and to always keep my head up. Always keep it up. So I won’t miss out on anything.

Sorry for the confusion... It started as a little chat, devolved into opinions on one episode that I liked and now it’s me geeking out about my rekindled hope for myself and for all humanity. We did great things. We still do. And I won’t let some things shatter the hope I have for what’s to come.

Anyway, ever since I started watching TNG as I kid i always looked up to Picard, he was just, the type of person I wanted to be in nearly every way. Idk why but I never watched family on my first run of watching season 4, must’ve thought it would be corny episode from the name and skipped it, but I realise now that I’m a fool for not watching it because when I saw Picard after fighting his brother lay in the fields between the bushes covered in mud, break down and cry and say things like “ I wasn’t strong enough” the same thing I say to myself in my weakest moments, it brought me close to tears, that the character I admire so much could be that helpless, that weak,  it made me feel so utterly close to him in a way I never have felt close to a character before. The day afterwards, I will still going through some shitty situations with unhealthy compulsions I had in my darkest days and when I was about to hold in the tears I thought about Picard, in the vineyard, crying and saying things I was thinking at that moment and for the first time in a years, I cried in a way that was ok, that I wasn’t ashamed of, that was just me letting it all out.

startrek,"This is a spoiler for Enterprise I guess. 

The borg are a classic part of TNG. A key part of their introduction is that we see Q, an all powerful troll, flick enterprise further across the galaxy than anyone has ever gone to encounter an entirely new species unlike anything humanity has ever encountered. Our heroes escape by the skin of their teeth, and The Federation desperately tries, and fails, to prepare for their return. 

So of course Enterprise reveals that the Federation has encountered these guys before. And it’s not one lost ship like in Voyager. Nope. Scientists know about the borg, admirals know about the Borg, and the original earth flagship encountered them at close quarters and even got to hear their catchphrase “resistance is futile.” They also managed to beat them pretty handily with pretty primitive weaponry. Their doctor even managed to cure himself of Borg nanoprobes. 

But I guess no one wrote any of this down? Archer skipped his Captain’s Log on this one? The crew of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D, the cream of the crop and absolute best starfleet has to offer never spent any time reviewing the adventures of their predecessors? Maybe I could buy it if the only encounter with the Borg was in Q-Who, but when they come back in season 3 they make it clear that all of starfleet has been on alert. Not a single person in starfleet, when reviewing the historic threat reported by Captain Picard and his crew, thought “hey I feel like I’ve read about something similar to this?” 

Prequels don’t have to suck. Better Call Saul is currently putting on a clinic other shows should watch on how to deepen the story we’ve already know rather than ruin it. But why most prequels insist on giving people familiar faces to recognize over stories that make sense or complicate what we’ve already seen is beyond me. Crap like this or making Michael Spock’s sister are unforced errors that suck you out of the story while you try to do the narrative gymnastics the writers won’t do for you to make this stuff make sense. 

This episode was garbage, and I’m surprised I’ve never read about it before.",Friggin Prequels
startrek,"I just watched the DS9 episode Second Skin where Kira is kidnapped by cardassians who try to make her believe she is Iliana, the daughter of a Legate who went undercover on Bajor durring the resistance. I remember from previous watch through we never actually learn what really happened to Iliana after she went undercover on Bajor.

Assuming she's alive, that means we're looking for a Bajoran who is in some sort of position of power, or likely to reach one, or someone who is doing harm to Bajor as it is. And then I realised that's basically Kai Winn (who at this point is already Kai). Think about it:

1) Shortly after the withdrawal from Bajor, Winn was a powerful religious head with some support to become the next Kia, and within a year of the withdrawl the old Kai died.

2) She's not exactly the model Vedec/Kai, but would make a great Cardassian. She is regularly seen scheming and attempting to grab power, but always through others in a way that leaves her off the hook when things go wrong. She is manipulative, opportunistic, and power hungry.

3) Spoilers for season 7, but when she does learn that the man she fell in love with and has had assisting her is Dukat and not some Bajoran, she is angry but still carries on with Dukat's plans and sticks with the Pa Wraiths. Now most Bajorans who lived through the occupation would probably have Dukat executed (something the Kai and Minister is certainly able to do with the support of the people), and most would probably reject the path Dukat put Winn on. Perhaps her relatively kind forgiveness of Dukat, and maybe even the initial attraction in the first place, is becouse he is a fellow Cardassian.

Now with the last two points you could say that Iliana's memories would have been erased and replaced with Bajoran memories. However at her core Iliana is still a Cardassian who joined the Obsidian Order out of a sense of duty to the state. At some instinctual level she may still have traditional Cardassian tenancies for espionage and power lust. After all her DNA would still be partially Cardassian (or else Bashir's DNA test of Kira would have meant nothing at the end of this episode).

In the end there's no way to prove it, but I personally like the idea that the woman that Legate, and to a lesser extent Kira herself, were looking for was right under their noses the whole time and still fighting for Cardassia in a very different way to her loving dissident father, and latter on her ""adopted sister"".",Could Winn unknowingly be Cardassian agent Iliana?

The teleporter has been kind of inconsistent throughout the different series, I know. One theory suggests that it destroys the subject on one side and then reassembles them on the other using entirely different particles (which means the teleporter has potential to become an effective duplicator as seen with Kirk and Riker), but I've also heard that the teleporter uses the same particles that its gathered from the ""beam"" to reassemble the same person.

I’m wondering what you think, based on your assumptions about the future, Star Trek will have to include that they might have never previously thought of.","People that dig into futurology, what will be different about a Star Trek episode in, say, a hundred years to reflect changes in cultural attitudes and technological advances?"

I know it's a beam and, if pointed at say Earth, it could revert, or in VOY's case, completely erase entire civilizations from the timeline. This of course backfires on the Krenim. Does that imply that technically, Earth and the rest of the Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta quadrants suffered changes as well? Or do these changes ripple out, but only so far? As in the Krenim Impirium's case after altering the timeline by erasing the Rilnar? 

In short, are temporal incursions local or universal? If they're local, or is there a middle ground where these changes ripple out? Sort of like a rippling effect in water and the changes weaken the further it travels through spacetime.","When Annorax and the Krenim perform a temporal incursion, do the changes to the timeline affect all of space time, or is it just felt locally?"

startrek,"I keep hearing folks criticizing voyager and the new shows for not having enough philosophical stuff in them and not being as progressive as some of the other shows. 

This is very strange to me, because as much as I enjoy the philosophical aspects of star trek, I always thought the main attraction of trek were the interactions between the diverse and likeable crew members, its classic discoveries, mishaps, and adventures, and the incredible quality of writing that never disappoints. 

I always assumed that the morality presented in trek was just the result of its premise, that in the post scarcity world of the future, we would have learned to be better than we are now.

startrek,"I was thinking about this the other day. Why is it that transporter range is so limited? Applying real life logic and science to a completely made up thing is going to hit some roadblocks pretty quick, but still.  

If you think of transporter pad to arbitrary location transporting, that seems... super impossible, but ignoring that, it makes a lot more sense for that to have a distance limit. 

But if you're talking about transporter pad to transporter pad beaming, it seems like the distance could be almost unlimited. And in cases of common long distance transport, like for example between Earth and Vulcan, it seems like it would be well within the technology as we know it, to built a series of transport repeaters along the way. That way you could beam all the way to other planets. Think a copy of the subspace relay station we've seen on TNG. A small structure that would take inbound transporter signals and relay them to the next station. There is inhabitable space inside so if something happened along the way, you could be materialized on the station instead of trying to be sent back, or being lost in transit.",Long Distance Transporting

startrek,"I'm not the biggest fan of Nemesis but I just realised how its introduction of the Remans could have actually helped Picard's plot make any damn sense.

The issue you have with Picard is that even if the one planet of Romulus went boom they still have a gigantic STAR EMPIRE. This led to some major headscratching moments. Why can't the Romulans be relocated to anywhere on the hundreds if not thousands of worlds within that empire? Why would they be reluctant to do so? Why are the members of a closely restricted society being let into the rest of the Alpha quadrant? Why are immense resources being spent on other things?

That would all make much more sense if it was the Remans who were refugees because the supernova took out their neighbouring world too.

1. As a small ""cannon fodder"" minority disliked by Romulans, they would probably be refused relocation on other worlds within the Star Empire, mirroring the situation where its often small minority groups that are made refugees.

2. The Romulans have the resources to spend but just don't care and have focused on only helping those on Romulus.

3. As the Remans are an ugly warlike race, it would have a broader message about judging others on appearance.

4. Federation resistance to helping the Remans makes more sense since its not seen as a federation problem and the Remans are known largely for having staged a coup and trying to send a giant death ship to earth.

5. Picard would feel a deeper connection to helping the Remans due to his background with Shinzon and would feel more guilt about letting them down.

startrek,"So I read once that the original intentions were for the Excelsior model to be the new Enterprise but the model was really difficult to work with so they went with tried and true Constitution

Assuming that anecdote is true I can’t decide how I would have felt if that had come to pass.

Excelsior blew my mind when I saw it in ST III and I’m pretty sure I would have been thrilled if Voyage Home ended with an Excelsior class ship  named Enterprise-A left Spacedock and Kirk
ended the movie with that “let’s see what she’s got”.

Would Star Trek V has been impacted a lot if that had happened?  Not really but at least the scene where they rocket in the turbolift shaft to deck 74 “might” have made more sense (not really but just being generous) 

Star Trek VI is obviously a bit of a different movie but they certainly could have worked around it.

All in all I’m glad the Constitution refit is the iconic ship of the Original-Series movies and they really didn’t do a ton with the ship where the narrative changes if Enterprise A is an Excelsior so just comes down to that moment at the end of Star Trek IV...

...incredible if they went with the new model but for the legacy of the movies they made the right choice. IMHO

But, except for 2 slip ups (The Sound of Thunder and being perfectly fine with Emperor Georgiou leading Section 31), Captain Pike was a breath of fresh air and a fantastic captain. Originally I thought I would love a Pike series. But then I realized a Pike series would include Spock, and I instantly fell off it. I \*hated\* the protrayal of Spock in Discovery and think it was domed to fail. Watching season 2 //I thought in order to maintain the Spock we see in TOS he probably couldn't really emotionally make up with Michel. Not only did he do that but he had a complete emotional revelation and basically vowed to embrace his human side. This is a man who has the line ""Ah yes, one of your human emotions"" like 7 years latter! Additionaly I have problems with the portrayal of a Spock who openly laughs out loud in the Short Trek, and even had problems with the idea that he went insane becouse non-linear time existed. ""Time has been the root of all my logic"", I thought the Vulcans got over the whole ""The Vulcan Science Academy yada yada yada Time travel is impossible"" thing 100 years ago? Not to mention coherent logical time travel could exist in many ways, weather possible or not.

Add to that the fact that a Pike series would still likely be lead by the Discovery team, and face the same prequel problems as Discovery with similar writing and do you really want a Pike series anymore? Not to mention what crazy unseen additional upgrades the Enterprise itself would receive. It took Discovery 2 seasons to realize they made a mistake and nope out of being a prequel, and I don't really want to see it happen again. Plus the longer a Pike series went on the more pressure there would be to look like TOS as that 7 year window shrinks with each season.

In breif with the right team a Captain Pike series could be great, but I think there's to much trouble in the past from Discovery, and to many complications from TOS in the future. On top of the complete lack of faith I have for the Discovery writing team, I just think it would do more harm then good at this point, and I want to know what others with similar opinions about discovery think.","If you hated Discovery, do you want a Pike series?"

startrek,"Vague post stemming from a vague memory. 

I have Googled around for this episode and simply cannot find it. I remember an episode where Riker is kidnapped or lost and gets swept up in a war. He makes friends with the people he is with who are one side in this war. Meanwhile, on the Enterprise people from the other side are somehow aboard the Enterprise and warn Captain Picard that when Riker returns he will want to kill then since he has been subject to advanced propaganda. I remember the word 'nullified' being used in the episode to describe kills in the war by the alien race.

What was this episode?",TNG Looking for an episode where Riker was subject to advanced alien propaganda and takes sides in a war
startrek,"In my odyssey to watch every season and movie of Star Trek, I have completed the first season of the Original Series.

Coming from a guy that's not a fan of TOS, I have to say that it was much better than I remember. I probably won't be owning any of the seasons, but I enjoyed myself. A lot of people characterize this series as corny, but I don't think they give it much credit.

The one who really surprised me was Shatner. I expected him to be especially hammy, but he was actually very well reserved. My favorite character, though, has to be Bones.

The only thing that kept bringing me out of it was the creature effects. I don't expect it to be Jim Henson worthy, but it at least has to be better than Classic Who.

Right now, I'm going to take a break from Star Trek, and watch the very first season of Doctor Who. When I get back to it, it'll be on to season 2 of TOS.",Finished TOS Season 1!
startrek,Ok. I like boxing. Rocky is one of my favorite movies. But for some reason the writers thought it would be a good idea to have an episode where Chakotay communicates with aliens though boxing. Like what even? Why did the alien tell him the information by screwing with his mind and preparing for a boxing match when they could of obviously just told him though his visions. Also all the stuff with Chakotay's gene makes no sense at all. Pretty boring episode in my opinion instead they should of focused on how to traverse through the black hole the aliens put them in kinda like a classic TOS episode. You can show that Chakotay likes boxing just don't make it the focus it doesn't really work.,"""The Fight"" What even is with this episode?"
startrek,"Hopefully it's allowed? I was hoping there'd be a thread for basic questions because I don't wanna clog the page with just a few small questions.

Star Trek: Next Gen, DS9 and Voyager fairly episodic? Or do I have to watch episodes in order to fully gain context? 

Do those series have endings? I noticed they're each a TON of seasons long, with 20-something episode seasons to boot. If I watch the show all the way to the end, am I given a satisfying conclusion or is it just when the networks decided to end the show?

Is there a list or something fans have made that tells me specifically which episodes to watch that skip some filler or monster of the week episodes? Kind of like the what fans have done for X-Files and Adventure Time? I'd like to really get into these shows but maybe not by watching 500+ hour long episodes.

Also wow. I know they say Doctor Who is the longest running sci-fi serial but Star Trek seemingly is on track to passing it up when you account for the number of ""series"" it had.",So out of nowhere I want to get into Star Trek and have questions
startrek,"In Star Trek II, in order to take control of some of Reliant's systems, Kirk devises a plan to use the ""prefix code"" to, in 21st century terms, Remote Desktop into the other ship and turn off Shields.msc.  This is very clever and allows for the bloody nose the Enterprise gives the Reliant and allowing them to buy some time.

In Star Trek III, when stealing the Enterprise, the Excelsior is sent to chase.  Whilst not directly said, the plan seems to have been to use a tractor beam to hold the Enterprise in place, and if it tried to out-run the Excelsior, that would be unsuccessful as it has the new Transwarp drive. Captain Styles comments ""If he tries to get away with warp drive, he's really in for a shock.""

Kirk is quite concerned about the Excelsior's advanced speed, and whilst Scotty has done his best to disable the engines, it's not of course guaranteed - ""Scotty, we'll need everything you have.""

Here's the bit that's the missed call back - Whilst I assume Kirk would know to change the Prefix of the Enteprise (given Star Trek II) ahead of time - it'd have been neat to see someone try it on the Enteprise only for it to fail as a result.  

It'd have been the absolutely perfect moment out of any time in Trek to do it - a Federation ship, at headquarters, is being stolen - the systems engineers in Space Dock should be trying to remotely access it to turn off the engines.  

Obviously they either don't or can't because no mention of it is said in the script.  

I just think it would have been a really neat bit of continuity to have it mentioned, and it'd have shown the crew to be quite clever in the process.

What do you think?",Star Trek III (1984 version) - the writers missed an open call back to TWOK when stealing the Enterprise
startrek,"Haha I love it in DS9 that they have all the tension with Jadzia 

Julian going after her never really getting anywhere, 

Quark trying it on now and again,

and Sisko finds her attractive but they obviously can't really go down that route on the show because how they make a big point of him being friends with Curzon for so long...

Then he just goes to the mirror universe completes a mission then nails her and goes home not saying a word about it! hahaha...

&amp;#x200B;

She does slap him when he returns to the mirror universe for sleeping with her while pretending to be the other sisko - and he just says that impersonating him was the point and goes on. hahaha.

Just smoothly doesnt mention it when he gets back, bet that time the mission brief was brief. 

Would have been awkward if he had brought Jadzia to the mirror universe the second time when she came over and slapped him.

But she wasnt there, so as the saying goes, what happens in the mirror universe, stays in the mirror universe! hehe",sisko you old dirty dog :0

WORF: There's something I wish to discuss with you. 

SISKO: Go on.

WORF: It has come to my attention that First Omet'iklan has threatened to kill you. 

WORF: As your executive officer, I recommend that you stay on the ship during the away mission. That way Omet'iklan will have no opportunity to carry out that threat.

SISKO: I appreciate the concern, but do you really think I'm going to follow that recommendation?

WORF: No, sir, I do not but I hope you will take some advice. Do not turn your back on him.

startrek,"Narration episodes are when one character frames the plot for viewers by dictating the circumstances going on around them. This usually happens in the form of writing a letter, such as VOY's *Thirty Days* or ENT's *Dear Doctor*. It can happen in other ways though, such as dictating a log to the computer- DS9's *In the Pale Moonlight* is the prime example. These episodes are often a change from the normal pace and offer perspectives we might have heard otherwise and thus are generally favorably received.

:- ok so maybe I was being a lil disingenuous in my last log entry, there is one MASSIVE perk to being posted on this mission. Individual, single person quarters for everyone, even the crew people baby! My own quarters with my own bathroom, not sharing a toilet with three other people. I mean ok, it's a wreck right now but when I get a lil time to myself I'll be able to make my perfect cave. Just between us computer, I looked into it and the Bajoran government ain't got no narcotics laws, and since this station is Bajoran property and not Starfleet, I'm totally going to be able to start a weed grow here. I suppose I should address the elephant in the room, the big event I'm sure everyone else is yammering into their logs about. The first stable wormhole ever to be observed by anyone from the known alpha quadrant has appeared in the Denorios belt. Yeah I know, I buried the lead, but what happened next was a lil traumatic for me so I had to warm up to it. The officers decided that they wanted a nice view of the thing from ops so up and moved the station, at what felt like warp factor 9.9 but I have been assured was more like high impulse, right outta orbit with Bajor and up to the belt. Why was this such a traumatic experience? I hear literally no one ask. Its because at the time I was in the service conduits hunting Cardasian Voles for the Cheif. It felt like the inertial dampers failed completely at one point and I slammed my head off a ceiling joist when the deck plating started to separate. I'm sure it was all worth it, I'm sure the commander has a lovely view from his office now. Sorry, I dont mean to be salty, the commander is a good guy, but seriously come on.
In other news I couldn't get the ferengi, his name is Quark, to order any Tennants but I think I've got him to understand the concept of lager, in the meantime, I'm not going to lie, I've picked up a liking for this Cardasian stuff he has called Kanar.

startrek,"I hope this finds you all well, even in these troubling times.

I write to you all about something we all, ostensibly, hold dear. 

Star Trek was a saga of unbridled optimism, where a triumphant humanity tried to solve external conflicts through compromise and peaceful mediation if possible. A reality in which the civilized ideal was to be promoted even against the highest odds, and in which it was possible to achieve the moral outcome, even if hard fought over. 

In every episode a world of philosopher kings and poet warriors awaited us, and in every struggle with an alien foe or in every difficult decision made, we learnt more about ourselves and what it is to be human. With each captain from Kirk to Archer, Star Trek grappled with *our* human condition.

This is a requiem I offer regretfully, to the universe that for all its utopianism, reached out a heart-warming hand and beckoned us to a shining world of hope and idealism. 

From its predisposition towards the view screen and inspirational dialogue, to its underpinning ideology of social harmony and progress set against the backdrop of distant space, Star Trek was the equivalent of the choicest Classical Greek poetry combined with the popular tropes of humanist exceptionalism and manifest destiny. 

After somberly watching the last episodes of *Enterprise* it struck me that only though a miracle would I lay eyes upon the same vision, the same metaphysical and physical fabric that had kept me occupied from TOS till now. 

Unfortunately, it seemed that the indomitable 'wheel of time' had struck again, its spokes ever turning, with Roddenberry's legacy a mere footnote in the decision making processes that formed the thinking behind the 'Kelvin' Timeline, *Discovery* and *Picard*.

What happens, in the pursuit of linear progress, if we take a wrong turn? What if we, aesthetically, culturally and ideologically are marching ignorantly down the wrong path? Who is to say that whilst the technological foundations necessary for furthering the Star Trek franchise improve and change, that the core, intrinsic beliefs of the ST universe must change with them? Can we not have one without the other? Why must we subscribe to the view that change is self vindicating? 

The irony abounds, in our reality we suffer the ignoble cruelty of a corrupted linear progress, which has cut us off from one of the few genuine visions of pure progress that has ever graced this earth.

To capture the essence of Star Trek's original aesthetic and ideological message, long forgotten, and to analyses, preserve and work towards its restitution one glorious day. This is my dream.

I envisage a social media network, to promote this platform, and am looking for an experienced team from reddit to first help create a subreddit, and collaborate in each wing of the broader platform.

Is there any example of this for the Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians or even the Ferengi? I'm particularly interested in The Romulans because we know The Borg have at least studied them. Additionally I can pretty easily play out in my mind how the conflict would go with most of the species. The Klingons for example would probably fight valiantly, maybe use their cloaks to their advantage and they would either simply lose, or warp right into the cube when the situation was most dire. I imagine they'd just go for the overwhelm the cube with force and either they'd have so many ships it would whittle them down slowly, or they'd just be eviscerated.


But how the Romulans approach conflict and their philosophy around it makes me wonder how they'd handle a Borg Incursion, I have a few thoughts on the matter and I'm wondering if there's any canon material that explores the idea? If there's any on the Ferengi, I imagine that would also be an entertaining read/watch for different reasons.",Are there canon examples of The Borg making incursions into the space of any of the other main factions?
startrek,"We know that Romulans knew Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant before it happened. And personally I expected Tuvok to betray Janeway in the final episode the way he betrayed Chakotay to Janeway in Episode 1 and reveal himself to be Romulan, But what if not only was the Cardassian Seska pretending to be a Bajoran, but characters were changlings from Gamma Quadrant, members of Section 31 - who had access to knowledge of Voyager's journey thanks to Starling's sattelite filled with his 31st century database from the crashed time ship?",What if more Characters on Voyager had been Traitors and spies?
startrek,"I'm making my way through season two of Discovery and got to the Airiam episode. I was disappointed in how ham-fisted it was in setting up Airiam as an amazing person. 

The funeral scene at the start of the next episode sets it up as equivalent to the death of Spock in The Wrath of Khan, but there's just nothing there to warrant that. 

If they had someone other than the main cast eulogize her, to make it appear that she had a different clique that she spent time with, that would be better. If they worked in more interaction over time, such as Airiam helping Tilly with May, I would have believed it more. 

Oh well.",Airiam

Despite Khan and his people taking over the whole ship, almost destroying the vessel and seconds away from killing Kirk, he makes the decision to beam them down to a planet to build an empire taking the pretty ensign with them. This, to me is like being burgled and then buying the burglar acres of land on the other side of the world to do with as he pleases. I completely understand that violence is always a last resort from their perspective and they would never kill unless absolutely necessary, but it just seems a bit redundant to simply let them go.

There’s a flurry of activity as people go to their action stations. And what do these guys do? They take a big step forward. That’s it. They move forward. Their big idea for red alert is to move into the walkway. Another officer actually has to go out of her way to scoot behind one of them and the wall so she can get onto the turbo lift.

So, my question is: how did Reliant and her crew, probably before even entering the system, *not* notice that the system is short one planet? Would there not have been at least a minor asteroid field where CA6 was before? And couldn't they count planets out from the local star and said, ""Nope, that's 5, keep going?""

One defence I'd have for these episodes (except Sub Rosa, that episode should be burned, replicated and then burned again) is that they seem quite tongue-in-cheek and are never meant to be taken seriously, but it's hard to defend an episode that makes you feel like you've just watched Little House on the Prairie in space","Rewatching ""Fair Haven"" (VOY)..."

For what reason would the general Starfleet staff need to know that you have romulan genetics unless they believe that because of that simple fact you may be a threat?

* It is a ""get together"" fanfiction pre-movie 2009 during the academy days.
* I believe this is the start of Nyota's Starfleet Academy days, mainly because of a scene where all new cadets are being assessed in terms of their martial arts capabilities and only she manages to get to the fourth mat with Spock and manages to last the required minutes and subsequently gets to learn Suus Mahna.
* The instructor that teaches Suus Mahna to her is being inappropriate and uses more force then necessary. Spock realises this, reports it and becomes her teacher instead.

startrek,"I'm re-watching VOY for the first time in years, and I realized something startling - Kes is largely responsible for the Doctor becoming who he was by the end of the series. 

When I finished VOY awhile back, I wrote a relatively long review on this sub and mentioned that my two favorite characters were easily the Doctor and Seven. Kes, on the other hand, was largely forgettable for me. I was happy when she left, and Seven was such an improvement that I basically forgot about her. 

But going through Season 1 again, I realize that Kes is literally the *only* crew member that treats the Doctor as a person. She asks him for his name, and stands up for him repeatedly to Janeway and the others. Not only does this change the entire trajectory of the Doctor's 'life', **but it also prepares the Doctor to have a similar impact on Seven when she joins the crew.** 

So in effect, my two favorite characters on VOY would have never been even a fraction of what they became without Kes's kindness. This doesn't entirely make up for other faults in the writing/acting of her character, but it certainly makes me appreciate her so much more.",An appreciation for Kes (VOY Rewatch)

They walk around and inject you with the nanovirus instead of just taking you prisoner and doing a surgery to assimilate you like they did with Picard. They were much more eerie back then. In Q Who, crusher, Worf, and Data were able to walk around the cube while the Borg just stood there, staring at nothing.

He tested on his own people.  Sure, as he says, his wife was accidentally killed by one of them.  So if we assume she was the only one, he had her dissected to learn about the creature's effect on the brain, and while she was living he learned about how it made her prone to suggestion.

Obviously this was my favorite show as a kid, but over the years I didn't watch much and I always assumed a big part of what I liked was just nostalgia,  and that maybe I ascribed a little more worth than it deserved.   

But...look at this 4 episode stretch in the middle of season 5: Ethics, Outcast, Cause and Effect, The First Duty.  Thats where I am.  And that's just one stretch.  Darmok, Silicon Avatar, The Game were all earlier.  And looking ahead, theres a stretch with I Borg, The Next Phase,  Inner Light, and Times Arrow.  It's like a TNG greatest hits except they were just all on the same album.  I honestly didn't remember they were all around each other like this.  

As a kid I preferred the action episodes.   ""Are you prepared to die today"" was like, my favorite scene of all time.  But now I'm seeing so many little nuances in ""character"" episodes that I barely liked before.  Like in Ethics, when Worf is coming back to life at the end,  there's a shot of Troi hugging Alexander for like 2 seconds.  And I got choked up at that a little.   

I like how theyve focused away from Picard alot, to focus on others.  It's not ""the Picard Show"" every episode.  Riker, especially,  has had a ton of good development lately.   

Anyway, this is prime Trek, and some of the best TV of all time.",TNG Season 5
startrek," My points per episode this time around are brief.  Not sure why that is.

**Episode 17: Rules of Engagement**

* This felt like *Law &amp; Order: DS9*. Great episode.  
* ""But *I* do not feel like celebrating"" reminds me of ""I am not a merry man.""  If the *Captain Worf* show is ever made, they need to use some of the dialogue from this Sisko-Worf exchange and some other exchanges from TNG.  Good character continuity for Worf. 

**Episode 18: Hard Time**

* Old Man Miles.  20 year virtual prison sentence. Poor Miles. 
* Keiko is such a good wife, covering him up on the floor.  O'Brien has cracked.   Maybe he's experiencing another virtual prison?  That would be awful.
* Killing Ee'char over some hidden food. At that point, I understand his anger. 
* O'Brien's recovery would linger for the rest of a season in today's shows.

**Episode 19: Shattered Mirror**

* Jennifer Sisko is just gonna drop by from the mirror universe?  
* ""I don't trust tall men...""
* Love these Mirror Universe episodes.  I wish *TNG* had done one or two of them.

**Episode 20: The Muse**

* Odo does the most to rescue Momma Troi from her crazy husband. Watching them together is bittersweet.
* Jake is getting his brain energy drained by that strange Onanya lady, but is able to write like he's running out of time...which he probably is considering the nosebleed. 

**Episode 21: For The Cause**

* Kassidy!  Hold up, it's Eddington that I should have kept an eye on!  
* Garak is out here worrying about his life. 
* Poor Sisko, having to turn his girlfriend in. I knew I couldn't trust her.  Glad she wasn't as bad as Eddington though.
* I wonder how much more Maquis stuff is in the show.  This reminds me I need to check how long *Voyager* and this show were on together.  Though, it's only *Pilot/T*he *Caretaker* episode w/ the Badlands and Maquis that really crossover.

**Episode 22: To The Death**

* The Jem'Hadar are back! 
* Also LeVar Burton is behind the camera!  That's probably why the episode opened with prone juice. More Worf continuity.  Maybe the closing shot of the *Captain Worf*  show is his him drinking prune juice, or maybe he orders it like Picard orders Earl Grey on *TNG* (I haven't watched *Picard* yet, but I would be surprised if he didn't get at least one cup in).
* Good setup to have Starfleet and the Jem'Hadar working together.

**Episode 23: Body Parts**

* Quark goes dark and the O’Brien’s baby.
* Hilarious episode. Value life more than rules. 
* The looks among Keiko, Miles, and Nerys was a great bit of acting (when they ask Kira to move in, revealed later in the episode).  

**Episode 24: Broken Link**

* Odo spasming out is sold well by Rene.  
* Good to see Kira is still pregnant.  
* Worf asking about Curzon is funny too.  
* They couldn’t put Odo on a gurney? Too much pride, Odo.  
* The Founders made Odo sick. Interesting. 
* Good to see the Great Link come back. 
* Garak discovers the beef between the Founders and the Cardassians.
*  I'm guessing this sets up a Founder/Dominion Cardassia invasion later.  
* Garak is about trading lives, ""a little genocide in the name of self defense.""
* They made Odo a SOLID?!?  Didn't see that coming. I guess no more shape shifting for him, he gets to sleep like a normal humanoid now. Great character development for Odo.

startrek,"I started watching TOS five months ago and  now I am a few episodes away from ending TNG. I ask this because... I didn't like TNG, or at least I didn't think it was better than TOS. Just to name a few things I didn't like:

Data is an excellent secondary character, but the episodes with him as the protagonist (and all his arc) seemed very boring to me.

Worf must be the worst-handled character in the series. Every time he gave a recommendation as head of security, someone else said that it wouldn't work. On the other hand, the episodes with Worf as the protagonist seemed to me the best.

All seasons have 5 or 6 episodes exactly the same: something to solve in the holodeck (worst of the series imo), a crew member returns to the Enterprise after a short trip and the rest crew appears to be changed, Picard leaves the Enterprise on some mission and ends up lost on some uninhabited planet, and so on.

But what I like least compared to TOS is that they do not respect the motto of the series: *to seek out new life and new civilizations*: one episode, hopefully two, of each season, were about making contact with new civilizations. And that sucks.

My friends recommend DS9, which they tell me is more serial and not so episodic. I am thinking of jumping directly to Discovery. What do you recommend me?",Whats next?
startrek,"I was rewatching SFDebris' review of The Final Frontier. He mentions that its unusual that Sybok, a person who seeks God, would not have a dialogue with Spock about his death and resurrection. For one who seeks God would want to speak to such a person. Fair point. But I wonder, exactly how much knowledge about that event is actually made public. Like, would Sybok even know that Spock was dead in the first place? Because would't information about a Starfleet Captain being killed be a 20th century genetic superman with a weapon of mass destruction, funded by the government, and the Captain's said resurrection be something that Starfleet would classify? Like I don't see how Sybok would even know that and thus would be an unfair criticism of the film.

Further, exactly how much information is the Federation public actually allowed to know. Because I can't imagine a FNN broadcast going like this:

""Good evening. In tonight's top story, the son of famed Starfleet Captain James T. Kirk has been killed by Klingons. This was after the Klingons discovered that the Federation was secretly constructing weapons of mass destruction. And this only after a genetically engineered Human from the 20th century stole the weapon using a stolen Federation starship. Further, Starfleet Captain Spock was killed only to be later resurrected by this weapon and a secret ceremony held on Vulcan. More details at 11. And tomorrow we'll discuss how two humped-back whales from the 20th are doing here after Starfleet uses time travel to retrieve them.""

startrek,"When I watch a Next Generation episode, and it makes me want to put my head through the screen, I don't get anything out of the episode.  TNG typically revolves around a plot or the story being told while DS9 was written around the character's development.  This means even in the misses like ""Move Along Home,"" you may not enjoy the plot, but you explore the characters and learn more about them.  For example, you see Quark's greediness and willingness to rip off the Watti, but you also learn he has a conscious.  You also get to see every senior officer's reaction to being put in an unfamiliar situation.  Kira tries to bluster her way through, Dax is intrigued and approaches with a scientific mindset, Sisko is calm and methodical, Bashir is willing to take a backseat as they don't need his expertise while also offering advice occasionally, and Odo is unsure how to act because it is one of the few times he can't do anything to help.  Overall, I think the character-driven plots in DS9 can help make up for stupid or poorly executed ideas in a way TNG can't.  Thoughts?",The difference between bad DS9 episodes and TNG episodes is that the DS9 episodes are largely watchable.
startrek,"A thought’s been rolling around my brain for a while - could the D- series designations be classifications not classes?

The TOS D-7 and K’t’inga are effectively identical. And there’s the D-7 (Sech-class) prison ship Lorca was on.

Could D-7, instead, designate battlecruiser, like how the 1701 is a heavy cruiser?

And the Duras sisters’ bird-of-prey being D-12 could indicate “heavy attack ship”. Worf cited it as a D-12 because the whole classification of D-12 BOPs were retired - they had only been retired since the late 2340s/early 2350s, so they were a recent-ish design of BOP.

Maybe the classic B’Rel’s were, say, D-10 (“light attack ship”), for example.

startrek,"I never really watched Enterprise much when it was on the air because I was kind of Trekked out at that point and the notion of a prequel just didn’t turn me on. But I’m watching it on Netflix not and I really like the show a lot more than I remember. When it came out I wasn’t particularly thrilled mainly because I love worldbuilding episodes that push the limits with new tech like trans warp and strange new species. But it’s just a damn good show and I feel like a jerk for not giving it enough of a chance when I was younger. 

First off, it has one of the most likable crews of any Star Trek. Scott Bakula is one of my favorite TV sci fi actors (ho boy!) and makes a very convincing captain I would be as honored to serve under as JLP (the best captain ever period, unlike that reckless retard Kirk). But the whole crew has great chemistry on par with TNG yet they also have this emotion, inexperience and human-ness that really captures the first swim in ocean feel of the show compared with the TNG crew, who always feel like minor gods who always do the right thing. It’s also just something fresh to see humanity so weak and vulnerable in a world where I’m used to seeing them as one of the most dominant species of the alpha quadrant. Plus, the Vulcans are my favorite species and this show has them in spades, as condescending and logical as ever. Oh, and the show intro gives me tingles every time I see it. 

Just saying, people seem to look at it as the failed Star Trek series because it only lasted 4 seasons, but I think the quality is better than Voyager or DS9 (not to knock those shows, Voyager was actually the series that got me into Star Trek and I think its concept is fantastic). It really reminds me why I like Star Trek so much in the first place. It’s just a world I would love to exist in, full of philosophy and ideas and supremely nerdy wonderfulness. And it turns out you can expand the world building in interesting ways with a prequel by explaining all kinds of origin stuff.",CMV: Enterprise was one of the best Star Trek series.
startrek,"\- First off, I think I appreciate it a lot more than I did in the past.  Folks have been posting about how ""its not really that bad"" and its true.  I think what threw me off as a kid when it aired, is that it tackled topics I wasn't interested in at the time. 

\- Also, I was guilty of following the first rule of new Trek shows: Hate it because its not like the Trek show you are nostalgic for.

\- I used to tell people to start at Season 3, then watch the first two after you finish the last season- but now I don't know.

\- I like playing this game in Trek, I like to note the lengths the writers go through to make sure extras and other characters never speak.  In DS9 we all know of Morn (WHO LAUGHED!) - but in Episode 14, ""Progress,"" there are two side characters who can't speak because ""the Cardassians saw to that"".  Clever.

startrek,"A couple of days ago I made a post on here, asking people how I should approach watching Star Trek for the first time and what series to start with. Most people recommended either TNG or TOS, and since I'm a purist about watching it in order of publication with Star Wars myself, I decided to start with TOS. I just finished the first season and I thought I'd update you all and tell you how I feel about Star Trek now.

During the first couple of episodes I honestly had problems really getting into it, one of my biggest problems was the gender roles. Of course I know that from the perspective of a person from the 60s it was incredibly progressive, but today episodes like ""Mudd's Women"" just feel very... outdated. I still don't really like the way that emotions are portrayed in men vs. women: like in ""Shore Leave"", when McCoy died and Kirk just looked sort of... disappointed while McCoy's fling who he barely even really knew started crying very dramatically. Please just let your male characters show emotion, they're just not relatable otherwise. Ironically, one example where I think this is done really well is Spock. There's a reasonable explanation for why he doesn't show emotions, but we're still told pretty subtly that he has emotions that he represses along with his human side. I think a lot of it is down to Leonard Nimoy's acting, he manages to portray perfectly the normal stoic Spock, but also very subtle emotional changes during high-stakes scenes (particularly when Kirk is in danger). Also very ironically, I'm prdtty sure he's the only recurring male character who's cried onscreen.

After a few episodes, I actually decided to only watch the best episodes of the show and then move on to TNG, so I watched ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" which actually managed to change my entire view on TOS. I loved the premise, the character development and the interesting moral dilemma (the idea of Edith being right but at the wrong time, causing the Nazis to win was fascinating). The comedy in that episode also played a huge role in getting me into the show, the dynamic between Kirk, Spock &amp; Bones is amazing and literally funnier than most comedy shows on TV nowadays. 

That episode basically singlehandedly converted me and I decided to watch all of TOS after all and I have to say, I absolutely get why people are obsessed with Star Trek. Just the idea of a peaceful future without racism where we explore the universe brings happy tears to my eyes, and that idea must have been especially impactful in the 60s. I love all of the characters (can we talk about how amazing Uhura is?), but my favourite is definitely Spock. Just the idea of him having been raised to repress his human side and struggling to find his identity is amazing. I love how, even though he tries so hard to be completely Vulcan, he clearly has so many human characteristics even if they're a little toned down, and I love that even though he appears to think of humanity as inferior, ultimately he still made the choice to join the Starfleet and be surrounded by humans instead of staying on Vulcan. His friendship with Kirk is amazing, I feel like Kirk is really the only one who fully accepts both his Human and his Vulcan side. It took me a while to start to like Kirk because he just seemed to much like the stereotypical cocky male hero, but I learned to appreciate him through his relationships with Spock and McCoy and his strong moral compass.

Of course it's a very old show and it's always very obvious they're just in a studio and not actually on an alien planet, and the fighting is clunky to say the least (it literally just looks like a weird hug sometimes, and other times Kirk just hits someone with his hand and they're unconscious, what the hell?), but the ideas and messages behind it are so well articulated and still relevant that the bad special effects barely matter anymore. I absolutely understand people's love for this show now. Star Wars feels like a magical fairytale in a far away world, but the people in Star Trek are from our own future which connects it to the viewer beautifully. I love the idea that my great great great grandkids could work on a spaceship like the Enterprise.

Anyway, thanks for reading this! I appreciate it! :)",Update: Watching Star Trek for the first time
startrek,"Just finished Star Trek TNG for the first time. It was the first Star Trek series I watched, besides Discovery, due to having the prejudice that old Star Trek series were only made for hardcore nerds.

After becoming intrigued, I gave it a go and found myself hooked and inspired by nearly every episode. The series was so far ahead of it's time, I still feel it is and it may always be. Season 7 was not as good as the others but damn, I still enjoyed every single episode. I can only imagine what a gutting feeling it must have been watching the credits of that final episode, not knowing if you would ever again see anything like that. Luckily I know now that there is a lot of similar content available, but the pain is still very real. In a moment of overwhelming grief, I even stood up and saluted Captain Picard as the final credits rolled, for nobody to see in my empty apartment. 

Go ahead laugh at me, I don't give a f***.

I wonder if any of the later series will be on the same level as this masterpiece, which I now regard as one of the top 5 series I ever saw, coming second to only The Sopranos. It is applaudable how it held up against time and how it's fascination is completely independent of the old special effects. Actually I even think it might have had an impact on me deciding to go back to school to do my PhD next Semester.

I'm sure I was not the only one reacting in that manner at the end and so I'd like to invite you to share how you experienced the ending. Maybe it will make me feel a little less crazy.",The New Generation ending
startrek,"Due process was pretty lacking. Kirk did not have time to build a defense and was asked to give a statement on the fly, with the entire academy present. It was only by sheer luck that the Nero crisis delayed the hearing.

I feel like the Starfleet after the timeline changed was quite different from the prime Starfleet. A good juxtaposition is the TNG episode First Duty, where the training accident was given a very procedural hearing. The cadets could actually plan their defense and the damning cross-examination was given only after the cadets had their full opportunity to present their case.",Did anyone else (besides Kirk) have a problem with the SURPRISE hearing on academic misconduct with the entire Academy students and administration present?
startrek,"Or something to that effect.

Quite literally every single day on this sub there's multiple posts where someone mentions PIC, VOY, or DIS in passing and someone immediately has to latch on and try to start a flamewar by ignoring the flow of the conversation and instead going with ""actually this thing you like is dogshit"" or ""actually *you're* dogshit for not liking this thing"". It's honestly just irritating at this point; if a thread is clearly for critiquing a show, nobody needs to show up to defend it. If a thread is for celebrating a show, nobody needs to piss on the parade.

I can pretty easily provide dozens of examples of this but I'm pretty sure everyone's seen it. It's only gotten worse in the wake of Picard S1 and it's downright tiring. At this point it feels like two-bit trolling.",Request for the mods: could we try out a rule against randomly bringing up why you hate or love a series in a thread about people doing the opposite just to be inflammatory?
startrek,"For this post, I'm going to focus on a few of the things I liked about St Picard.

First of all, the Enterprise-D in the opening scene of the first episode. Wow. It looks EXACTLY the SAME as it did! Not a single difference. No silly stupid unneccessary upgrading of the looks or the technology. It's like they respected the continuity or something. Amazing. I couldn't believe it. I was in awe that they stayed faithful. It was surreal. See Paramount/CBS? That wasn't so difficult now was it?

Not to mention the TNG uniforms and comm badges. Damn, I was losing my shit when I saw how they stayed the same too. And in the season finale when Picard met Data in the quantum memory bank or whatever and Data was wearing the exact same clothes he was wearing when he died in Nemesis. It's like the series is a faithful sequel or something. Unbelievable.

And the new Starfleet comm badges. That wasn't their first appearance by the way. They appeared in DS9's ""The Visitor"" in the future when Jake was trying to save Ben Sisko from the dimension he got stuck in or whatever. So ST Picard stayed faithful in that respect too.

While this first season wasn't the greatest Star Trek series, the continuity and consistency with established canon was such a relief and bodes well for the future. Forgive me for ranting but Star Trek has been seriously pissing me the fuck off since 2009 with all these pretentious unneccessary juvenile changes and retcons.

Rant over. Phew. I'll get back to work now.",What I love about Star Trek Picard: the continuity
startrek,"This might upset some people but it also upsets me. Let's apply this to the real world.

The Cardassian Union was like the German Democratic Republic, and the Obsidian Order were like the Stazi. Garak being a former officer of the Order tortured many people, including innocents, and may have even killed several people.

And just like the reunified Germany, the new Cardassia, in its efforts to reform itself and exorcise the ghosts of its past, will want to hold members of the former regime to account for their crimes. No democratic reform is complete without achieving justice for the victims and casualties of the previous oppressive regime.

There are many other real world examples of this.

I'm afraid many of Garak's surviving victims, their relatives and relatives of deceased victims wouldn't be happy at all about a former Obsidian Order officer working in the new civilian government trying to rebuild Cardassia. It would leave a bitter taste in their mouths and would tarnish Cardassia's efforts to turn a new page for itself.

Garak's redemption at the end of DS9 would not be complete without him owning up to his past crimes and turning himself in, pleading guilty, confessing all the heinous things he did and revealing the names and identities of other operatives, as well as other figures of the former regime, so that they could be brought to justice too.

Who agrees? And who disagrees but can explain this away or justify it?",Garak would be arrested in a post-war democractically reforming Cardassia
startrek,"So i've just watched the episode. We'll call John de Lanci Q, and Gerrit Graham Quinn.

Quinn is seeking asylum to the federation from the continuum. The hearing essentially gets framed around the idea of granting him asylum and thus enabling his suicide, or refusing to aid him and send him back to prison.

Now, i'm just getting off the end of Picard and The Good Place, so i immediately think, he should be allowed to die. And immortal life is not living. The beauty of life is that it has an end.

Q's tactics for arguing against asylum are interesting though. First he points out that no one in the continuum has ever done it, so they can't be sure of the consequences. And i think that is very telling and foreshadowing of the status of the continuum. Quinn is not allowed to kill himself because no one has done it. Because they never do anything new. They are immortal and have all of time to do what they want, so they do nothing. They are a completely stagnant society.

Q later brings up the notion that Quinn shouldn't be allowed to kill himself because he's had such a great impact on the universe. That is an interesting angle, because his life in the past was important and influential, he must be forced to live and possibly do more great and important things. It is the same argument as saying that someone who's lived an unremarkable life should be allowed to kill themselves. It is an interesting way of quantifying the worth of a human life, and who has freedom over their own choices and who doesn't.

I am not sure i agree with Q's argument. I think Quinn should have absolutely been allowed from the start to have the choice to kill himself. I realize that is how the episode ends. But i think it should have been a celebration. The captain should not look at it as aiding someone do harm, but rather share in someone's ability to live their life to the fullest.","VOY ""Death Wish"""
startrek,"In the midst of DS9 rewatch; a terrific show on most points.

This episode involves Worf, Dax, and Kor recovering the lost sword of the ancient hero Kahless from a Hur’q ruin. All fine. There’s some Klingon mysticism, a battle, there’s even a Lethian mind taker. 

After the whole adventure, they proceed to chuck the sacred and irreplaceable Batleth out of the shuttle? A few scenes earlier Worf and Kor were worshiping the thing. It seems like an incredibly irresponsible and sacrilegious thing to do. 

The justification is that when the Empire needs it, someone’s going to discover it. But that ignores hazards like micro-meteorites and just plain losing the trail. It’s not like Worf and Kor left any clues. Hell, it’d have been better if the put it back in the Hur’q museum where they got it, or if the other Klingon party was successful in stealing it.

startrek,"New trek is great television. There is no denying it’s capacity to entertain. Some of us however I think, and I may be wrong, found something more in trek. Hope, that we are enough, and our faults can be overcome, Inspiration. I think there is a reason why broken people, who feel cast aside by society find so much joy in it. Why we nerds, and geeks, and outsiders become so attached. Trek used to be an escape that we could go to, a haven where everyone despite their differences and short comings could come together and solve a problem every week. That ride gave us so much hope. It made me feel that there was beauty in the world, and if it i couldn’t find the beauty I could see the potential. At least this is what drew me to it, and why it’s precious to me. New trek is great television. It just doesn’t make me feel that potential hope for the future. Sure TNG, and voyager, and even DS9 can be in your face with its sentimentality and sappiness. But when the world sucks that’s where I go. Because old trek is like medicine. New trek just doesn’t do that. It’s good television. But just like some books change your life and others are great fun, there’s a difference. I need those Picard speeches sometimes. I relate to data’s struggle because I know what it’s like to be on the outside trying desperately to be on the inside. I feel Geordie being awkward with awkward and unsuccessful with dating. And watching them take in stride, with optimism, and hope, the crew always being there for each other. Sometimes it helps me to take my problems with optimism as well. Is it sappy, and preachy yeah. But so is Christmas. I don’t want a new darker Christmas just because the world got a little darker in the past couple years. In This same way, I don’t want a darker trek. Trek is often times my light when the world is dark. That’s why I love it. It puts a smile on face every time I here the whoosh of the enterprise in the opening credits. 

I don’t hate the new shows, I just don’t get that medicine from them, and when I watch trek, that’s what I want. Just a drunk thought on the new vs old trek debate whilst quarantined and hanging out with some friends on the enterprise.",A thought on the division of new and old trek.

startrek,"Long time lurker here, but never posted - I'm old enough to have seen this episode at first airing, and then subsequently over the years.  Each time I saw it anew, something really nagged at me about this otherwise great episode.

Unless I've made some poor reasoning here, I would have to believe that an intact and functional space vessel from the 20th Century, never mind *actual living humans* from 20th Century Earth, would be a pretty incredible discovery in the 24th Century.  Yet from the beginning, Riker and later Picard seemed annoyed having these people around - in fact, Riker had to be persuaded to even let them come aboard the Enterprise, and Picard seemed annoyed that Crusher brought them back from the dead.  Later, everyone warms to them a little, but it never seems like anyone is astounded by the rarity of this discovery.  

I've always felt like this was the show's writers expressing a sort of contempt for their own 20th Century contemporaries, an understandable bit of prejudice - but also very sloppy and indulgent to let those feelings manifest in the writing in a way that doesn't seem plausible.  Picard especially, as an archaeologist and historian, would surely have been (correctly) thrilled by this discovery.

That the Enterprise was involved in an unpleasant mission featuring the Romulans doesn't fully explain away the initial resistance to bringing the people aboard or studying their vessel, or Picard's out-of-character reaction to the discovery.

startrek,"Hi everyone,

Sorry for asking what is probably a pretty common question. I have failed to find an exactly satisfactory question/answer for this unfortunately, so I have come for help. Myself and a few friends have been doing a virtual movie club where we rotate who chooses the next movie to watch and discuss. We have been checking off some classics, and since our last movie (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) ended up being a hit, I thought it would be fun to dive into some Star Trek since none of us are familiar with it, but generally know of its importance.

I have determined that Wrath of Khan should be watchable for us, even without having seen any Star Trek before. However I have seen some opinions that WoK is made better by having familiarity with the show and the relationships between some of the characters, particularly between Kirk and Spock. I also know that the movie spawns from an episode in the original series. In order to offer a fuller effect (I know it won't be the same as watching the entire series), I want to recommend just a few *optional* episodes of ToS to the group for interested folks to become a bit more familiar with the show and its characters. 

Can you help me to choose just three or four strong episodes that could be a good introduction to the crew and serve as a primer for knowing the relationship between Kirk and Spock better? That is the main thing, I guess - if there are key episodes that flesh out important characters in the movie, I think those might be the best crash course in Star Trek to hopefully find more enjoyment in WoK.

&amp;#x200B;

 I just watched the Space Seed episode to see the introduction of Khan, and actually enjoyed it much more than I expected (maybe I'll become a big fan through all of this), and I think I might include that one on my list even though it doesn't do anything major with the Enterprise characters. Even with just that one episode I got some sense of the weirdness of Spok's lack of emotions, the small annoyance that the doctor feels at Spok for being that way, and the sly cunning of Kirk. I bet that some particular episodes could highlight that stuff even better though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!","It is my turn to choose for quarantine movie club, and I am picking Star Trek II: WoK. What few episodes should I recommend as ""optional viewing""?"
startrek,"What will your new Trek series look like? What will it be about? When will it be set? Who are your actors and characters? What themes would you want to cover? Be as brief or as detailed as you like.

My series would start in the year 2400 with a new Enterprise-F (not going to consider ST Online canon, sorry), with a new captain and a new crew going off on new voyages to explore uncharted space in the Milky Way galaxy.

I want it set in 2400 because I want the new-ish feel of the ""25th century"" and I'd also want the door open for characters from previous series to make an appearance or even become main characters. I'd like the opportunity for appearances by Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov too. Don't humans live to 200 years on average in the Federation?

I'd also want white anglo actors to be a minority in the main cast. I'd hold casting calls in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia so the Enterprise, Starfleet, and the Federation have a truly international feel to them. I think this would grow Star Trek's global appeal and be much more accurate in how an actual Starfleet would look. A minority of Earth's population are white and come from the USA/UK so it only makes sense.

Oh and the Enterprise will be a completely new kind of ship. Completely sustainable and carbon neutral equipped with regenerative crystals that are recharged by the most abundant energy source in the galaxy: stars. Everyone once in a while, the Enterprise will just have to make a pit stop by a star to recharge. The entire exterior can absorb solar energy.

Themes to explore:

Mental health (depression, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, PTSD). The Dominion War is still fresh in the memory of many Starfleet personnel.  
Refugees and immigration (Starfleet and the Enterprise are home to many Cardassian, Romulan, and Klingon refugees fleeing war, poverty, and persecution and now building new lives for themselves. Would create for interesting drama and social commentary).  
The need for Starfleet to continue its peaceful mission of exploration but to also remain vigilant and ready for combat so that the Dominion War never happens again, especially now that there's a power vacuum in Romulan space. The new Enterprise-F is armed to the teeth and even houses an on-board barracks for an entire regiment of Starfleet infantry. Lots of ethical issues to explore there.  
Gender and sexuality (masculinity would be interesting to explore).  
Privilege and inequality

startrek,"Or rather, why is everyone in the universe so stupid that they take the idea Vulcan's can't lie as admissible in court? You hear this every episode where a Vulcan has more than five lines, but in the same episode there will almost always be a little side-joke where that same Vulcan bends the truth. Spock is famous for this.

A more truthful statement might be ""Vulcans **don't** lie,"" not ""Vulcan's *can't* lie."" Vulcans don't lie (often) because it is, in their assessment, illogical. Vulcans aren't logical by nature, and their logic is in fact the result of centuries of defiance of their baser natures. They can therefore lie just as easily as they can be illogical, which they also tend to do with some regularity.

Tuvok points out to Chakotay in an early episode of Voyager that he was able to lie about being a Maquis because he was ""honest to {his} own convictions within the defined parameters of {his} mission."" This seems to indicate that he could compartmentalize his mind, essentially lying to himself and making the lie true. If he can do that, any Vulcan with a third-grade logic certificate could probably also do the same, effectively making it so the truth is ANY Vulcan could be lying to you at ANY time about ANY thing, or possibly EVERY Vulcan EVERY time about EVERYTHING.

In theory, the Vulcans could all be insane.

So why would there be a slow time of day? I can understand some things being on a cycle that is open at certain times of day, like Keiko's school, but wouldn't Quark's bar have people coming and going all time?",DS9: Why is there a slow time of day?
startrek,"Starfleet built the Defiant to explore strange new worlds, discover the unknown, and advance the cause of peace and learning in the galaxy. 

Instead her crew were lured into interphasic space by the Tholians, went insane, murdered each other, and then the Defiant was captured by the Terran Empire a hundred years in the past. 

From there the Terrans, weeks away from losing a war with a group of allied species resembling the Federation, ended up crushing their enemies with her future technology and established total dominance for over a century with overwhelming technological superiority. 

This is a disaster that I don't think gets emphasized enough. Billions of people across the mirror Alpha Quadrant were oppressed for generations because of the edge the Defiant gave the Terrans. Entire worlds were devastated throughout multiple Terran genocides. What happened with the Defiant goes far beyond anything Starfleet could have imagined as a worst case scenario when her crew first set off on its 5 year mission, and it's arguably the worst fate any Starfleet vessel suffered in this entire franchise.",The TOS Defiant is the most underrated disaster in Starfleet history.
startrek,"Does anyone else rationalize that the in-universe explanation for the on-screen visual reboot of the TOS era (Aside from the real world reasoning that the cheap aesthetic of the TOS era doesn’t work anymore) 
is the result of time travel throughout the franchise affecting the Prime Timeline, 
particularly from the crew of the Enterprise E and the Borg Sphere going back to 2063 in First Contact.

It’s also possible that Archer’s NX-01 Enterprise wasn’t part of the Prime Timeline’s history until Star Trek: First Contact altered it.
Cochrane’s knowledge of the Enterprise E could’ve contributed to the existence of the NX-01 in the timeline.

There’s also small things like Scotty giving away the formula for translucent aluminum in The Voyage Home, Data leaving his device in 1893, and etc that might’ve caused the prime timeline to advance earlier, delay the Eugenics War/ WWIII, make Khan a white British dude, and etc.

Star Trek has so many different time travel mechanics, but the one I’m referring to here with the Prime Timeline alterations is some version of the Back to the Future mechanics.",In-Universe Explanation for the Visual Retcon of the TOS era
startrek,"In the episode where the crew meets Sela, Guinan, referring back to “Yesterday’s Enterprise,” says that she knows Tasha somehow went back in time onto the Enterprise C. She says that if Picard allowed that, then what’s happening now is his fault. However, Tasha begged Picard to send her to the Enterprise C after Guinan told her that the natural timeline resulted in Tasha’s meaningless death. Guinan didn’t need to tell her that. She could have just stopped at saying “You should be dead, but I don’t know why.” Or even be more vague and say “You’re not supposed to be on the Enterprise.” For as smart as Guinan is, I feel like she handled that situation poorly, and her comments are what led to Tasha insisting on a different path for herself.

startrek,"I’m sure there’s at least one more episode with Eddington where he escapes again or something because this ended a bit too...easily, not dramatic enough for the relationship they have so I just want to gauge the feelings on his actions up until this point in time. 

Now I will say Sisko is definitely obsessed with Eddington, at first mostly just because Eddington got the upper hand and got away with it. Eddington 100% betrayed Starfleet and used his position to help out the Maquis and give false info on them to Sisko, or false enough to fool everyone without raising suspicions. At first before this particular episode I was kinda with Eddington in regards to Sisko that they hadn’t done anything too terrible that concerned the Federation and Siskos need to catch him wasn’t a huge priority. Fortunately the episodes were spread out far enough that when Eddington did pop up it was likely months in between where other things have happened so it made sense. 

However while I don’t condone what Sisko did in torpedoing the planet I do agree with his argument that the Maquis made themselves a bigger target when they got and used biogenic weapons. And successfully attacked an Excelsior class starship. I don’t think Starfleet would have agreed with the end product but I do think they would have increased patrols and ships near the DMZ to track down the Maquis. 

I honestly don’t know where I go with feelings. I agree with the argument but the action seems too ruthless, and Sisko didn’t care if the people were evacuating or not so he fully intended on killing those people just to get to Eddington. Does the ends justify the means? Lend me your opinions and feelings. Not looking to make up my mind or anything I just want to see where you feel with it.","Feelings on Sisko regarding Eddington, up until episode “For the Uniform” SPOILERS for anyone not there yet"

startrek,"So I just started watching Star Trek: Enterprise again. I've always been into Star Trek, but I always had a hard time getting into Enterprise. Honestly, for the longest time, it was my least favorite series. The 1st and 2nd seasons had a few good episodes here and there, but I really lost interest when the 3rd season was on the air (mostly because it was the days of before I had DVR). I kept trying to get through it over the last 16 years. With the coronavirus pandemic, I've had a lot of extra time to watch it. I finished Season 3 (which I thought was very well done for the most part), and I just finished watching the 3-episode Syrrannite arc (The Forge/Awakening/Kir'Shara). That arc was SUPER good.   


It depresses me that the dead UPN channel and the lack of audience contributed to the cancellation of Enterprise. I wish that it been given a second life like DS9 did.   


What are your thoughts?",Why Did Enterprise Have to Be Cancelled?!?!
startrek,"Writing this as I rewatch key episodes (mostly those where crewman Cutler is involved), so this might be incomplete. Right now I’m watching Episode 13 Sleeping Dogs. 

The scenes wherein Lt. Reed’s cold reminds me of our current pandemic reality. I think the one that takes the blow is the episode prior to this—Season 1 Episode 12 Dear Doctor. 

Dear Doctor presents a medical drama about misguided compassion and universe natural course, narratively tied by the conversations between two medical professionals. 

Aside from the widely discussed ethical dilemna on the hypocratic oath and natural selection, which will become the guiding foundations of THE (prime) directive. I think the episodes become more relevant given our current predicament and the ethical choices the global community is facing.

One controversial and ethical dilemna would be on the topic of ‘Herd Immunity’ going about mostly in the western hemisphere. The logic of this is simple, let nature takes it course and those who are ‘fit’ would develop natural immunities.

I do not agree to this logic. I believe there is a far better option for us and it start not by demarcating the ‘new normal’ (like social distancing and paronia level approaches) but by abolishing the old and restructing society to become more humane and sufficient. 

In this example we are the Valakians. A dominant species bent on controlling nature. But nature is not meant to be controlled and exploited. Same with the sentiments of crewman Cutler, we should find the old ways—consumerism,exploitation, wars and the like—distateful and we should set forth the ideal for a more humane and ecological. 

The virus may be nature’s design but we can surpass this if we live by the land and let ourselves learn from nature.

Unlike the Valakians there is hope for us,afterall, this disease is not genetic but more viral. Our species is not doomed but we must all cooperate for the betterment of all. There will be no warp capable starships bringing salvation but there is hope among ourselves to surpass this challenge. 

(Well this is just my reflection of the episode, hopefully everyone should start giving the series a chance).

startrek,"I personally like them. Their much more alien-like appearance and non-human facial features sells their alien origins much better than ""classic Klingons"" ever did. I also appreciate their much more pronounced hierarchical social order, as well as the much more brutal tactics they employ against their enemies, such as torturing them and even eating slain Starfleet captains. Klingons in older treks merely implied they were capable of  brutalities in the furtherance of Klingon interests and in preservation of their honor, but rarely followed through on their intentions. They usually just growled or protested verbally when they were insulted.

To put it succinctly, I think Discovery era Klingons are less talk and much more action. They stay true to their brutal culture and don't hesitate to employ vicious fear tactics against their enemies and amongst themselves. It's a much less romanticized depiction of Klingon culture, and I think it's an interesting and valuable perspective on the species.

I'm curious, what do you guys think?",What is your opinion on Klingons in Star Trek Discovery?
startrek,"It's not like there haven't been *any*, but they're few and far between. There's *Voyager: Elite Force*, and there were a couple good strategy games decades ago, and *Star Trek Online* certainly has a lot of good content, but overall there is just a massive lack of any good games in one of the biggest franchises of all time. *Especially* in the strategy department. Star Trek is the *perfect* setting for a whole host of strategy/management games. The closest we've come to the proper AAA *Star Trek* games we deserve is probably the two fan-made overhaul mods *Star Trek: Armada III* (for *Sins of a Solar Empire*) and *Star Trek: New Horizons* (for *Stellaris*), both of which are fantastic and totally prove the potential for a *Star Trek* 4X grand strategy or a fleet-commanding RTS.

Just a few of the genres where *Star Trek* would be awesome:

\- Paradox-style grand strategy 4X (as demonstrated by *New Horizons*

\- Fleet battle RTS (like in *Armada III*), perhaps with a turn-based campaign map like the *Total War* games

\- Space rts/roguelike (like *FTL: Faster Than Light*)

\- *XCOM*-style turn-based tactical combat with a strategy layer (where *XCOM*'s geoscape is instead a galaxy map to traverse with your starship and the combat is away missions)

\- Narrative games with multiple paths affected by player choices (like the old episodic Telltale games, or the *Mass Effect* series)

\- A management/development game where you take command of a space station in a remote, dangerous area and try to run and improve it. This isn't exactly a genre, but I'm imagining it taking hints from Rimworld where each new game begins with a random cast of characters with randomly-generated strengths, weaknesses, traits, and backgrounds, and the story progresses by throwing random events and challenges at you according to a ""storytelling algorithm.""",Why is there such a dirth of good Star Trek video games?
startrek,"The scores of some of the TOS movies sometimes made them, and sometimes there were better than movies themselves. Some truly inspirational work from of the composers. Such a shame James Horner didn't become to Star Trek what John Williams is to Star Wars. May he rest in peace.

So instead of ranking the TOS movies by how much you liked them overall, I propose a different ranking based on their scores alone. I believe you might find both those lists quite different. Mine is. Feel free to include the TNG movies if you want. I didn't because I haven't binged them enough to really connect with their scores to include them in my list fairly.

1. The Search for Spock (I love this movie. It's in my top 3 favourite TOS movies but I still think it's score was better than the movie itself. I know James Horner used 90% of the work he did on WOK but the new music he added for TSFS was excellent.)
2. The Wrath of Khan (Simply epic. No need for further comment.)
3. The Undiscovered Country

startrek,"So I just finished Season 2 last night and I'll admit that the last episode (both parts) were a big improvement on the season as a whole. But I don't understand &gt;!the idea of having Discovery simply be marked down as classified and that's the end of it. Their were a lot people at that battle. Klingons, Ba'ul and Kelpiens (who have suddnely joined forces and latter has learned how to pilot starfighters?) And everyone is going to go along with Starfleet's request Discovery wasn't destroyed at the battle. No. It just never existed. Meaning the battle never took place. !&lt;

&gt;!This means that the Klingons that died at the battle did not die an honorable death? And what of the Kelpiens? The most significant event in their planet's history is a direct result of Discovery.!&lt; This just seems like really poor or lazy writing and something that has pulled me out of the story throughout the whole season.

startrek,"The whining ""new Trek sucks"" crowd has got me thinking about something. **How would you rank the shows based solely on their first 10 episodes?** This is the number of PIC episodes, so it seems fair. And try to think about this as objectively as possible without nostalgia and its rose-colored glasses tainting your ranking. Try to think about just these episodes. That's difficult but try. Why bother? Well, I grew up with TOS reruns in the 70s and 80s then the movies. I remember in 87 &amp; 88 when people had the same complaints about TNG then DS9 when it came out. Now they are the most loved shows it seems. I will also say they are my two favorites. Anyway here's mine as objectively as I can muster (I didn't include TAS solely because I haven't rewatched it in a very long time and can't make an honest assessment):

1. TOS
2. ENT
3. Short Treks (hard to rank because of the anthology aspect of the show and the length of episodes but it does have 10 and some are darn good)
4. DISCO
5. PIC
6. VOY
7. DS9
8. TNG

So there you go, first ten episodes only. Refresh your memory of those episodes by going to Amazon or Memory Alpha or where ever you need to go. Rewatch ""Code of Honor"" if you need to. And only rank them if you have seen all ten episodes of the show. If you are someone who has only watched the greatest hits of a show, don't rank it. Be as honest and as objective as you can.

startrek,"It’s been a couple weeks since I watched Disco so I don’t have complete memory of how exactly the sequence of events happened but did the Sphere pull Discovery out of warp or was there a distortion like at the asteroid and Kaminar that led them to the Sphere? The rest of this is going based off the latter. 

If it’s the distortion that led them to the Sphere in the first place then I have to ask when Michael goes back in time to create the distortions wouldn’t she have been better off not leading them to it? The Sphere is the entire reason she has to go back in time as it takes over Control and turns it into a Terminator, so by not leading them to it that should save everyone. It gave some knowledge on ancient Kelpiens sure but otherwise it’s not used for much, again I’m sorry if I’m remembering wrong but I don’t remember it helping much. Yes it’s a plethora of knowledge but is that worth the cost?

That’s of course assuming the assumption it was Michael. If the Sphere itself actually pulled them in then couldn’t Michael also have tried to lead them away from it or set a distortion at some other sector at the same time Discovery was heading towards the Sphere? 
I know there’s a lot of behind the scenes things that the show runners wanted to do, I think I heard they wanted to send Disco way into the future when they got back from the mirror universe idk if that’s true or not, and of course because of Control Discovery had to go to the future to save everyone and make it make sense in terms of the show universe as a whole but still.",The Sphere in Disco.

startrek,"So after quarantine began, my dad introduced me to Star Trek in order to “complete my nerd training”. He started with TNG because he thought it would capture my attention more than TOS, however we *did* watch TOS movies. So I thought I’d share my ranking/opinions of them. I know this has probably been done a thousand times before, but I just really want to talk about it with someone and I’m new to the community. Also, again, please no spoilers! I’ve only watched TOS movies and the first season of TNG so far, so don’t spoil anything else.

So here’s my **personal** ranking of the Original Series films, from least favorite to favorite:

6. Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I feel like this movie took itself too seriously, and just didn’t have enough action. The characters also didn’t get much time to shine, and I didn’t feel like I really knew them after watching it. It still had moments, and it’s not a *bad* movie, just not my favorite.

5. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. So from other articles I’ve been reading, I think this seems to be people’s least favorite. It’s still not an incredible film, but I like a lot of things about it better than one. It’s more fun, with more action and more focus on the characters. The camping scenes were also great.

4. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. I know this movie is well-loved so don’t attack me haha. While I haven’t watched the rest of TOS, I did watch “Space Seed” to prepare for this movie. I think the idea of bringing a one-off villain back and making him the main villain seeking revenge is super cool, and the end of the movie is amazing. Though I haven’t watched the show yet, Spock’s death destroyed me. I mean, come on! It’s *Spock*! He’s iconic. I just don’t see why everyone else seems to think this movie is the best, though. Maybe I’m just missing something, idk. But I just don’t love it as much as everyone else seems to. Still a fantastic movie.

3. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. I originally couldn’t pick between this and Star Trek III, but ended up putting III above this. This movie is just so fun and action-packed! I also love the whole “who dun it” plot style. That said, I totally figured out that the rando Vulcan lady was part of the conspiracy from the get-go. It was pretty obvious that she was sus.

2. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. This movie was just really great. Emotional, entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat. I was sad to see David go so soon though. I wanted to see him and Kirk’s relationship develop. But the reunion between Spock and the rest of the crew was beautiful.

1. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. So let me preface this by saying that I have cetaphobia...fear of whales. So naturally, when I realized that the probe was trying to contact a species of animals, I turned to my dad and said, “They’re trying to contact a freaking **whale**, aren’t they?!?!” I was a little skeptical from that point on, but my dad ensured me that I would love it. He was right. I did have to cover my eyes a few times because I just can’t look at whales without feeling the need to run and hide. That said, this movie is a *masterpiece*! It was hilarious, fun, exciting, and had a great message. Seeing everyone in the 80s was a wild and funny ride. And as much as whales terrify me, I realize that my fear is irrational, and I do think they’re beautiful. So the underlying message of “Save the whales!” is a very welcome one. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Maybe my *absolute* favorite movie of all time. It’s just great.

I'm talking, anyway, about Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan in Into Darkness. It was a little controversial at the time, understandably, for whitewashing the character, and originally JJ Abrams had wanted to cast Benicio Del Toro in the role.

startrek,"I don't know how many times the TNG era writers painted an agrarian society as idyllic. 

In Devil's Due, the Enterprise visits the Ventaxians who have an ""idyllic agrarian"" society that gave up technology and are better for it (I don't know how they have advanced structures and lighting. Maybe they power their lights with beets or something). 

Sisko and O'Brien crash land on a planet where technology doesn't work and while the episode does portray the societies leader as a bit of an unhinged fanatic, the villagers appreciate the hard won agrarian lifestyle they built for themselves and are considering staying even when the truth comes out and they're able to leave. 

Another DS9 episode the crew crash lands on a planet of their descendants from the crash on the same planet, sure enough their lifestyle is a happy agrarian one (aside from a small faction of ""Klingons"" who live as Hunter-gatherers). 

In Star Trek Insurrection the Baku are yet another advanced species that gave up technology for an agrarian lifestyle that was deemed superior.

Eddington, ever the hipster brags about how the Masquis grow their own food and how much better it tastes than replicated food which sounds less and less appealing as the TNG era winds down. (But still better than Neelix's cooking). 

Supposedly a lot of this is attributed to Michael Piller. But I guess it serves as a reminder that it isn't just the current era's writers that don't get Trek. The series has a history of writers injecting stupid personally held ideas.",So were the TNG era writers Amish or something?
startrek,"I am in the process of my first complete watch of all Star Trek, in order of show release, but I've hit a wall with next gen. There are only 5 episodes left in season six, but I just can't muster enthusiasm. The crew and show seem to have completely lost their edge. 
  Captain Jellico showed Riker to be a shell of the officer he used to be, lately he feels more like a host at a fancy restaurant, than a competent number one.  Picard, while still an able diplomat, just doesn't seem to have the right stuff. The enterprise feels more like the love boat, when it should be pride of the fleet. I just want someone to show some drive or ambition, some passion or rage. The entire crew just seems to be going though the motions. 
  I find myself daydreaming about how good the show could be. If Captain Jellico had stayed on as Captain, and Picard had retired from the fleet, but stayed on as a civilian, we could have had real conflict. Jellico, answerable to the Admiralty, and Picard, as a civilian diplomat, answerable to the UFP council. Both men working for the greatest good in different sometimes competing ways.

startrek,"Just wondering if it was only me? I love the original timeline TNG, DS9, Voyager and Picard.

I just don’t ‘get’ the reboots with alternative timelines. The films try too hard to be funny and throw in action shots, the characters aren’t as memorable and the story doesn’t seem to flow well. 

I can’t stand the latest Discovery series, I tried.. I really did... but after 7 episodes of depicting the Klingons as mindless animals who require subtitles I just got sick and switched it off.

startrek,"Did anyone else feel that news interview where Picard is attacked by the presenter really forced. Picard is responsible for saving the universe and the Federation so many times it comes out of ""right"" field that he would be attacked for doing something that Federation would have done (in the past) automatically.

So here is an idea on how to fix that scene, an alternate take if you will.

What if the journalist interviewing Picard was non other than Jake Sisko, the man who's  mother was killed  in no small part thanks to Picard's Borg personality, Locutus. In this way, we have a tie into past ST lore not only in DS9 but with the whole BORG-arc. Ghosts of the past coming back to haunt him. 

AND if Jake was the journalist you could see that maybe he may be a little more hostile, even unintentionally so.

startrek,"The whole time travel paradox thing. I'm sorry to say but Avengers: Endgame got it right. If you travel back in time to meet your younger self and kill him/her, you will not begin to fade and cease to exist. If you travel across time, you travel into a different self-containing quantum reality. What happens here doesn't affect where you came from and the only way you could go back to your own quantum reality is if you were to leave a device that acted as a sort of quantum bungee cord that could sling you back.

I think starships in the late 24th/early 25th centuries should be equipped with what I think should be called ""quantum anchors"" that the ships' computers automatically release when they detect a quantum anomaly. Travelling through space, it's very likely for a starship to accidently crash into phenomena that either makes it travel through time or to parallel universes. Whenever such a phenomena is detected, the ship's computer automatically ejects a quantum anchor so the ship can easily and safely travel back to its own time/reality.

A good episode could be the Enterprise-F crashing into a parallel universe and when the crew tries to go through the standard procedures of returning, (conveniently) there's a technical problem in the ship due to damage sustained during the trip. AND, a Terran Empire ship comes across the Enterprise-F causing further delays due to obvious reasons you can think of.",The one thing about Star Trek that needs to be retconned
startrek,"I haven’t watched TOS except the mirror universe and the Tribble episodes, along with the first five episodes, and I’ve been watching through DS9 and I have to say both versions were insanely hilarious. Watched the TOS so I knew what exactly what was going on and DS9 fit perfectly, as it could of course. 

I died twice watching the DS9 version:
once when I realized Worf was talking about the Tribbles ending up in the Klingon ship at the end of TOS and the Tribbles were sworn enemies. It took me a minute to realize it but when I did I had to pause the show and laugh like a madman it was such a great call back to something that was minor at the the time and it had such a long lasting impact. 
The second when Sisko and Dax were searching through the Tribbles at the end and it fit so perfectly as to why it looked like they were being thrown out in TOS because they were! Of course in reality they were being thrown but having an in universe explanation is just as spectacular and great. 

Both episodes are so great and I love the respect DS9 had for the episode and that they just went with the insanity. I do have to ask has the Temporal Agency thing guys always been around just never mentioned or created in this episode for added absurdity? Not saying it was bad and I liked the inclusion because honestly in the Star Trek universe they absolutely need a Temporal Agency thing lol.",I can see why the Tribble story was popular
startrek,"Okay on my rewatching of all Star Trek I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the different casts. A hallmark of trek is it ensemble cast and I ranked them as I saw fit. Would love to see y’all’s rankings as well. 
1. TNG - I think every character is treated with care and given room to be fleshed out for the audience. 
2. DS9 - this could’ve easily been 1 for me. 
3. TOS - purists will be angry but outside of Kirk Spock and McCoy, no one is given good material to work with (gets better in the films)
4. Picard - small sample size but better than others. 
5. ENT - not great but characters are fleshed out better than the series below. Phlox and his interactions with the crew make it for me. 
6. Voyager- I mean, do I need to explain. Writing for characters was bad and some were not given room to grow. 
7. Discovery- doesn’t really have an ensemble cast. (Haven’t seen s2, I know pike comes but he doesn’t stay)

startrek,"If you pay attention to it; star fleet is supposed to be the naval/airforce/ army for federation. So likewise security is supposed to be the navy seals version of the federation. 
Don’t be the person who simply says- they are explorers not warriors, because yes you’re right. But even so, there is a need for competent security, and ONE important aspect of that is security when you are exploring the unknown. The only physically inclined security personnel was warf- a Klingon. The only attempt at demonstrating what I’m taking about is when enterprise was hunting dusk the Xindi and bright aboard characters who an elite spec ops team from earth. As much as exploring is the number one priority, there are too many scenes where security demonstrated extremely limited hand to have combat ability or overall strength. Watching DS9 and when Siskin is by far the strongest force hunting down the teenage Jwk has dar, and your security is 2 men, 5”8 150 pounds, clearly another huge plot hole. 

There is no difference between this and a engineer who had basic skills, but was no better than the science officer in fixing the warp core. It wouldn’t happen.

startrek,"As part of being out of work I'm watching a lot of Star Trek. I'm currently doing rewatches of TNG and Deep Space Nine, I'm leaning harder into DS9 this go around as I've never seen the entirety of the show in order and I've missed some episodes. Anyway I'm also watching TNG. I watched Lonely Among Us last night and forgot just how boring the episode is. The whole subplot with the two groups of delegates really felt unnecessary as they never really do anything with them. You never see the snake people again after they are transported over. It felt like they could have explored the whole energy being thing more thoughtfully if they dropped the delegate storyline.

Also why did nobody else notice that characters that were effected by the energy were acting strangely? There are some glances here and there that something is going on but nobody acts on it. When Crusher gets infected Troi is there and just looks at her and doesn't really do or say anything. When Crusher goes to the bridge Picard doesn't really do or say anything after she returns to normal. And he doesn't find it odd that she is on the bridge as she should be able to do most if not all of her research from sickbay. Riker and Crusher eventually noticed Picard acting oddly but at that point there have been many instances of other people acting the same way but nobody says anything prior to that. The Sherlock Holmes stuff with Data was the only thing I found enjoyable with this episode. 

With this rewatch I may just skip to the better episodes of the first and second season. I had watched The Last Outpost and Where No One Has Gone Before prior to this.

startrek,"Data is an artifically constructed being with artificial intelligence and simulated personality. His personhood on the show is recognized by the crew and later acknowledged by Starfleet in turns not without dispute. 

The Doctor, an Emergency Medical Hologram repurposed as Voyager's Chief Medical Officer, is also an artificial construct with artificial intelligence and simulated personality. His personhood is eventually acknowledged by the crew. It comes more slowly than for Data and the Federation never recognizes his personhood but does recognize his intellectual property rights in a kind of strange ruling in a late season Voyager episode. 

The above two artificial constructs that simulate human intelligence and personality to varying degrees are acknowledged as people to varying degrees. 

The holodeck is however capable of running programs that are fully interactive that feature people with simulated personalities that can even emulate real people's personalities (we saw that the Enterprise computer could simulate Dr Leah Brahms's personality with only a 7 percent margin of error based on a psych profile and some lectures she gave). 

And people treat these holographic constructs like playthings. Even in extended simulations like Fairhaven which is supposed to be a persistent simulated community that the Voyager crew develops a relationship with, Janeway has no problem editing one of the holograms to suit her preferences. She alters his physical traits and educational background to make him more desirable and deletes his wife, editing his marital status to single. I might appreciate being made more desirable but I don't think I'd go for you retconning my hypothetical wife out of existence just so you could date me. 

Whats the difference between these holographic characters and The Doctor and Data? Where is the line that separates the artificial intelligences with rights from the ones without rights? 

Clearly there is a line somewhere, I don't think, for example, when I stomp Goombas as Mario in a Super Mario game, I'm committing murder. Starfleet likewise seems to be of the opinion that Dr. Bashir is not committing murder when he runs his Julian Bashir Secret Agent programs. Nor is he committing any other offenses when he uses the female characters in the simulation for his fantasies (I have no idea how far he takes it which is why I'm being vague). 

So what do you think? Do you think there's room for fully interactive simulated people that can be used as toys or in games? Did they get that right with the holodeck?","Data, the Doctor, the Holodeck, and Personhood."

It's an opinion I've held for a long time, that the Enterprise-A should have been the Excelsior. Star Trek is about progress and change, and making the Enterprise-A in my opinion another refit-Constitution-class is against progress and change, it's just more of the same and it was a safe decision from the studio who didn't want to anger the fans, which in my opinion was a mistake, and if fans didn't like the name Excelsior, they could have just renamed her Enterprise.

The headstone has birth and death dates which I can only assume are meant to be Kirk's, but they don't seem to correspond to any dates I've found when looking for Kirk's birthday or for the Stardate that Kirk says it is in the Captains log at the end of the episode.

Every so often somebody enters the room to get Riker to come do something else and he leaves, but we never actually see him do anything else. There's an entire episode that's just him failing to play that one part of Nightbird he canonically can't play and swearing every time he screws up. Every episode takes place in a slightly different location as he tries to find somewhere he can play uninterrupted. The opening credits are set to him playing scales.

startrek,"One of my favorite aspects of The Next Generation is how well it does minor characters, and one of my most beloved is the complicated Captain Jellico from the season six two-parter, ""Chain of Command."" 

First of all, that name. Captain Jellico. Fucking rolls off the tongue as if it is the very embodiment of God's gift of language. Only the man that is Captain Jellico can carry this name, and oh boy does he carry it well. Fast walking in and out of scene, curtly delivering orders, overreacting to the most minor resistances...Captain Fucking Jellico. The guy looks like cable's eye-pleasing fill-in for Steve Buscemi, and this makes me dream of an even greater Captain Jellico that could have been, but all these elements of the non-buscemi Captain Jellico make him the absolute gift he is. 

In a sense, Captain Jellico represents the antithesis to the usual Picardian Enterprise. He enters inexplicably, taking command from Picard and replacing the more liberal, beloved, and trusted captain with the conservative, authoritarian, and private Captain Jellico. Despite going against all leadership form Picard built the show on, I can't help but love Captain Jellico. The guy knows what needs to be done and he gets it done. Say what you will about the authoritarian leader, Jellico is the guy you want when someone has to take charge. Orderly, diligent, and unwavering, Jellico is a real leader. Hell, he makes you wonder just how much off-camera time Picard was able to spend in the holodeck while everyone else figured out for themselves what the hell they should be doing. The guy even relieved Riker of command, seeing him as the superfluous bumbling buffoon he is (yeah I said it and bringing him back was a cheap plot point). 

Just how many crises could have been averted if Captain Jellico was in charge? He straight up told Picard all odds pointed to him dying and a war ensuing before he left on his ridiculous secret mission. Oh and what do you know, Picard spends all of part two getting tortured af.  Not to mention, Jordy, Riker, and other Jellico-deniers were fully aware the weight of their diplomacy mission even if they weren't aware of Picard's secret mission. Plus, if he didn't drop enough hints that there was another mission going on these guys don't deserve to be in Star Fleet. The crew should be ashamed of themselves for needing such a kick in the ass when they are in all likelihood flying into war. Jellico isn't even always a dictator, look at him, Geordie, and Data working together to save Picard's ass in part two, or him helping Picard get more recon data for his mission. The guy knows how serious space diplomacy actually is, and despite all the pickles the crew repeatedly finds themselves in, he is condemned for this concerned view. 

Finally, Captain Jellico saves the damn day, with his classic abrupt diplomacy. Yeah sure, Picard resisted his torture (except he was seconds from breaking if not for Jellico), but let's not forget about the real hero of the day. The guy just cooly takes off and nobody even thanks him!

Believe me, I could go on, but the fact of the matter is there is only one Greatest Captain of All Time, and that is Captain Fucking Jellico you sheep.",On Captain Jellico (TNG)

Immediately after her mutiny failed, a battle between Starfleet and the Klingon empire ensued.

startrek,"Good evening all! I have a rather odd question. And, seeing as I'm new to trek I thought I'd as those of you with more knowledge. So, it's my understanding that the Borg queen is a construct of the collective, a voice for them a physical form. So, by that logic when Picard was turned into Locutus, was he a borg king? Seeing as he spoke for the borg? The only thing that messed with that theory in my head is how the queen spoke to him and was ""there"" the whole time. So, I'm just curious if Picard became a borg king of sorts. And if not, what he'd be classified as in the collective. (other than a simple drone) 

Thank you all in advance! I appreciate any and all insight you can provide.","Odd question, in regards to Picard and the Borg queen."
startrek,"I recently decided to rewatch Star Trek, specifically Deep Space 9, and try to read ""between the lines"" of the story and try to find the meaning or parallel to our society (or at least society as it was at the time of the original airing).  It's been fun so far (I'm only in Season 1), but I admit I'm drawing a blank when it comes to the episode ""Captive Pursuit.""  


To recap: DS9 makes it's first First Contact with a species from the Gamma Quadrant when a ship comes through the wormhole.  O'Brien befriends the only person on the ship ,who goes simply by ""Tosk,"" as he helps him repair the ship.  It is later revealed that Tosk is the prey in a predator/prey type society when the predators come looking for him.  Threats are made, insults thrown, and in the end O'Brien helps Tosk escape to resume the ""hunt"" rather than be brought home disgraced by being captured alive. 

I'm really struggling to see the parallels here.  The closest thing that I can come up with in modern society is the ""fox hunts"" that upper-class English hold as tradition.  (I do not wish to offend anybody so if this tradition is no longer practiced please let me know).

So I figured I'd post a message here in hopes that someone else can shed light on my quandary.","Rewatching DS9, searching for parallels to today's world"
startrek,"I would like to know how others regard this episode. Here are my thoughts:

This was a really frustrating episode for me. It had a great concept and one that could potentially provoke tons of emotion, but it’s riddled with bad acting from Emerson, choppy editing, weird plot details and a virtually non existent B story about the Kir’Shara.

I never understood why Emerson didn’t just tell Archer the truth once he was aboard and then just pretend like the experiment didn’t work when he left. He and Archer were already close so he would’ve most likely had support for the experiment. 

Also the writing for Trip was off. One minute he was arguing profusely with Archer and by the end of the episode he was ok with everything without any resolve occurring on screen. Plus Phlox mentioned that Quinn was suffering from cellular disintegration so wouldn’t he not beam aboard with his body practically breaking down. 

In the previous episode Kir’Shara, T’Pau mentioned that it would take years to translate the ancient texts. Yet, a week later(as stated by Trip), they have apparently already deciphered many of the texts including a cure for Ponar syndrome.

Overall this episode had the potential to be a very thought provoking and emotional episode but it falls flat on its face due to a number of script problems. A disappointment as Season 4 of ENT is my personal favourite season out of all the shows. A 1/5 for me.",Enterprise S4 EP10 Daedalus
startrek,"It always bugs me whenever a character gets beamed up, he or she stands still for a few seconds while the beaming animation commences and you see them slowly disappear. Didn't it ever bother the writers? You write a tense situation where the characters beam away at the last moment, and then you have them standing still for 3 seconds or something. The animation also kind of looks campy in that regard.

Yet there is that episode on TNG where a planet steals all children from the Enterprise, and they do so with a transporter of their own. The animation for that is fast and crisp. They are blinked away almost instantly.",Why did they decide on having the transporter being so slow? [TNG-DS9-VOY-era]
startrek,"I want to begin by saying I think William Shatner really ""became"" Kirk in TOS cast films ranging from '79-'91.  

He's a magnetic presence, bursting with emotion, and for the most part his dialogue is expertly-written.  He's given understandable character motivation, interesting arcs, and he is the literal star of the films -- although I would say the infamous triumvirate is featured so well that each film barring TMP is a two-tiered ensemble piece.

So here's my rankings, and I'm keen to see everyone else's!

**1. The Search For Spock** - Nimoy knew how to direct The Shatner and it shows.  There's a lot of meat and scenery for Billy to chew in this.  His play-acting and then impishness during the Enterprise heist is wonderful.  And of course, his reaction to David's death, the desperation of the fight with Kruge, and reunion with Spock make for a killer third act performance.


**2. The Voyage Home** - This was in a dead heat with SFS which won for the dramatic material.  The tone of this film is a feat; the tension and stakes are there but it's such a warm, fuzzy blanket of an experience.  This is due very much to Shatner, as he gives an enchanting take on a newly-evolved Kirk.  The outtakes on YouTube show what a loose atmosphere Nimoy had set up.


**3. The Wrath of Khan** - I actually find this turn to be the odd one out.  You can tell Meyer exhausted him, but the 50th take of a technical jargon line does work better than the bravado of Captain Mid-Life Crisis (TMP).  It's a transitional Kirk, and Shat slays his scenes with Carol, David and Khan.  Not to mention his raw eulogy and poignant final words with Carol are the best writing Kirk ever had.  I am of the opinion his defeated posture laying against the pane opposite Spock is the most powerful ST image ever.


**4. The Motion Picture** - An underrated performance!  I can't get enough of his posturing in the first half.  Once things loosen up and he's rocking that pajama top, his whimsy shines through and TOS fans could delight in a character who had changed with age...but not really.


**5. The Undiscovered Country** - Fresher than expected and charming as hell.  He leads the second half effortlessly while the sabotage subplot drags on.  What a great send-off.


**6. The Final Frontier** - not a bad performance by any means, merely the least of some greatness.  He's a nice anchor to the bizarre stuff, is hilarious with Spock &amp; Bones, and seems to direct himself decently.


P.S. No Generations, no problem.",Rank Shatner’s performances in the Films
startrek,"I've been watching all of Star Trek the last 4 years and I just hit Enterprise. I've been quite enjoying it so far, and everything about it. It's much better than Voyager in my opinion, especially with the outright likability of characters. (And no barrage of Holodeck episodes)

But the main thing I like about Enterprise is the use of Alien Language. The infancy of the Universal Translator makes it seem like the world is so much more fleshed out, and the crew actually needs to struggle in understanding how to communicate with people. (Also, Faith of the Heart is great!)",Use of Language in ENT
startrek,"When I watch Star Trek, I watch it in order. I just finished watching DS9. After that I'll watch Voyager, then Enterprise, then Discovery,  and then Picard. After that I go back to the original and move forward. Living in China, I've had a lot of time on my hands, so I'm not joking when I say that I've cycled through it twice since January 27th. (when lockdown started)

I don't really know where to start here. But when I was in the middle of season 4 of DS9 4-5 days ago, I started thinking about posting this. I'm pretty sure that 99% of people who actually address MY concerns on topic are going to give me the answer I don't want to hear, but I need to hear it all the same because it's very important to me. 

Star Trek is kind of like a religion to me. I don't have Treky friends. Like I know a few people who watch, but their passion and level of knowledge isn't on my level, so we never bother chatting about it. My parents are good people who went out of their way to make sure that I had a strong sense of right and wrong, but I really feel that Star Trek continued teaching me these kinds of lessons and still gives me great insights on a multitude of topics to this day kinda like the Bible or Quran helps others. 

I'll start with this: I've never been a huge fan of the Star Trek films and I feel like the past 2 TV series have been modeled after the films. I don't mean like the past 2 series have been modeled after the NEW films with Kirk and Spok. I mean ALL of the films.

First, I have nothing against people who enjoy Picard and Discovery, but they really don't quench my thirst and the films never did. Whenever I've watched a Star Trek film in theater I've thought that it's a great fan experience, but it's not something I can marathon or have the urge to watch over and over again. 

Action gets boring. Like, how do I put this? If I was training MMA as a hobby I'm sure I could rewatch every single one of GSP or Anderson Silva's matches 100 times over to gain insight. But I'm not, so I'm just going to watch their fights as many times as I need to feel that I understood what happened and why the fight come to it's eventual conclusion.

When I watched Star Trek films, Discovery for Picard for the first time  I kinda got the same feeling except I was watching those TV series in my home. When I cycle through and get to Discovery and Picard it kinda depresses me and forces me to question whether or not we'll see another series that has a strong emphasis on discovery.

Before I contradict myself, I'm going to briefly describe how I view each series.

**Star Trek:** The original dream. A snippet of what life could be like for humans if we could get over our egos.

**Star Trek Next Generation:** More polished version of Star Trek

**Deep Space 9:** Stronger focus on globalism and multiculturalism and a lot of puppetry.

**Voyager:** Epic sci-fi remake of Homeward Bound.

**Enterprise:** Gritty prequel that puts Archer on a pedestal the soars miles above Kirk, Picard, Sisko and Janeway.

**Discovery:** Affirms that the ""Me Too"" movement is to be taken seriously. Makes everything look more technologically advanced since there were so many kinds of technology in the previous series that don't seem quite as far out of our grasp as they used to.

**Picard:** 100% unadulterated fan service.

Hear me out, Patrick Stewart is my TV dad. I knew it before I even knew the term TV dad, but from my perspective we aren't getting Star Trek that introduces me to anything new. I'm not a well read individual. I might read 10-15 books a year and no more than 3 of those will be fictional. 

I get more out of Discovery than Picard and watching every episode of Discovery for the first time reminded me what sadness felt like because I had this crazy idea in my head that Hollywood was still capable assisting me with the broadening of my mind.

I absolutely love the quality of the special effects in the latter 2 series, but is it too much to ask for new content?","Would it be profitable to make another Star Trek series like TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager or Enterprise? Warning: Excessively long!"
startrek,"Just want to say I’m in season 4 and the show has grown on me a lot that I enjoy it. Mostly what I meant by the episodes is more what is necessary viewing and worth watching. From my experience the first 5 episodes of S1, and 2 of course, are necessary. While there’s some in season 1 it’s mostly forgettable and I was really bored during it. S2 had more but again mostly same until I think about episode 15 or 16. I did complain about them cause 14-16 all had O’Brian as s**t out of luck but either 15 or 16 really started it going for me. I think that’s about the time they find the Founders:
S3 I’ve always heard is where the show really picks up and I have to agree as that season and up to where I am now are great. So I agree on that but it does need the last 10+ episodes of S2 to work cohesively. The show grew on me I’ll say that much. 

Now to Odo. I f***ing love this guy. No nonsense but has an amazing sense of humor that I love along with his love/hate/respect relationship with Quark, who should seriously be in prison but that’s beside the point. Right now on episode “Bar Association”, #15 if that’s better, and he straight up calls out a few of the times the Enterprise D got boarded and/or looted. Finally someone acknowledges that the Enterprise got jacked or whatever! 

Seriously the flagship of the Federation got boarded so many times, by non omniscient/omnipotent beings since they are harder to defend against, it kinda bothered me in S6 with the Die Hard in space episode, not saying it wasn’t a great episode it was. I’m just glad someone said something about it out loud: not some admiral reading the reports and going “Jesus Christ. The Enterprise. Boarded again! That’s the fifth time this year and the 10th since Picard took over.” Probably not that much but let’s be fair it’s still a significant number of times. Those security updates every year didn’t help lol. 

Side note even with all this I would love it if the Enterprise E also had a number of the same types of things and the admiral I mentioned just gave up and resigned after the first cause he was just so done with the Enterprises’ ridiculous situations. And he’s a descendant of an admiral that was doing the same in Kirks time so it’s like a family curse for the Enterprise. “No way this new enterprise after 100+ years is going to end up like that one.” Literally a week later “We just got word the Enterprise D came back from an alternate dimension” the admiral flips a table out his window.

startrek,"Tuvix. It's clear a lot of people don't like him. And it seems clear that this is because of two main reasons:

1) The ethical predicament which the crew is forced into as a result of his existence is also forced onto the audience. We don't want to think about it because it makes us uncomfortable. And we hate what makes us uncomfortable.

2) He's not conventionally attractive. Now this is what kind of what bothers me. The whole point (as we all very well know) of Star Trek is to see the bigger picture, to maintain mind over matter and seek justice whenever the opportunity presents itself.

I agree with what Captain Janeway chose in the end, because Tuvok (whose culture teaches him that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few) and Neelix didn't consent to losing their preexisting individuality. If their consciousnesses could have been separated while they were merged, they probably would've advocated to return to that individuality. Of course this is a luxury they didn't have, but I think we can agree that they didn't like it any more than anyone else did.

Cultural mindset is an ever-evolving thing. Right now discrimination against what is socially deemed un-beautiful is just as real as other forms of discrimination. It's just not in the sociocultural or political spotlight right now. We're all hardwired to favor what looks and acts like us: humanoid, laterally symmetrical, emotional. Understandable.

Maybe I'm taking this too seriously but the fact this episode was and is so controversial only highlights an underlying sentiment that doesn't coincide with the values of Star Trek and, by extension, our values as a fandom. In scifi and in real life we're faced at any moment with the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial lifeforms that evolved from a culmination of innumerable variables, we can't possibly imagine what they'd look, sound, or behave like. All I know is if we ever do encounter aliens, they will be so unlike us that we won't know what to feel other than absolute terror, at least initially. We would owe it to them to let go of our anthropocentric and egocentric beliefs and desires. We have empathy; it's our duty to use it.",Hear me out guys pls

Unfortunately there was no positronic matrix due to the ban. After all, it's not like the Daystrom Institute had one just sitting in a cupboard...

Oh wait.

Now the obvious answer is that turning on B4 (or Lore for that matter as he is presumably dismantled and in a different cupboard somewhere) would be illegal. But this isn't some random kid, this is the son of Captain William flipping Riker! And we know it's possible to only activate B4's cognitive functions and not his motor ones thanks to Nemesis.

That's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).

Even Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.

The helm officers are the most visible example of redshirts, other than the captain and first officer. But we see loads of redshirts roaming the halls of the Enterprise-D all the time. What do they do all day? Just continuously study how to command and practice battle simulations? Do Picard or Riker teach courses when they're not on the bridge? There can't be more than a handful of helm officers on a ship the size of the Ent-D, rotating shifts as required.",What do the command track officers do all day on the Enterprise-D?
startrek,Back in the 90s I started Voyager a little before Kes left and watched it to the end. I never watched the first few seasons. Yesterday I decided to start Voyager from the beginning and boy am I enjoying this. I loved Janeway before but damn I love her so much more now. I know the ending and how things go their but to finally have the foundation is really enjoyable . I know Voyager gets allot of hate and I don’t disagree with it but I still enjoy it. All the actors are great in Season 1. Tom Paris telling Chakotay to turn into a bird and fly away is laughable in the worst possible way . Neelix is ridiculous as he always has been. The doctor is awesome. I’m so enjoying this.,I’m really enjoying rewatching Voyager
startrek,"Being slightly provocative, but generally I think it is true.  


The original series was shot in the 60's. Of course it looks antiquated and that Kirk is a bit misogynistic, but when you compare it to other shows at the time it was streets ahead. I'm also amazed at how much of a difference the re-mastered version makes!  


I like TNG, but there is this fable about it that it was all good. For me, I think the first 2 seasons were awfully nd it got better in season 3. It wasn't until season 4 that it gets really good.  


DS9, of the TNG/DS/Voy era is my favourite. The Federation is now not so squeaky clean and perfect like they are in TNG. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the positive outlook for Humanity. In fact, I love it. However, I'm not so naive to think that Humanity will be wonderful in another 300 years. We'll still have our issues, and DS9 is good at showing that.  


Voyager, an attempt together back to the travelling spaceship but have a different look &amp; feel. Just too many annoying characters (Yes I'm looking at you Neelix.. at least Wesley grew out of being annoying!). I'm certainly enjoying it more than I did the first time and it does have some of my favourite characters in it (The Dr, 7 of 9).

Enterprise. I feel so sorry for it. If you look at it really, it was good right out of the door. I reckon if they'd got their full 7 seasons it would now be regarded as one of the best Trek's. I like the premise of Humanity really first getting out there. Sure, I know that T'Pol was brought in to be eye candy for the guys, but she does a brilliant Vulcan! I actually like the whole Crew.

Discovery. How can people not watch it, or only watch 2 seasons and say it is awful? Think of the first 2 seasons of TNG for god's sake! I love Discovery. I think they've done a great job at a difficult time period. I think the guest captains (Lorca, Pike) were also great! I can do the suspension of belief about the Klingons too. Why does everyone give this a hard time, when they ignore the difference in the Klingons between TOS and ST:The Movie? Sure, it's not episodic. So what? That's not how TV is watched now (I""m binge watching Voyager at the moment). I love that you watch the season, see the ends nd then watch it again and get some of the subtleties you missed the first time around.

Picard: TNG 3.0 (TNG 2.0 was the movies). I like it. Again, not episodic. Funnily enough though, Whilst Picard is the glue, I'm enjoying the other characters more. I forget his name, but the Roman Samurai needs to be fleshed out more and I hope we see more of him, but everyone else is great! I really didn't like the Riker to the rescue though. Why would they put a reserve captain in charge of an entire squadron? Stupid! He'd done his cameo, wasn't necessary.  


TAS: I missed that. I've always had problems with it, but I suspect I'll find it interesting now... going off how I'm disliking Voyager less. Also because nuances of TAS have crept into Discovery. I'd love to see this redone in CGI.  


All in all, we are damn lucky we aren't Star Wars fans, although I do watch it, we have great TV to watch. Some of the best ever made and for a 50 years old TV program to stand the test of time is amazing!  


I say don't judge them... just enjoy them for what they are..... bloody brilliant TV (&amp; Some really great movies).",I think it's dumb to compare the various shows
startrek,"I grew up in a household that loved Star Wars and Star Trek. In fact, my dad probably consistently watched more Trek than Star Wars, but we talked more about Star Wars and were more excited for those movies. He was more of a fan of the movies than the shows too.

I personally like Star Wars more, and I recognize that both fans are super finicky. However, I've noticed that Trekkies are far more intolerant of anything new with Trek than Star Wars fans are with Star Wars.
Maybe since Trek is more niche...?

Despite Last Jedi nonsense, Star Wars fans have been more connected.
I am wondering why both can't just accept anything new and different. The same sucks. You have the original, so love that and try to embrace the new.

I just started watching Voyager last night and it was something I never thought I'd do cause I thought it looked dumb, but I am actually really loving it more so than other Trek stuff.

startrek,"I've been binge watching Voyager for the first time since it was released, because my memory of it was so bad. Having said that, I've seen some really good episodes. However, season 5 so far is generally quite good.

S5E6 ""Timeless"". The first major breaking of the temporal directive by members of the voyager crew. Really good episodes. Interesting when you see half of sevens cranium. However, the whole episode is excellent. Interesting Captain La Forge.... yet he isn't a Captain in the prequels for Picard (Comics/Books). yes I know it is a different time line.

S5E7 ""Infinite Regress"". Great story. Basically Borg schizophrenia. Some amazing acting from Jerry Ryan. Especially when she changes personalities. The switch is just stunning at times. Also an interesting story line in that she's seeing people whom she has assimilated.

S5E8 ""Nothing Human"". The creature that attaches itself to B'Elanna is absolutely crap. However, the whole story on the morality of using medical research based on, at beast, questionable techniques is superb.

S5E11""Latent Image"". AN interesting ethical dilemma that they resolve in the end, but what I really loved about this episode is it is again an extension of the Dr where he ceases to be less machine and more a sentient life form. He actually talks about the algorithms he has to help him make decisions, and in this case he is given a no-win situation where he has to make a choice, and then how doe she deal with it.

I just can't see the Captain of the Ship spending 16 hrs in the Holodeck with the Dr. Once more Janeway knows more than everyone else!","Voyager season 5, so far is generally quite good."

Ok, I understand that Spock wants to show Kirk that Saavik is capable of commanding the Enterprise after the Kobayashi Maru failure (not failure). But she's not actually piloting the Enterprise, Sulu is. And therefore there's no reason for Kirk of McCoy to be on edge. Even if Saavik had give the wrong command, Sulu wouldn't have crashed the Enterprise. And the only two commands she gives (that we can hear) are ""aft thrusters Mr Sulu... Ahead one-quarter impulse power"". Not much.

The scene is slightly frustrating because Sulu is not showing piloting skills (he's probably done that hundreds of times) nor Saavik commanding skills.",Out of spacedock sequence in Star Trek II
startrek,"I really enjoyed Star Trek: Picard and while personally I feel it's a show we can judge ""Pre-Nepenthe"" and ""Post-Nepenthe"" (meaning it was an okay show up till Nepenthe and then it became a great show) the ending has made a lot of people consider if it was really the way things were meant to end. 

I've had this conversation with a lot of friends since the Picard finale and I have agree, it feels like there was a different ending planned and many people think the whole android body thing was a cop out.

Was the original plan right up till the end for Picard to die and not be resurrected but that plan got sidelined when Pat Stewart decided he was having fun and wanted to do season 2?

There's really absolutely no reason to do the android body thing--- what does it get them? It's not like Stewart was playing a significantly older character and with an android body he could now play his own age and jump around. It's not like people would have questioned Picard still adventuring at his age and 24th century medicine keeping him going. 

I've had numerous people say to me this was a cop out and a way to kill Picard but not really kill him so they can do season 2.  Rewatching Nepenthe and Post-Nepenthe I have to agree. It seems like they were setting us up all along for Picard to die.",What Was The Original Ending Of Picard? Was it always meant to end how it did? - SPOILERS

All onscreen deaths count as people who die on screen(pretty self explanatory). So during the chase, Picard’s mentor would count as an onscreen death, or the Yellow shirt who gets killed during Descent would also count. However, ship destruction and causality reports won’t count. So things like the Yamato being destroyed and the destruction of Romulus don’t count. People dying off screen I may count if they are important. Such as during lower decks when that Bajoran lady dies offscreen.

It was through research and reverse engineering the Borg technology that made the 2009 Enterprise look so much more advanced that the original NCC-1701 “No bloody A,B, or C.”

* Star Trek spoofing 007 turns in the classic ""main cast trapped in holodeck with safeties off"" setup. Garak brings the darkness and is ready to sacrifice someone to save Dax. Also ""I signed up for the wrong spy agency"" is hilarious coming from Garak. 
* Rom's a genius. He even makes use of a spatula for the holosuite.
* Sisko with the classic ""villain destroys most of Earth to create order"" cliche.
* Bashir and Garak in the cave is intense. ""It's just a flesh wound.""
* Bashir using Garak's lines to convince Dr. Sisko he wants the join him.

**Episode 10: Homefront**

* Odo griping about stuff in his room being centimeters off being chaos. Changeling terrorism. 
* Quark's reaction to Bashir and O'Brien downing thier drinks. Quark talking about the economic scare is hilarious. 
* Sisko and Odo talking to admiral Layton and \*not\* Leah Brahms.  Also, Sisko has the old TNG era uniform.  (What's the in universe reason for the uniform differences between TNG and it's spin-offs?)
* Jake and Nog reuniting.
* Defense pushing for surveillance.  This must have been scary in a pre-9/11 America.  Odo taking phaser sweeps for the team. 
* Sisko and his dad reminds me of when I visit my own Dad in New Orleans. 
* The Admiral!
* The real admiral echoing O'Brien and Bashir's sentiment about defending home is a nice touch. 
* Dad Sisko pulling rank on Ben is a total parent move. 
* Then Joe cuts himself, Ben goes to look, and then Joe talking some sense into Ben. 
* The Admiral is kind of snakey. 
* Odo: ""Fear is a powerful and dangerous thing.""

**Episode 11: Paradise Lost**

startrek,"I’ll admit that the color divisions for Federation officers has always puzzled me. Especially because they change so often. 
And, although Deanna did not wear traditional Starfleet clothing for the better part of her appearance, whenever she does it, she wears blue.

Anyways, as far as I’m concerned (in TNG and subsequent) the color blue is associated with Medical/Science, yellow is Security/Engineering and red is... Well... Red... I think that red regards to command, but I’m not so sure because of Wesley, Geordi and Worf wearing those colors when they belong on Security or Engineering even at lower ranking. I guess in both Geordi and Wesley’s case they wore red because they were often found on ships’s helm. 
In any case... Feel free to explain it to me since I clearly can’t understand on my own. 

Now to Deanna. As ship’s counselor, I would assume her rank is not only more related to commanding the ship as it is a pretty high one at that. I would assume she would wear red as well. Heck, I could even make more of a case for yellow than blue. Why blue? If it’s in regard to her position as almost a psychiatrist to the ship then it makes sense because it would be Medical, but she helps command the ship more then she helps the crew...

I’m ok with out-of-universe explanations like: “Marina Sirtis just liked blue better” as far as I know the whole red and yellow swap in between series happened because of reasons like that. But I wonder if there is an explanation in the lore for her wearing blue...

(If there is an explanation in-universe for the yellow/red swap, it would be awesome to know as well...)

startrek,"I just started watching the show. “Enterprise” puts in so much more effort into its alien cultures than other Trek shows. I don’t know if this continues to be the case, but 10 episodes in, I’ve really been enjoying how much world building this show gets done. The alien ship in “Unexpected” for example- the three hours of decompression before going on-board, the food growing on the walls, the different looking aliens with their electricity-like powers. The underground society of Terra Nova, their different way of speaking, the “diggers” that they hunt and how they use their skulls as musical instruments. The design of the Vulcan monastery. There were episodes of Voyager where they didn’t even bother to give the aliens forehead ridges, they just looked and behaved like humans and decorated with IKEA furniture.

It’s not just alien cultures, but the world building regarding human culture that I’ve been impressed with too. They don’t have Federation ideals to live up to because there is no Federation yet.  I like how informal and giddy they are, building snowmen on comets, preparing messages for schools on Earth, pointing out the sun in the night sky. Stuff like this makes it feel real to me. Of course the translator isn’t perfect, they’ve barely met any aliens. Of course they’re all scared to use the transporter, dude just beamed up with twigs in his face!

When the saucer crash lands and is destroyed, Picard gets sucked into the energy ribbon. Guinan helps him find Kirk and later they get out, fight Soran and somehow the people who crash landed are saved.

startrek,"Someone on here once summarized Enterprise as ""Bush era Star Trek"" and that nails it for me.

TNG and DS9 might be distinctively 90ies in their own way, but they encapsulate all the charm of low-budget sci-fi first and foremost. I would describe them as ""human"" rather than ""American"" or specifically dated to any decade. Same as the original series being obviously from the 60ies, but more so: timeless.

Enterprise is tainted by all the cold ugliness of early-2000s American television. Especially from a European perspective, it feels so distinctively national all of a sudden that it's really off-putting. it's not in the setting (post-national earth and space) or storyline, it's all evident on a meta-level in the languages of production, setpieces, character writing, themes, set design, costumes.

The whole show feels like it's desperate to be less niche and nerdy and more widely appealing to general American audiences in 2002 and as a result, lost its soul in the process.

I mean... There is a character named ""Trip Tucker"" who looks exactly like his dumb jock name. He likes to punch people.

TL:DR:

Enterprise lacks the warm and familiar, hopeful and fantastical identity of other Trek. If Jack Bauer had a guest spot on an Enterprise episode, he would feel *less out of place there* than a member of the Enterprise crew who  appeared on another Star Trek show in turn.

\- Setting a Trek series at that specific time period is actually a really cool idea. The show does get a little better as it goes on. There is some character development, even for f\*\*\* Trip.

startrek,"I have been rewatching Voyager after the finale of Picard; and, after she goes full-on eye dilation in the cell, I got the impression that 7 is destined for Borg royalty. 

Here's my evidence. 

Going back to Dark Frontier,  you first see 7 and the queen interact.  What's so surprising about this is that the queen uses personal pronouns.   This is a trait that both she and 7 have in common.

Furthermore,  in the same episode, it's revealed that drones from unimatrix 01 are in close proximity to the queen.  7 of 9 is tertiary adjunct for 01, so we can infer that 7 had previous intersection with the queen prior to Scorpion.  Also, if we understand that higher numbers mean higher rank, as was the case when Harry Kim was demoted from 6 to 2 of 10 in the Omega Directive, then it adds more weight to the evidence that 7 would have routinely been in proximity to the queen. Though it's not clear the consequences of that proximity,  7 would have been an on hand for the queen.


Next, referring back to Dark Frontier, the queen focuses on teaching 7 lessons.  She tries to have her choose to adopt the Borg way, rather than have it foisted upon her.   The goal was to preserve the same individuality that the queen demonstrates,  but have 7 agree that the Borg way is correct.  This duality of making individual choices, but for the benefit of the collective,  may be a key requirement for coronation. 

Also, in the same episode, 7 is able to persuade the queen to let refugees escape assimilation,  7 is immediately tended to after a minor injury (royal treatment for a borg?), the queen compromises on her duties because she doesn't want to push 7 too hard (compromise is irrelevant), reveals that 7 was placed on Voyager to regain individuality, and apologizes that the lessons are difficult for 7.

This is all done under the guise of conquering humanity,  but consider that things can have dual intents.  While assimilating humanity is an obvious goal, this could also be about making 7 get successor.

Lastly, I refer you the Picard episodes involving Ex-Bs.  Their disconnection from the collective leaves the drones' personalities damaged.   But, as the queen says, 7 is the only drone to gain  Individuality.   This difference may be what would eventually empower 7 to exert will like the queen if/when crowned.  In Broken Pieces,  7 exerts this exact will in the cell after being wired in a similar fashion as the queen.  She fits the queen pattern.",My fan theiry: 7 of 9 was/is next in like to succeed the Borg Queen

Maybe it's just because of quarantine and covid, but I *love* that they set aside their differences for the shared goal of **simply going home.** They knew they had to be there for each other.

The dominion war ended very well, we had our big fight(that refused footage sadly), the founder gave up, we had tension with the Cardasians and then their switch midway through(which was lucky for Starfleet, since I noticed they were using the same tactics Robert E Lee used at Gettysburg and you know how that turned out.), you then went to the treaty and everything was fine, but then you had Dukat. He goes and summons the Pah wraiths. My problem is that I’ve never liked, “wipe out everything” threats, and that is exactly what the Pah-wraiths are.

startrek,"The Silent Star (""Der Schweigende Stern"") is a 1960 East German/Polish science fiction film based on ""The Astronauts"" by  Stanisław Lem. While it is set (probably) in the 1970s as opposed to the 2260s, it has a very Star Trek Original Series vibe. It is about a multi-national group of scientists who have put aside earth-bound concerns (race, religion, politics, nationality) to get into a spaceship and go on an adventure together for the good of all humanity. 

But what is interesting is that you are seeing this familiar story told through a Soviet Bloc lens. In TOS, everyone works together but implicitly everyone is basically American - the ship is even the ""USS Enterprise"". In The Silent Star, it is implicit that the Soviets have the upper hand.

An example of what I mean: Toward the beginning, some reporters are interviewing the mission leader, a soviet professor. 
Reporter: ""Why not just a team of Soviet scientists? It's their rocket!"" 
Cosmonaut: ""Landing on Venus cannot only belong to one nation. We are not just internationalist in our politics. In a peaceful world we don't keep our successes to ourselves.""

The rocket is Soviet-built and they are letting an American tag along from a sense of good-will. The Soviets were also the first to land on the moon, and have an international research base there. It's the same happy, cooperative future, but with the Soviets on top! 

It's no surprise that a show made by and for Americans would be pro-American, and one by and for members of the Soviet Bloc would be pro-Soviet. I think it's an interesting jumping-off point for thinking about the implicit assumptions of Star Trek, though. A ""Star Trek"" made by Vulcans might look very different again. 

One last note, I don't want to push this film too hard: The plot is well-trodden ground by this point, and the details are a bit hard to follow in places. The gender politics are _very_ TOS as well, unfortunately. But I think in general, TOS fans may get a kick out of it.","Star Trek through a cold war lens: ""The Silent Star"" (1960)"
startrek,"I just recently finished watching the entire DS9 series for the first time. As a longtime fan of Voyager, TNG, and TOS, I never got around to watching DS9 until now. I simply wanted to praise the show - it was a really enjoyable experience to watch. Specifically:

* I felt like overall, the writing was consistently good throughout the series. Like other longstanding series of Trek I felt like the show definitely picked up and got better as it progressed. 
* I enjoyed the portrayal of Sisko and his son Jake as a normal single father and son relationship. They just genuinely loved each other and there wasn't ever any weird or forced tension between the two of them. It was simple, and it worked.
* I absolutely adored Odo and his whole backstory. I would have loved to have seen more done with him as a character, and I wish he would have been given more opportunities to use his unique shapeshifting abilities. Rene Auberjonois did an outstanding job in that role.
* I enjoyed the interesting storytelling that came out of the Dax character. I thought they handled the transition to Ezri Dax surprisingly well considering she was in it just for the one season.
* I loved Garek as a side character. Initially I thought he was really weird but I appreciated the development and attention he was given. I thought the actor who played him did a really good job. I wish there would have been more of him!
* I absolutely hated Vedek/Kai Winn but I think that is a testament to the actress's portrayal of her character and her writing. Both were well done.
* I did think Dukat was resurrected as a character too much. Once would have been fine but he ""came back"" too much after I was given the impression he was gone for good.
* I felt like the very last episode tied things up better than I expected it to. Compared to the very last episode of Voyager I found it to be a lot more believable and realistic.
* Standout episodes (sorry don't remember the specific names or #):
   * The one where the team recruits Garek to sneak into Cardassia
   * The one where they travel back in time to the TOS era (brilliant writing and editing in this one)
   * The one where Jake loses his dad in a freak accident and his entire life plays out trying to get his dad back (very good writing in this one - I cried!!)
   * The one where they form a baseball team - loved when Odo, with great satisfaction, booted people from the game.
* Can an HD remaster of DS9 and Voyager happen please?!?!

startrek,"I've been reading a lot lately about the constant advancements in virtual reality tech. Just last year London's Saatchi Gallery immersed visitors in a twenty-minute, interactive (mostly) ""virtual reality experience"" that they could see, hear, smell, and feel on their skin. Haptic tech is making it possible to experience the sensation of touching virtual objects or standing in a virtual wind. Right now VR developers are busy incorporating eye tracking tech into VR headsets, making better-quality graphics possible, because the virtual environment only has to be in full resolution where the user is looking. Artificial intelligence may soon enable non-player characters to engage in natural conversations. VR is constantly getting better at imitating reality. Eventually, it may seem very real.

Reading about all of the constant progress in VR led me to imagine a future in which you could experience almost anything you've seen in an episode of Star Trek, as if you were inside the Star Trek universe, almost like a holodeck with programs based on Star Trek episodes. Think of it. What if you could experience what it would be like to  stand on the bridge of the Enterprise, whichever registry number you prefer, as it goes into warp, pilot the Defiant through the Bajoran wormhole, challenge Kira Nerys to a game of springball, or visit the city of ShiKahr on the planet Vulcan with Spock as your guide? Personally, I'd be thrilled just to be able to walk the promenade of Deep Space Nine and see my favorite characters there or explore the interior of the Enterprise D. It might also be fun to play tongo with Jadzia Dax at Quark's (if someone would create rules for the game based on what we see and hear in DS9). 

Now imagine that you have access to a complete library of highly realistic, multi-sensory virtual environments faithfully recreated from all that we see in Star Trek TV shows and movies. **What would you do, if you could experience the Star Trek universe** ***from the inside*** **as a newly-created character?** What would you be?

startrek,"And I just wanted to say a couple of things... spoilers incoming, obviously...

I really adored the three-way interaction between Seska, Culluh, and Janeway. Culluh is a deeply egotistical man who comes from a deeply misogynistic culture. Yet here, he is caught in between two extremely assertive, intelligent, and cunning women. As the negotiations slip out of his control, his own impotent misogynist rage drives him to attempt to reassert his authority, but Janeway just shuts him down and later so does Seska too.

Given Seska's skills and her domineering personality, it's very likely that had their takeover of Voyager in ""Basics"" succeeded, the Nistrim would have conquered all the other Kazon sects and began presiding over a united Kazon species. Culluh would be the de jure leader, but all power would effectively belong to Seska.

One minor detail that I found interesting - Tuvok was one of the conservative Starfleet officers who opposed Spock's proposed peace with the Klingons in 2293. As he will later share, at that time, he was serving on the Excelsior under Sulu, and he harbored an intense dislike for humans. When Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant, Tuvok was already over a 100 years old. His evolution really is interesting. 

This was a really great episode, and to top it off, it ends with a really inspiring speech from Janeway:

&gt;In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where  shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to  rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Federation.

startrek,"We are about a month away from the twenty-sixth anniversary of *All Good Things*, which first aired twenty-five years after *Turnabout Intruder -* 5/23/94 and 6/3/69 respectively. I know when I was a kid in the nineties (between about five and nine years old), TOS looked pretty hokey at times; I could easily tell it was an old show, from the womens' haircuts, the uniforms, the colors, the blockiness of the consoles and dated special effects and so on. TNG was, by comparison, super slick and brand new, all subdued tones and elegant curved surfaces. I enjoyed them both anyway - I always preferred the movies with the original cast, they just seemed much more human and, ironically, grounded in reality compared to the TNG films. 

Anyway, I assume people still introduce their kids to prior Star Trek, so I was wondering if kids these days see TNG as being just as hokey and outdated to them as the TOS did in our day. I've been perusing some of the remastered TNG episodes and they look gorgeous, but they also reveal some of the limits of the matte sets and costume makeup, which might look pretty corny to someone who didn't grow up with the lower-res originals.",Twenty and thirty-something parents of /r/startrek - does TNG look as dated to your kids as TOS looked to you at their age?
startrek,"To give a little context - about three years ago I decided I wanted to watch Star Trek. I'd grown up with TNG on the television but aside from seeing it on whenever someone else was watching it, I didn't know very much about the over arching story. I spent the next 20 months watching every iteration of Star Trek that was out there. I used to have the dates all saved as to when I started and finished each but it essentially went:

- TOS

- Star Trek Continues (I know its not canon but it was good)

- TNG

- DS9 (my personal favorite)

- VOY

- ENT

- DIS

In between Star Trek Continues and TNG I watched all six movies with the original series cast. After TNG I watched First Contact and Insurrection but somehow missed Nemesis. 

Late Friday I started the first season of Picard. By saturday I'd finished it and frankly I didn't think it was very good but I stuck it out. After it was over I really missed the Picard I grew to know over 7 seasons of TNG. I ended up sitting down and watching a marathon of First Contact, Insurrection and finally Nemesis. 

None of these were exactly fantastic movies by any stretch but they were, in my opinion, far more true to Picard's character than the actual Picard show was. Poor writing and plot aside, Picard's character in 'Picard' just seemed too different. The whole tone of the show was far more Discovery than it was TNG and frankly I think that was part of the problem. I don't dislike DIS (anymore - that first season was hard) but I had high hopes that Picard would be a return to the Trek of old...instead it was more of the same watered down new age Trek that we've seen since the JJ Abbrams movies and Discovery. 

I just miss the hopeful optimism of TNG and Captain Picard. I miss the vaulted speeches where he defends humanity's advancements to John De Lancie (as an example). Picard as a show really missed the point of Picard's character in my opinion and honestly I hope it gets better from here because I feel like it can't get much worse than a crappy French accent and an eye patch.","I ran a marathon yesterday with First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis and it made me really sad about Picard"

I miss the idealism of the earlier Star Trek, where we get to know the characters intimately and understand their challenges rather than big faceless entities with their corruption and failings etc.

Based on what they've said about the show, I've no interest in watching Picard. However, my ridiculous headcanon to explain the whole situation that caused the Zhat Vash is that a video game historian/nerd from somewhere in the 30th (or whatever) century went back in time to get the original Mass Effect trilogy for a museum, their personal collection, or something, experienced some catastrophe that sends their ship back in time to Aia and mostly damages the ship such that it's only able to beam bits and pieces of of the games into someone's head as a jumble, mixing the geth and the reapers with information about a &gt;!cyborg tentacled species!&lt; that should be avoided.

startrek,"Fans often talk at length about their favourite captain, but I want to discuss what you think about all of them. What do you like and dislike about them all? 

Here’s mine if anyone is interested. 

Pike
Best: He’s the most human, flawed yet heroic, and the epitome of StarFleet. When I think of a captain I’d like to serve with, it’s him. He’s my favourite.

Worst: Not enough of him.


Kirk
Best: The fact that he often decides what’s moral, rather then going with what’s expected of him. Unlike other captains, he knows that The Federation isn’t perfect and so he bends the letter of the law to do what he thinks is right. He is also a tactical genius, and charismatic as hell.

Worst: Due to sixties writing he can come off as a little emotionless, and sometimes too stern.

Picard
Best: Morally one of the finest officers in the fleet. Probably the most moral captain of all time. 

Worst: He is so goddamn stuffy and up himself. Especially early on. I get people love him a lot and I think he’s a great character, but if I knew him in real life, he’d be the worst boss.

Sisko
Best: I love his backstory and how he is a family man at heart. I love his relationship with the Bajorans, and think he’s a tactical genius. 

Worst: Too militaristic for me. Took too long to find his character. 

Janeway
Best: When written well, she is the paragon of virtue. Kind yet brave, commanding respect without being cruel. Moral without being naive. Also the smartest of all the captains we’ve seen. 

Worst: Unfortunately she was written inconsistently. Sometimes she’d be willing to bend the rules, other times she’d stick to her guns no matter what. Sometimes she was a warm kind person, other times she was cold and stern. 

Archer
Best: I love the flawed perspective of his character. Making him the person to inspire The Federation, he could have been too perfect, instead he was written as flawed and complicated. Sadly his arc was cut short, and we never got to see him at his best. He was also a keen strategist and a willing explorer.

Worst: Like Janeway, he was written inconsistently, although in my opinion less so. He sometimes became cold for no real reason, and other times he seemingly gave up his ethics all together. 


Georgiou and Lorca
I’m including these two together, because to me they’ve both got the exact same flaws and qualities, but for completely opposite reasons.

Best: I immediately want a show for both these characters. They are portrayed by fantastic actors and had a lot of stories to tell. If they were allowed to run their course, they may be in my top rung of captains. 

Worst: They weren’t allowed to run their course. For one reason or another they were both written out of their stories at the earliest possible place and weren’t allowed to evolve. In the case of Lorca, the biggest shame was the end twist. Before that we were given a complex and morally grey man. Sadly that didn’t last, and he was quickly turned into a moustache twirling villain. I didn’t mind the idea, in fact it was very well done, but the final execution wasn’t good enough. Sad.",What Are You’re Thoughts On All The Captains?
startrek,"At least twice the Borg tried to assimilate Earth with only 1 cube (second time with a sphere in it as well) and failed. 

The Borg Queen told 7 of 9 they they wouldn't succeed a 3rd time which is why they wanted to develop another method of assimilation by assimilating them by throwing a nanoprobe virus into the atmosphere which is a method they were developing for ""highly resistant species""

Why not just sent multiple Cubes if they want Earth so badly? They obviously wanted Earth badly enough to go thru the trouble of capturing 7 of 9 to help them in the assimilation so it seems to me like it would be worthy of them to spare a few Cubes for a while away from another task. Seems efficient enough to me and worth it from their perspective

startrek,"So here's a thought experiment, because why not.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would happen if different Star Trek captains, main ones from the shows or maybe others if they are fleshed out enough, found themselves faced with the Deep Space Nine assignment?

I've been pondering this specifically with reference to Deep Space Nine, because in that series the chain of events that unfolds kind of isn't focused on Sisko, he is at the forefront of events and he definitely shapes them, but a lot of what goes on is bigger than him. Theoretically any captain could take that assignment, of course he's the emissary as well, but hypothetically we could assume another captain was a child of the prophets instead.

So what, in you good folks opinion, would happen if for whatever reason Picard had caught the DS9 assignment, or Janeway? Or maybe Riker gets his first command on the station, or some sort of time-skipped Kirk, Archer or Lorca?

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thoughts are:

Picard probably messes it up and the Dominion wins. I could see him handling the Cardassians more effectively, because he's got longstanding beefs there, but I think the Vorta would be able to play him long enough to get a foot in the door and take the Alpha Quadrant. If he got tested the same way that Sisko did to work out his intentions in that simulator the Dominion might be all like, ""Solids are back on the menu boys!"" and just go straight in.

Janeway is plenty ruthless enough to get things done and I suspect that her closer relationship with Starfleet (remember Sisko is about to quit when he takes the job) probably means less guff from Bajoran separatists, more redshirts on the ground of Bajor and more ships at the wormhole on the regular. So I could see things all going pretty stale in that regard, a perpetual standoff.

Kirk flirts with the female changeling and the war is called off.

Lorca lets the Pah-wraiths out and everything goes directly sideways.",How Would Other Captains Have Handled The DS9 Story?
startrek,"While I enjoyed the episode overall (although I don't get why it was so necessary to study the quasar immediately instead of coming back here after delivering the medicine... but whatever) I have to say the ending is really strange.

You know what I'm talking about, the way they all try to make Spock realize he actually acted on emotion instead of pure cold logic for once. They're all having a hoot, laughing and in a really good jolly mood. Immediately after they just lost two crew members who were brutally murdered. Really?   
I feel like the writers must have forgotten about this when writing this ending, that's just nuts.",[TOS] Galileo Seven - small thought on ending
startrek,"A thing I have turning over in my mind a lot is why I don't like new Trek and I think I finally know why. Some Picard season 1 spoilers below. 

The last two seasons of new Star Trek, but also just a lot of science fiction in general, do these ultimate ""all life everywhere at risk"" storylines and it takes all the weight out of a story.

I was listening to the The Greatest Discovery podcast and they were talking about all the ways the themes of Picard season 1 were unfolding and upon re-watching, yeah, I could see all that, but it didn't make me feel anything.

I feel like introducing some kind of universe ending super bad guy robs the story of any weight it could have had. We know they're probably not ending Picard on a note of all organic life is getting destroyed, so the stakes don't feel real. All the best episodes of Star Trek are ones with personal or political stakes, where the outcome is genuinely uncertain. Obviously the format dictates a return to some form of status quo, that's television. But I feel like this kind of ultra high stakes scenario is so cartoonish, _especially_ when it's the kind you can solve by hitting the right button at the last second.

There's a lot of criticism of gritty Trek and that it should be more optimistic and I don't agree with that. Some of the best Trek is about taking a hard look at moral ambiguity, such as the Maquis plotlines in DS9. What I think is missing from modern Trek is the mundane. You could have the same story of Picard season 1 but, in my opinion, many times more effective if everything just happened at a smaller scale. You don't need to invent an extra secret Romulan police, you don't need an AI that will end all organic life, this can be a story about Picard trying to do right by the people he's wronged and about how he misses Data and is forced to contemplate death and age and his own blind idealism. Those are all great themes that the show is tackling. I don't think it needs big AI space worms being summoned through a portal.

startrek,"An interesting experience! I watched the season in the space of about a week, so everything was fresh going through. 

It would have been nice if the mycelial realm wasn't a multiverse-ending disaster waiting to happen, as an infinite number of universes will result in one ignoring the warning signs and killing everything. However, I can see it being a multiverse-spanning network essential to their travel to the mirror universe. I enjoyed the references to interphasic space, Defiant, and transporter travel in an ion storm. 

The overshoot on return could have been bigger. I found it disappointing that the Federation could be broken so thoroughly in less than a year. 

Some of Burnham's voiceovers were good, others a little cheesy. Still, an actor can only do so much with their lines and direction. 

Now, I did find mirror Georgiou disappointing. She just hands over the detonator and walks away. Who was Admiral Cornwell's speech for anyway? The bridge crew had to know the real captain was dead and all of them knew of the mirror universe. 

Starfleet resorting to genocide to win the war is...it's not ideal. I would expect more from the Federation. I think if we were in the war longer, seeing the endless grind and loss of system after system, it would have been easier to accept their resorting to genocide. Popping in at the end leaves us too fresh to accept the desperation. 

I don't think L'Rell will have a long-term hold on the Klingon Empire if her only tool is to kill everyone. I'm also deeply surprised that a small Klingon task force in eyesight of Earth (undefended, no Starfleet ships in sight) would turn back when they could claim the honor of desecrating the enemy homeworks. 

Having watched the clip on YouTube back when it first aired, I got very excited when we reached The Scene. Seeing Enterprise and hearing the theme put a massive smile on my face and a thrill in my heart. 

I'm looking forward to season 2 and seeing a proper Klingon D7.",Finished DSC season 1

So now that season 1 is over I'm thinking hard about season 2. And I very much enjoyed the show. Yes, yes, there were the occasional plot holes and a couple uses of the idiot ball, but overall I enjoyed the story. But there were times when they only scratched the surface of some of the ramifications of things, and I really wished they had delved deeper into them. 

One thing in particular that I hope for is an exploration of the nature of consciousness and what it means for Picard to be alive in Season 2.

I would really like for Season 2 to spend some time exploring what that means ethically, emotionally, and how it could affect the Star Trek universe.

In Picard, the ships (few as they are) that we see have sort of the same look and I miss the days when Starfleet ships were painted and not just metallic. I’m guessing the reasoning will be something along the lines of, ships don’t rust in space or whatever. Or maybe not. Maybe it’s a new, fancy metallic paint made for high warp efficiency.

startrek,"So I'm mid season 2 of Voyager and loving it. Seriously, this is what I love Star Trek for - discovering new life forms, being put in morally questionable situations. The villains are just the villains, they usually have a valid reason to be--if there is a villan in the first place. This is my kind of sci-fi.

However, despite I love the show ideas and the casting, the characters are underdeveloped and underused. It's season 2 and I still don't know much more about Paris or Torres than I knew from the pilot. The best developed character is the Doctor, which is good since he's just super fun to watch. TOS had Spock, TNG had Data, DS9 had Odo, and here it's the doctor. It's funny the least human character is always the best.

But, I really don't like the fact they underuse Tuvok so much. I mean, he didn't even lead a SINGLE episode. There were episodes about the Doctor or Kes, but not Tuvok! And he has so much potential, the actor is just great, I love his portrayal of the character. I want more Tuvok!

You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.

startrek,"I know that the writers have already admitted the only reason they created the Queen was because the drones were impersonal and they wanted a tangible antagonist for the audience. 

However, it is completely antithetical to the essence of the Borg that they have a Queen. Therefore, in-universe, it is only possible to make sense of her existence by interpreting her as an aberration. And, when viewed through this lens, it actually makes more sense out of every other appearance of the Borg since First Contact. 

For instance, in this light, the existence of Unimatrix Zero then becomes an autoimmune response to the presence of a free radical in the collective in much the same way that Hugh triggered the events of *Descent.* We see similar phenomena in the episode *Drone*, with the children of the episode *Collective*, and with the events relayed in *Survival Instinct*. And, of course, Patient Zero is Locutus. 

In each incident of errant drones, they are regarded as either anomalies to be re-assimilated or diseases to be purged. Therefore, I conclude that the Queen is simply another unincorporated anomaly that spread out of control and became, in essence, a collective within the Collective.

Between accidentally sending Kirk into the mirror universe, creating two Rikers, sending Sisko back into 2024, and other such mistakes that I don’t remember throughout TNG and at least one or two others in DS9, up until “Past Tense”, it seems like even though they’re rare mistakes the seriousness of them should be something that Starfleet at least looks into. 

Is there any canon material that says Starfleet finds these occurrences within acceptable parameters? Like they’re 100% safe or 99% with some “minor” problems? Is there a transporter manual that gives all the potential dangers of transporting? Can’t transport in an ion storm, there just happens to be a singularity going on somewhere in the system, or other such situations that would be hard to control.

startrek,"In VOY: Year of Hell, Part 1, Tom Paris likens the construction of transverse bulkheads throughout Voyager's hull to the watertight bulkheads on the ancient Earth steamship RMS Titanic.

According to Memory Alpha, Year of Hell was filmed in August of 1997, with the scripts presumably being put together just prior. The episode first aired in November 1997.

According to Wikipedia, James Cameron's Titanic began production in 1996, aiming for a July 1997 release date, before eventually slipping to an actual premier in December 1997.

Voyager originally aired on the United Paramount Network (UPN), and Titanic was in part produced and released by Paramount Pictures.

So, two questions:

1. For anyone who watched Year of Hell's initial broadcast: how aware of the Titanic was the general public at this time? As far as I can tell, contemporary common knowledge would mostly have stemmed from the 1958 movie A Night to Remember, and possibly news coverage of Ballard's discovery of the wreckage in 1985. Was this reference to the structural composition of that ship well understood? As someone born in 1993 who didn't start watching Star Trek until 2007, I could so vividly imagine those dramatic watertight door scenes from the film, but I wonder if the same was true prior.

2. Is there any evidence that this was a sly advertisement by Paramount for their major upcoming James Cameron helmed motion picture? Presumably the buzz around the movie would've been out by the beginning of 1997, maybe even a Superbowl commercial, if they we're aiming for a summer release. By the time filming of Year of Hell began in August, the Titanic producers would have committed to the December release, and what better way to entice people to come see your expensive blockbuster than to drop hints into your network shows!

startrek,"V has never been my favorite, nor most people's. But I recently rewatched it with my daughter and I realized that there were a lot of moments that had stuck with me. 

For all the life and death they went through in the other films, some of the most personal moments where in V. It's the only time, that I can recall, that we see the crew on actual out of uniform shore leave. We get to see how they interact with each other when their not on duty or doing anything particularly interesting. 

We learn not only about their families and their losses but how much these experiences effected them personally. When Sybock reveals Spock's pain to him,  Spock's emotional silence is DEVASTATING. All his logic and discipline mean nothing in that moment, and that's what arguing with your brother is like. We learn that they never got over these traumas and probably never will, they just learned to live around them, and they never shared these things with their closest friends. Like real people. 

To this day, when I'm upset about something and someone tries to dismiss it with a platitude, I still remember Kirk saying, ""I don't want my pain taken away from me. I NEED my pain!"" To him, he's not a hero, he's someone who thinks very deeply about pain and loss and death and that's what drives him. He can be cocky and brash on the surface, but underneath he's very aware of the risks he takes. The other movies told us a great deal about WHO Kirk is, I thought V did the best to explain WHY Kirk is.

startrek,"Jake Sisko should have done an investigative report on his fathers actions with the Maquis specifically with regards to the bio bombing of the Maquis colony making it inhabitable to human life and forcing the people living there to mass evacuate with nothing but the clothes on their back. This should have led Jake down a road of further investigating some of his fathers decisions and turning over some very uncomfortable stones. Real Star Trek is a show that displays what intellectual, wise, self actualized adults and societies do to resolve problems in the most humanist/ethical way they can. The themes of the Federation have never been about them or humanity not having problems but how their approach to resolving problems differs from what has been done before without a humanist ideology. Showing how the Federation deals with freedom of the press and a citizens access/right to information was a big missed opportunity.

Next, Captain Sisko should have died with no hint or suggestion of coming back to life or being saved by the Prophets. Arguably DS9's biggest long term theme was ""this is what it takes for the Federation to build and manifest their ideology after the first contact and diplomacy ships leave."" DS9 shows a lot of what it takes including the occasional deaths. Yet none of these deaths have really hit home including Jadzia Dax or Tasha Yar and that's because we know that the actors were leaving the show for personal reasons and it being less about a natural flow of story. But if Sisko really died at the end we would be sitting here and saying DS9 deliberately showed us what kind of hard choices and sacrifices it takes to keep the Federation, this humanist future, going with the lead character of a series.

startrek,"Hello all, 

I have a dilemma (see captivating title). 13 years ago, when I was a youth, I was a dumb kid (see captivating title). I was entrusted with my aunt’s keys so I could come and go while she was gone. I opted to stay at my boyfriend’s a few nights, and was picked up before she returned. When I gave her keys back, she screamed at me. On her keys, was a Ferengi keychain from Star Trek: The Experience, with Rule of Acquisition #21: “Never place friendship before profit” on it. It was gone. Fallen, no doubt, while I was galavanting around as a careless youth. We searched everywhere. His apartment, the parking lot, all of the grounds. She didn’t speak to me for a week. 
Fast Forward: I’ve been searching for this keychain on and off for years with ZERO luck.  With covid-19 coming around, and my aunt and I now both being healthcare workers, I resumed my search, in hopes to brighten out spirits. My sheer chance, I found a seller on Facebook! He mailed me the keychain for a low price. I was ECSTATIC. Unfortunately, it was premature. I received the envelope, but the corner was torn off, and the product was gone. I made many frantic calls to my post office, his, and mail recovery. They don’t hold on to “trinkets”. I’m devastated, folks. So I’m turning to here. And everywhere. To try to find this damn keychain! I have a picture of it, but I can’t figure out how to get it to post. I can tell you that it’s from Star Trek: The Experience. Round. Ferengi. If anyone can help, or share this everywhere, I have all the love for you. I’d pay a pretty penny to bring her a smile! 

Thanks!!

startrek,"I get it - Discovery and Picard are intended to draw more casual fans into the show. And while there's plenty of fan service easter eggs throughout both series with great levels of attention to detail, ignoring certain major canon remains an unacceptable oversight.

1. In Picard, no reference was made of Data's first daughter Lal, or his brother Lore. To me, this detracted from the strength of the overall plot and characters. Heck, Lore played a major part of Hugh's experiences in Descent I and II!

2. While Chabon acknowledged the Dominion War behind-the-scenes, no mention of it was made on-screen in Picard which detracts from the the world building as well as Picard's experiences with evacuating the Romulans, standing up for their rights, etc. Not only does it discredit DS9, but in past Trek shows, references to other not-shown wars and events were often made (Earth-Romulan War, Federation-Cardassian War, World War III, Eugenics War, etc.)

3. Some of Discovery's marketing materials had Burnham listed as ""first black lead"" doing Avery Brooks/Benjamin Sisko a major disservice again to DS9. I can understand if media outlets made this mistake, but CBS and Star Trek themselves shouldn't have.",CBSAA-Trek selectively ignoring certain major canon is an unacceptable oversight.
startrek,"Rewatching this episode post-Picard it’s like they took this one episode and built Picard’s principles around synths for the show from it. 

Maddox says he wants to create “hundreds maybe thousands” of Datas and Picard challenges him to consider that if they are a race how they will be viewed and treated if they are not considered sentient, and how humans will be viewed based on that. 

It is the same argument Picard essentially makes through season 1; to Starfleet after the incident, to Synths, and to Soji. 

And then- Picard himself becomes a synth!

Recently she just finished Discovery and is interested in watching Picard- I told her that she would need to watch at least some TNG and the movies. Do you all agree? She didn’t seem that enthusiastic about 7 seasons and 4 movies before getting into it.

startrek,"Let me start by saying I love Star Trek.  I’ve basically found ways to justify every series and movie.  Yes god had use for a Star ship!  

I enjoyed every series including Enterprise which was just staring to hit its stride when it was canceled.  I love the original series/crew and movies. I liked the first reboot film of this crew as well and felt they could have built a really cool different legacy in the different timeline but was really disappointed by the 2nd one and very meh in the 3rd.  

Kirks crew were part of my childhood and that crew will always be special for me.  If they don’t come back I’m good with it.  It seems a shame the reboot crew never got the 5 year mission(RIP Anton :( ). 

TNG was also amazing and I consumed all of it, including the movies DS9, Voyager.  Recently I watched Picard, and while it’s not TNG, it was nice to see a post TNG world.  It doesnt have the magic that TNG had, but I like some elements of it very much.  I felt like they should have explored 7 of 9 going to the dark side. That moment got me nerd giddy at the possibility of her as the queen. Maybe something for the future.  Also why waste Hugh?...

I’m also not sure I like the daughter, which makes me sad because Data is one of the greatest characters of all time.  Season 2 will be huge.  For me, it made me appreciate TNG because your exploring the Picard and Data missions that are so important to Picards overall story now.  

Now for Discovery...I’m three episodes in and must say.. What am watching here?  Robots on the bridge in this era?  Mind melds create infinite conversations now at anytime? Mutiny?  Firing first?  Those are Klingons?!  What in the Worf am I watching?

Ok I like some things about the gatherings but why do they all sound like they have congestion?  Why are they all bald now?  They are shiny and sparkly now but they lost all the substance and flavor that was so incredible in TNG and DS9 storylines.  

As far as the new crew, not sure what to think of Michael but she’s growing on me.  The rest of the crew is kinda blah for me.  Nobody stands out as of yet, not even tall dude and I always like Doug Jones.  Not feeling this story either.  Hoping it gets better...

So here's a question for you all, what are your favorite costumes from any version of Star Trek, so long as it is not a Starfleet uniform. We'll give it two categories: Federation civilian wear and alien wear/uniforms.  

For me, I'm partial to the khaki jacket/pants combo Bones wore in Star Trek 3 and 4, it having an almost Battlestar Galactica TOS Viper pilot feeling to it for me. For the alien races, I'm also very fond of the Klingon captain's uniform from TNG and DS9, the skirted vest over the armor look works very well.

startrek,"I'm sure this has already been discussed but I just finished Picard last night. I was insanely enthusiastic before the season began and was keeping up week by week for maybe the first 5 episodes. And thats when I started trailing off. Was it just me or was it poorly written throughout the season with almost no character development. With corny love stories and in my opinion a whimsical plot. That being said, I pushed on. Started the Finale last night and I don't even know where to begin with how bad it was. 

1. What the hell was that magic device they all of the sudden acquired that can read your imagination and make anything possible? Where was that the whole time? Or an explanation of how it works? 

2. How is Jean-Luc ""sacrificing"" his life by dying from a condition he's had since TNG? And why was everyone crying when they just knew they had a body ready for him? And if they could do that with Jean-Luc in 5 minutes why had Data been in there for so many years? 

3. I'll combine my last two points into one. When Riker just shows up out of the blue with 200 star ships was so lame. Why the Romulans were just waiting baffled me. Those Orchids weren't enough to stop 218 war birds. Then we finally get to see what we were waiting to see, the synths were coming through the portal and Soji just slams the portal and it closes. Finally, what was that ridiculous scene at the end between Seven and Raffi holding hands? They hardly knew each other. They had, what, 4 minutes of screen time together?

Is there major legal requirements in doing even just that?
---------------------

Anyway here the rough idea and plot:

It's the mid 25th century. Guinan recognized for her wisdom and good counselling is working at the main Starfleet medical unit for mental health as a therapist (yes she had to get certified still) helping officers with anxiety and other emotional challanges.

Guinan goes home to her condo after work in San Francisco and as she is getting ready to sleep, she gets ""a feeling"" something is in the air. She starts looking around the house and doesn't know what's wrong but she knows something is up. Next thing you know, Q shows up

Q says long time no see. They argue a bit about their past (I won't spoil the details here) and then Q reveals why he's there.

Q says the humans continue to advance faster than any of them thought possible and are crutial for future events in the Universe to unfold as they predict (never explains exactly what it is that humans are supposed to accomplish in the far far future). In the shorter term they are also critical to save the galaxy from a more immediate threat both to themselves and the rest of the Federation and Galaxy, the Borg which remain a powerful foe.

In recent decades the Borg not only fully repaired and restored their transwarp network destroyed by Voyager, but are stronger than ever assimilating the galaxy at a rate like never before and humans with the aid of other species and allies in the powerful Federation are the only species both powerful enough but also adaptable and creative enough with solutions to battle such a foe

Q warns that if humanity is gobbled up by the Borg things will not happen as they must. Q reminds Guinan that she knows very well what's at stake for the Universe (once again Q does not specify what he means, but Guinan seems to know what he's talking about)

Guinan begins to argue that the Q continuum should just do something about it and snap the Borg out of existance despite Qs insistance that his hands are tied and the rules from the continuum do not allow him to simply take such a species out of existance just like that without specific rare reasons and that warning humanity on a need to act on the Borg was his only indirect loophole he could take in their destruction (if not destruction, at least partial suppression, or kept under control)

Q states that the reason he chose to contact her of all people is not only because she now has a career and history with Starfleet as a very trusted member that can relay the message and taken seriously, but Guinan also understands what's fundamentally at stake for the future like no one else in the Federation, tho she cannot reveal everything she knows Q is talking about to Starfleet or the Federation

This story I have in mind would not only involve a lot of battle scenes since it's against the Borg... But the story would reveal a lot of mysteries about what the Q are, and what Guinans species fundamentally are too and what their connection with the Q is as well. 

However some details of the history of the Q and Guinan and the El-Aurians and who they fundamentally are would still remain ambiguous. This story would only be a progression in our understanding of those mysterious beings, and further hints that humanity will one day in the far inconceivable future (like Q once told Riker) will one day be a major race not just in the Galaxy but in the Universe and surpass the Q. However again, it will not ruin what that mystery is because the story will only make ambiguous hints, not actually outright reveal everything.

In it, Janeway opens up a resort simulation with holographic beach goers on the holodeck to lure the macroviruses inside. The macroviruses killed the holographic people. And what's more disturbing is that the Doctor went along with it. Now, I know Janeway did this to save her crew from the macroviruses, but still, if a holographic person is capable of sentience, wouldn't what Janeway did be considered genocide?","In Macrocosm, did Janeway commit genocide?"

I'm not gunna lie, I enjoyed it more than First Contact and Insurrection. Although, I'd already seen First Contact when it came out. Insurrection put me to sleep. It was a lot more action packed, but there was some weird immersion breaking stuff.

Like, how did this human clone get so much power? How'd he become a leader of an entire alien race of people in such a short period of time? Why does the slave race, the Remens, have such advanced technology in comparison to the Romulans? Why do the Romulans fear him? Why are the Romulans so nice the the Enterprise at the end?

The series follows the crew of the USS Discovery as they encounter new worlds and civilizations, delving into familiar themes and expanding upon an incident that has been talked about within the franchise's universe, but never fully explored.""

As a preface, I am watching through TNG for the first time and am sharing my running thoughts while watching each episode.

So we start off the episode by learning that the Enterprise is on their way to save 504 severely injured people, and they’re prepared for them all. Holy cow that is just insane to me. I guess I don’t comprehend how large the Enterprise really is. 

Worf pouring out his drink from Q was great. The reasoning was explained as a Klingon code: “Thou shall not drink with thy enemy.” Might have liked it more without the explanation honestly. 

Q’s Penalty Box. Might be a cool name for a bar or maybe a band?

The reason Q goes after Riker instead of Picard is because Q thinks Picard is too competent basically. Riker definitely falls more susceptible to Q’s charm but to be fair his challenge was much more difficult than Picard’s. 

Data once again proved how strong he was when he was tossing cinderblocks like they were foam (which they probably are haha)

Deepest wishes list:

Data - to become human

Wes - to be 10 years older. That’s not what Wil Wheaton looks like irl haha

Geordi - to see. Hey it really is LeVar under that mask!

Worf - wants a Klingon wife. Apparently Klingon sex is crawling?

Riker - wanted Q’s power

All of them rejected these wishes as the human way is to strive for more and earn things themselves. I hate to disagree but I think a lot of people would take their deepest wishes at the snap of a finger. But under those circumstances I can see why they all declined.

“Or second. Time around. So please, a history of the Ji’Zya sector, if you would be so kind.” 

“Ji’Zya sector, location of the first major conflict between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets in the year 2191, has been hotly contested since, with battles occurring most notably in 2212, 2223, and 2245. The last major battle occurred in 2245 at Donatu V, the battle proved just as inconclusive as the prior three. Both the Federation and Klingons lay claim to the worlds within the sector, Donatu V, Sherman’s Planet, and the Gsynerria system. The Federation operates a deep space station, K-7, within the sector, while the Klingons also operate an outpost.”

“Thank you, Mr. Spock. Number One, an update on the Gysnerrian situation, please?”

“Planetary distress calls were sent from the sixth and eighth planets of the system approximately one week ago, they lasted for one day before abruptly ending. Klingon occupation is not suspected, but cannot be ruled out. A dampening field of unknown origin and composition prevents long-range scans.”

“So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. We potentially could be warping into a hot, sticky mess where caution will be king. This ship will ***not*** be the instigator of a full scale war with the Klingon Empire. We will not take any overt aggressive actions, but neither will we allow the Klingons to interfere with our claim on this sector. Shields up, yellow alert. Helm, course 184 mark 22, ahead Warp 6.

Star Trek Picard doesn't necessarily have to be *permanently* set in this post-Nemesis era.  Each season could be set in a different time period (a la Archer jumping around, *but not as absurd*).  We could have a season that covers the Academy years, another season that covers the Stargazer years, and so forth and etc... 

This, I think, would be a perfect way to create more on-screen cannon and explore different aspects of his career in Starfleet.

startrek,"I've noticed a lot of conflicting love and hate remarks with replicators over the series of Star Trek

I remember in TNG when they were carrying the primative farmers the guy loved the whiskey from the replicator. There have also been other times when they praised the quality of the replicators.

But then have also been many instances where characters showed frustration with replicators and their quality

- Tom Paris on the first episode of Voyager was unimpressed with the quality of the tomato soup

- Deanna Troy did not like the ""nutritionally enhanced"" ice cream and wanted real ice cream

- In the new Star Trek Picard they have consistently jabbed at how the the quality of the taste of replicated food is inferior especially in episode 7 when Picard meets Deanna and Riker on the planet

- I also remember the officer who defected to the Maquis in DS9 (forget his name now) sh*t talking how crappy replicator food was like no tomorrow when they were in the shuttle craft


With all the criticism the replicators have had they have also been hailed at times. Would that be from people that don't know real food just like how some kids these days hail frozen food? I remember loving frozen pizza as a little kid for example until tasting REAL Pizza could it be a simmilar thing? But then again the primative man did love the whiskey

Also the fact that they still farm in the future and Picard grows grapes suggests there has so be some kind of demand for real food. If real food wasn't better why farm at all? Or could it be to conserve power?

 We do know that replicators require A LOT of energy (Voyager often had to ration replicators when power reserves were down even more than holodecks). Could it be challanging to supply billions in a planet with replicated food alone so farming was still required?

So I guess I'm asking 2 questions here. Is their quality truly inferior to real food? and why farm still if food can be replicated? Thoughts",Replicators... Loved Or Hated? Why?
startrek,"I have been a Star Trek Fan since I was 9 years old. It started with my dad whatching Star Trek Voyager which I was instantly hooked on. I rewhatched every re-run of Voyager constantly and years later once streaming online became a thing started whatching it yet again

I did branch out into other Star Treks too. The Next Generation was the second one I whatched which I really liked as well (tho not as much as Voyager at the time), then Star Trek Enterprise when it came out, eventually I gave Deep Space 9 a chance even tho I innitially refused to whatch it finding it boring (I honestly think now its actually my favorite) and I've whatched every movie (all 13 both from TOS and The Next Generation and the new modern ones), and the new series Discovery and Picard (I love Picard btw) but it all started with Voyager

But the last several years I have an ever growing love/hate relationship with Voyager each time I give it a little whatch and now as I got older (I'm turning 27 in a month) because in many ways it seems like the most badly done of all the star treks and I'm sorry but I'm about to go on a rant:

#1 Captain Janeway can't act to save her life. It was especially bad in the first couple seasons. She was very stiff and very extra and her lines seemed so forced. It did get better in the later seasons but only ""acceptable"" she never became great in my opinion

#2 The characters and cast were super dry. Harry Kim, Kes &amp; Chakotay were literally plain dry toast with no personality. Tuvok gets a pass because Vulcans are supposed to be that way but when half the cast is already boring to begin with adding a lifeless Vulcan makes it intolerable. The characters all were overly formal and sounded over rehearsed

The characters that DID have personality often had the other extreme of having too much like they were making up for the lifeless cast. Neelix and the Doctor in particular were way too extra. Between Chakotay, Kes, Harry and Tuvok being too dry, Neelix &amp; the Doctor being too extra, and Captain Janeway being a terrible actress... Tom Paris is the only character I tolerated and Balana Torris and 7 of 9 the only 2 characters I genuinely liked

#3 They constantly threw obvious issues under the rug when they didn't want to deal with it in the plot. As if it wasnt obvious that there's no way for example that the Maquis crew would blend in so nearly perfectly into a Starfleet crew with minimal problems for example. Yeah a couple episodes early on touched on the tension between the crew but they moved on unrealistically quickly from that.

#4 the contradictions never end. Whether it's the limited number of torpedoes they supposibly had never running out despite use all series long without them ever explaining how they overcame the problem of their production, or there being enough deaths over the entire series to kill a limited sized crew that can't be replaced 2 times over. Like come on


It also got on my nerves to see Neelix and Kes so frequently in senior officers meetings. Like why is the Chef/Cook and trainee nurse always there? Just cuz they are part of the main cast doesn't mean u gotta throw them in when it doesn't make sense.

Basically as a huge trekie that first got introduced to the Star Trek Universe (and science fiction in general) thanks to Star Trek Voyager, and considered it my fav show in general, I now consider it one of the weakest if not the most poorly done of all the Star Trek series (excluding obvious shortcoming like TOS graphics of the times obviously)

I will say that at least it had my favourite looking ship and I did like the frequent encounters with the Borg if that counts for anything",As An Old Star Trek Fan Looking Back... Voyager Gets On My Nerves
startrek,"*Discussing: S01E02, ""Yesteryear"" from the 1970s animated series.*

In the episode, adult Spock saves the child version of himself by going into the past. The episode claims that if adult Spock didn't save the child version of him via time travel, then Spock would have died young and never grown up to join the Starship Enterprise.

How is that possible? If the only way for young Spock to live is through an adult Spock saving him, then without adult Spock he would never grow old to become adult Spock??

Anyways, is it me or does the technology between TOS and TNG onwards seem rather similar? They're set a hundred years apart. Think about the technology in the 1910s and 1920s, now think about technology in 2020. Why does it seem that TOS's gizmos are merely a bulkier and maybe a bit obsolete version of TNG's? In 1920 planes were biplane and cloth covered machines of death, we didn't have computers nor the internet, nevermind AI, nanotechnology and a myriadof other sciences.

startrek,"I'll start with the positive. I actually think it is a really good double episode.

Why is it, though, that it always has to be Janeway who is the hero?

I also love the way this was set up seasons ago with the Kes episode where she is going backwards in time.

Still, a couple of things:

1) Didn't Kes tell them what the frequency was? I know she did as she moved backwards in time, but surely she would have told them as she started moving forwards. Yes. I know they said certain things should not be disclosed, but why would they not disclose the frequency of the torpedo?

2) Obviously there was a change in that now it was Seven that finally found the frequency and not Kes... I guess this is just showing different possible timelines.","Voyager ""The Year of Hell"""
startrek,"
There is a major difference between DS9’s darkness and Discovery’s/Picard’s darkness. DS9 treated its serious topics seriously. During that episode where Obrian was implanted with fake memories, O’Brien’s experience as a prisoner is taken seriously, and his prison lifestyle, his increased agitation and his inability to change or move on nearly makes him commit suicide. All of this is taken seriously. When Nog came back after loosing his leg at the siege of AR-558, he essentially had PTSD, and sealed himself away in a holosuite with Fontaine to get away from everything. The topic isn’t joked about, glorified, or just used casually, it is a serious matter taken seriously by the show. Speaking of, the Siege of AR-558 isn’t some Vietnam war movie, where their mowing down the Vietcong with a machine gun mounted to a Huey. It is a horrible thing, where people die, where Nog, a person close to being a child, loses his leg. It’s dirty, it’s grim, it’s dark, but most importantly it was serious. In fact, Star trek’s worst episodes were when they didn’t take topics or themselves seriously, take Profit and Lace, Code of honor, etc.

Nutrek however doesn’t take anything seriously. Suicide is just referenced casually(“why didn’t I just put a phaser to my head and end it all?”-Seven of Nine “I think about suicide every day”-Agnes and I think there are at least three scenes of suicide). While you would think ptsd would be taken seriously, notably Picard’s with the borg, its forgotten about after a few minutes. If modern producers made DS9, we would have seen a 2 minute scene of Bashir fucking butchering Nogs leg and then another two minute scene of the fake leg being shoved up the gored leg, but since the show was mature, it didn’t glorify violence. DS9 didn’t want violence to happen, it was still Star Trek, when battles were shown it was a struggle and during Sacrifice of angels, getting back DS9 was almost a phyrric victory, and when they finally won and were on Cardasia, only Martok drank, while Sisko(who would have, out of anyone, a justifiable hatred for Cardasians) says, “That May be the case, but that does not mean I have to toast over their dead bodies.” Meanwhile in Discovery, “I want to here you scream”. When DS9 talked about means to an end, such as in the pale moonlight, the entire episode is devoted to the topic. It deals with the struggle of the people involved and the sacrifices you have to make to save lives, even if they seem immoral. Discovery went, “ACTION! IM GONNA FUCKING STAB YOU, FUCK YOOOOOOOU” and then realized they needed to have a, “moral dilemma” so they placed a bomb on Qo’noS and then had Michael go, “we cAn’T BloW UP ThE planeT, tHERE’s liKe, PeOplE HEre anD StuFf.” It makes me sad to see that something made by Seth Macfarland takes more seriousness than an official Star Trek production.",Why darkness worked in DS9 and why I’m sick of hearing it as an excuse
startrek,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Star Trek Picard and the Star Trek fandom as a whole a lot lately, and I realized that so many feel that they either have to love something unconditionally or hate it. As a life long Star Trek fan, I’m only a teen but my dad got me started on TNG when I was 4/5, I really liked Star Trek Picard. It did have two outstanding flaws in my opinion, however. 

Flaw 1 is simpler to explain, the show was just paced extremely weird, the first 3 episodes felt like they could fit into one, yet later episodes felt like they would benefit from being allocated more time. Using extra time gained from tinkering the pacing could be used to insert some more Trekky character moments that a lot of people, including my self, want. 

Flaw 2 is more broad. There were a lot of really, really, really, really stupid decisions. These decisions didn’t have much of an impact on story imo, but just generally felt out of place. Examples of these for me would be the overabundance of Disco style shuttles, the copy paste fleet in the Finale, the death of Hugh, the overly grotesque Icheb scene, etc. As I said, these don’t really impact the story, and some, for me the Icheb scene, didn’t strike me as all that bad, but looking back on these areas, it seems like they were either just lazy and asking for backlash. 

Overall, however, I liked Picard and like New Star Trek as a whole. I just hope future series put some work into the whole pacing thing and I really think Picard going forward and Disco going forward may begin to compare to some of the greatest sci fi ahows(DS9, Babylon 5, and the new Battlestar)",My take on Picard.

So my question comes from what I'm familiar with from TNG to DS9 since that is what I saw when I was a child (tells you my age). Is it possible that V'Ger possibly created or encountered the Borg before it's contact with Kirk and company? Because of the fact what V'Ger went through and all it's data it has on everything it has encountered, I would hypothesize that it had to have encountered them at one point or another.",Question concerning the First movie

startrek,"I haven't thought through all the details but I was thinking about something with the best of both worlds so how about something that really pushes the boundaries of interstellar travel - some sort of huge starship which is a cross federation crew and science mission to go much further than ever before - perhaps to try to plant transwarp conduits, but the key is to go far further outside of the space we have ever seen before, something truly weird and alien that really requires a show of the scope of the sheer size of space. A multi species crew, an enterprise-y set up but a travelling ship of new design that is almost as much a travelling space station as it is a ship that can be part home, part factory, part base for scout ships - perhaps it's even longer, a ten year mission - something that really evokes going into the unknown like the Apollo program - but to add contrast you also have b plots set in the closer to home areas on earth or thereabouts dealing with federation politics and research and so on that can involve returning characters and smaller b plots. Perhaps the base station that is running the mission, geordi la forge and miles o Brien are running the program from earth, problems have to be solved from a distance like a mission control, and human stories as earth advances with other programs and politics. Haven't thought much more but any ideas to flesh it out welcome. Partly inspired by a pic I saw of a huge fantasy starship with a a saucer but just a huge block behind that felt like it could be some sort of huge monolithic Starfleet design.

startrek,"Noob Trek 46 - A Piece Of The Action

My first thought was ""what a weird title"". It was evocative of nothing without any context, and I knew nothing about this episode going in.

And I'm glad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times and I mean that in a good way. After episodes like I Mudd, I thought I'd seen it all but this was another delightful curveball I never saw coming. Man, ANYTHING can happen on this show can't it?

Right away something's off when Kirk's asked to meet Okmyx (whose name I originally misheard as Ox Mix, which was interesting) by the ""yellow fire plug"". The contrast in tech between the Enterprise and the Ioatians is funny off the bat. And then bam, we're in a 1930's gangster film (though there's a lot of influences from 30s/40s crime cinema, Little Caesar seems to be a particular reference here.) And it's a great job too, with the thug actors hamming it up, and drivebys, fistfights, cards, even some molls. Integrating the sci-fi elements with this would seem to be a tall order, but it's an ingenious and really interesting premise - a starship crew left behind a book on earth history dealing with the Chicago mob era, the primitive locals became fascinated with it as an artifact of an advanced race, and modeled their civilization on it, it becomes their bible as McCoy says.

Anthony Caruso does a great job as crime boss Okmyx, but it kept bugging me - I'm sure I've seen him before, the name/face is familiar but I can't place it. Little touches, such as how the Federation are referred to ""the feds"" are hilarious . The sets are particularly good, and as a pinball nut I appreciated how they have some oldtime pinball machines in the gangster's rec room. When Kirk plays Calvinball with the cards appears to be when the episode just full on embraces the silliness and becomes an outright comedy. On the one hand I was a little miffed at the potentially serious side of the story which illustrates the importance of the prime directive being forgotten, but what we get is funny enough that I forgive it.

""What are the odds of getting a royal fizbin?""

""I've never computed them captain.""

Elements such as Jojo Krako's ""boss"" plaque and his dartboard of Okmyx make it clear that the show is in on the joke. I was laughing out loud when Spock and Kirk make the scene fully decked out as gangsters, and it's side splitting how ""Koik"" gradually turns into Edward G Robinson with ""Spocko"" reluctantly getting on the act (""I advise yas to keep diallin'"") and I was rolling in the aisles when he accidentally sends the car into reverse. It's great that legendary starship captain James T Kirk doesn't know how to drive. Even Scotty gets to threaten to put someone in concrete galoshes. Things just get nuttier and nuttier in this one.

The coda at the end of the episode even ties up the loose ends, as I was just thinking that how Kirk left things was irresponsible. I'm cutting myself short here - there's lots of other fun little moments I could type up but I won't be able to do them justice. A really pleasant surprise - when I realised what this episode was doing I was afraid it was going to be embarrassing but I couldn't have been more wrong.

We see the return of the Ferengi in this episode. Our first repeat alien species. Let’s dig in!

So Daimon Bok is immediately untrustworthy and yet they invite him on their ship. Isn’t there some sort of captain’s videoconferencing they can do? Social distancing, people!

We learned that the common cold has been cured. Their medical practices are obviously incredible if Dr. Crusher is so concerned about a headache. 

Captain Picard’s old ship, the Stargazer, was introduced to us. Apparently he destroyed a Ferengi ship with it after it attacked him.

I just saw Star trek The Motion Picture, which I tremendously enjoyed, it's like a short story by Asimov (reminds me a bit of ""The Last Question""), the pacing drags a bit in the beginning, the film could do with 10 or 20 minutes less, but overall it was great. I'm just left wondering, could what the new species that Decker and Vger turn into at the end of the film, be the Q continuum? The Q did say they once were like humans, they see to know everything, just like Vger, and Spock even says at the end that the last thing Vger learned was emotions, the Q with all their superiority seem to be highly emotional beings, heck, they even look human.

startrek,"Now I haven't watched all the movies yet so don't spoil those for me please lol

Ok so I think I just have to share a bit of my thoughts and confusions

- I ended on the original series, now I liked the ending but it didn't really feel like a finale it felt more of just a normal episode which is wierd

- everyone I know that has watched a lot of star trek and I am just curious why most people don't like enterprise, like it's not my favorite or anything but I enjoyed it but most people seem to just be content with it and I can't seem to figure out why

- I think Voyager might have been my favorite but I don't know for sure I really liked them all

- the ending of Voyager was very strange as they got back to earth and that was it and the show ended right then and there with no like epilogue I guess, like what happened to everyone?

- I really liked ds9 as it felt different since it was on a station instead of a ship

- I have absolutely no complaints about TNG I really enjoyed it but it didn't seem to have a big overarching story that was shown a lot (I like big stories because they make me feel like there is something being built up to like I'm Voyager) but I did like all the episodes by themselves and it seems like a great show to just turn on anytime on any episode and pick up in the plot easily

- I doubt there is an explanation for this but why did kayless in the original series show up as a genetically altered Klingon?

Ok I have more thoughts that I can't think of as I am bad at writing my opinions well, I haven't been on this sub long so I don't know if is should make a post like this. Also I wierd thing I noticed was that all of these shows were aired before I was born except near the end of Enterprise (I'm only 15)

I'd love to hear what you all have to think about all this and I wanna know if Discovery and Picard are worth watching so I can know if I should try to get all access or not

But on the other hand she does seem like a better actor (Atleast for the first 1-2 seasons), but maybe that would only show on TNG bc of the circumstances (ie being on a Galaxy Class ship VS dealing with the myriad of non-federation factions from the deck of a space station).

startrek,"Noob Trek 44 - The Trouble With Tribbles

I know this episode! At least I know it's premise. I don't know \*how\* I know this - I've certainly never seen it before as I had seen no Trek before beginning this marathon - but I knew the basic story before watching it, that the Enterprise becomes overrun with a bunch of seemingly harmless fluffballs called Tribbles that breed lightning fast. Racking my brain, I \*think\* I'm aware of this because I was a huge fan of Gremlins, and this was cited as an influence on that.

I love the misdirection at the beginning. This entire episode is a bait and switch - we're lead to expect a confrontation with the klingons, with a whole bunch of politics and protocol and posturing upfront. Kind of like I Mudd, which has a dry opening before becoming very silly indeed, this also goes for a gradual and entirely deliberate 180 in tone. The gag is of course that the silly little tribbles come closer to causing mission failure on the part of Kirk than the aggressive warlike Klingons ever have. The I Mudd comparisons are Apt - this in fact feels like a Mudd episode. I wouldn't be surprised if it was written as one and Carmel was unavailable or something, Cyrano feels like a Mudd stand in. I don't mind Stanley Adamas as Cyrano, he's fine, and does well in the bar fight scene as he amusingly enjoys his drinks while everything goes to hell around him, but I think Carmel might have done it even better.

I recognize Trelane, William Campbell from Squire Of Gothos immediately. Much as I like Campbell though, he feels miscast as a Klington, much too arch and spry. It would have been nice to bring back Kor from Errand Of Mercy and have Kor and Mudd team up and possibly have their own spin off together. In fact, to my surprise, the Klingons seem to be getting \*less\* like the klingons I know with each appearance. In Errand Of Mercy they had makeup and more of a sense of an alien culture, in Friday's Child they just looked like people and now in The Trouble With Tribbles they look like people and behave a lot like them too. I suppose the lack of makeup is actually a plot point here for Darvin to pass as a human, but still, I like my Klingons like I like my coffee - not closely resembling a human being.

This episode is absolutely packed with quotable lines, so many I don't think I can even list them all.  ""My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee"" stands out. A lot of them come from Kirk squaring off with Baris - something about Baris just rubs Kirk the wrong way - maybe because he's a bureaucrat who doesn't appreciate the military wing of Starfleet and thinks it is just there to serve him. In any event, Kirk suddenly transforms into a class clown, firing off zingers every time Baris appears on the screen. Kirk doesn't have all the laughs though, one of my favourite moments was Spock boasting of how Vulcans are immune to the charms of tribbles as he begins to stroke one. I also loved how Scotty didn't mind all the insults about Kirk, but as soon as someone has a go at his ship he's ready to fight. ""I'm sorry, the Enterprise shouldn't tow garbage, it should be towed as garbage"" was pretty good too. This also leads into the interesting sight of Kirk dressing down his men for a ""small disturbance"" and leads into this classic exchange:

Scotty: They said you were an overbearing swaggering dictator with illusions of godhood.

Kirk: Is that all?

Other favourite moments are Kirk sitting on the tribble in his command chair, and of course what I now know to the iconic scene of Kirk becoming buried in tribbles. It's not dwelt on as this is a humorous story, but it was nice to see a serious side brought in, as there are ecological undercurrents to Spock explaining to Cyrano the dangers of removing animals from their natural habitats. If Spock is correct though, that means the tribbles live on a badass planet where they get killed all the time - do we ever go there?

Gripes? No shot of Campbell on the klingon ship overrun with tribbles, boo, I really wanted that. Also it's a bit slow - things like the barfight and dressing down, while entertaining, seemed to run long and there wasn't as much tribble insanity as I wanted - this may be due to the tribbles needing to be stationary for production reasons, so when they're just lying there they can't do that much. Finally, is Baris right? Didn't Kirk actually goof up by letting grain get destroyed? That it's poisoned is beside the point, Kirk still failed to defend it despite him knowing that tribbles were about.

However, I still really liked it, plenty of laugh out loud moments, and unlike I Mudd which was just nuts, this has a decent stab at combining a regular, sober Star Trek setting/story with the wacky hi-jinks, giving it a different sort of flavour which I appreciated. I hope we see the tribbles again soon!","""The Trouble With Tribbles"" - First Time Viewing Reaction"
startrek,"I mean they literally send the Enterprise to negotiate every dispute at the neutral zone, even though any one of them could result in a full scale war. How incompetent can Starfleet be? Yeah it's the most advanced ship but they're putting families and children in unnecessary danger. I know a lot of the plotholes with regards to this have been pointed out before and most are chalked up to Starfleet's hubris, but there's a fine line between hubris and utter idiocy and Starfleet must have discovered transwarp a couple years early to get as far past that line as they did. It also reflects really poorly on the crew.


For example in the Descent two patter Beverly acting as captain flys the Enterprise into a sun, A SUN! Without knowing if the expirimental shielding will hold, it's okay to take a risk like this if your on a ship with your own crew, but if there are children aboard with their families, it's the type of risk you shouldn't really be taking.


I just needed to get this off my chest. I know the writers have said that they regret that aspect of the Enterprise D but damn, they basically avoid the semantics of it in every episode until they decide they need it as a plot device.


Thinking about this does however add a lot of weight to some of the decisions made in the show. For example at the end of 'Best of Both Worlds', right before Data is about to free Picard from the Collective, Riker is about to warp the Enterprise into the Borg Cube to ensure the safety of humanity. It seems like this really big decision when you realise he's about to sacrifice his whole crew to save humanity. But it shows he's got some iron clad balls when you realise he's about to sacrifice every innocent civilian on the Enterprise and in the circumstances its unfortunately probably the right decision.


But yeah, Starfleet are idiots.",Just a reminder that

""Who Watches the Watchers"" is becoming one of my favorite episodes; I find the scenes between Picard and Nuria very moving. The plot bears some thematic similarity to the poignance of Galaxy Quest.

&amp;nbsp;

On my most recent watch, I noticed that there are a few strange parallels between Ray Wise's character, Liko, and his character on Twin Peaks, Leland Palmer. Beyond the minor sound-similarity of the names, both characters interact with otherworldly beings and experience inexplicable and seemingly supernatural events, which change their lives and make them stand apart in their communities. Liko's only relative is his daughter, and he mourns his late wife, obsessing over Picard's power to revive the dead, while Leland obsessively mourns his dead daughter. What's more, in TNG there's a lot of hubbub about the stranded anthropologist, ""Palmer,"" (cf. the Palmer family) whom Liko heard Picard mention in his experience in Enterprise sickbay. 

&amp;nbsp;

The episode aired on October 6th, 1989. Twin Peaks premiered on April 8th, 1990.

startrek,"S1E7 - Justice

I thought this episode was sort of boring. Not too much happened. But let’s get to it. 

If a world or situation seems too good to be true, it probably is. Thankfully Picard seemed aware of that right off the bat when dealing with Edo. 

There was a lot of discussion about the Edo people including their social practices but they left out the most important thing somehow in their studies because they didn’t learn about their punishment? It doesn’t really make sense that they wouldn’t know about their capital punishment policy. Also they were talking about sexual these Edo people are and yet they still send Wesley who is immediately overwhelmed and gets himself in trouble.

What are the benefits to their idea that any one who commits any crime is executed? Well it saves costs on the justice system and prisons I suppose. Edo’s entire justice system is apparently two Mediators running up to you and slipping you some night-night juice. Quick and easy. On the downside, it’s incredibly unfair. 

That had to be quite the amazing experience for the girl from Edo to be able to see her God up close. I’m surprised she was even able to speak. 

Also I had an alternative solution for the Enterprise to use. Why not dress up one of crew as their “God” in human form. Maybe Geordi in disguise could do this. Then just beam him down and demand the release of Wes?

Overall, I felt the message of the episode was summarized well by Riker at the end: “When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?”. This is why each situation is handled case-by-case and not every outcome will be the same.",Star Trek TNG S1E7 Discussion

startrek,"Even though I’m new to the universe I’ve heard at or around 4 is when the show really kicks in to gear. But honestly what the actual f*** is going on before then? TNG had a reason for not being serialized and I suppose at least in the beginning DS9 needed to get everything set up before but by mid season 2 we know the characters and what’s going on. So WHAT THE F*** IS GOING ON?! 

Just watched episodes 14-16 of season 2 and they’re so disconnected and leave so many questions unanswered that I feel are kinda important to the story or at least to character development. 14 is when Bashir and O’Brian are supposedly killed in a planets attempt to stop civil war and they know about some bioweapon. 15 is when O’Brian is running from the station because everyone is acting weird. And 16 I’m in the middle of but just from the first few minutes I’m once again just like what the hell! 

Are the people from episode 14 coming back since Bashir and Brian were rescued by Sisko? They were adamant on killing them, even Sisko, because they know too much. Would they attack the station and start a war with the federation?

Episode 15 who are the Paradons, sorry if that’s spelled wrong, and how did Brian end up with the rebels? What happened when he was with the actual government? What are the rebels rebelling against? Were they negotiating peace with the rebels or another species? What about the rebels makes them more appropriate allies than the government? 

Episode 16 they just ignore everything that happened in the previous ones. Sure the Brian in the last episode was a “replicant” so anything that happened that we saw was not the actual perspective but still it seemed like everyone was against Brian and then boom this episode everything is just fine. 

I get it I do, none of that happened, and with the benefit of Netflix we don’t need to wait a week and that means no real disconnect that didn’t exist when the episode released. It’s still just so frustrating. We’re just supposed to accept that everything happened but also has no lasting impact on anything or anyone.

All that would of had to happen is the doctor instantly getting to work to keep them all from mutating. But is that really all thy hard? It seems clear in the episode that the longer you wait to treat it the more effort it takes but it’s never impossible. And once they are safe in earth orbit they can use the dozens of ship warp cores to quickly treat everyone and then there’s nothing else to worry about it.  So i see no reason why they wouldn’t use it if it works.,Why wasent warp 10 a usable way home for voyager?
startrek,"Picard season one was, in my opinion, pretty damn good. My only complaint with it would be just how focused it was on the concept of AI, while I agree that AI is something that people need to start talking about  the story itself wasn’t very Star Trek centric and I don’t feel that it properly explored Star Treks vast pre-existing universe. I don’t mind pre-existing lore not being the center of a Star Trek Story as I don’t think Star Trek should be an exclusionary lore circle-jerk, but I do want to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe. 


With Picard de-canonizing almost all of the lore for what’s happened after nemesis by its very nature, I’d love to get to see what’s happened to the rest of the universe, particularly what’s going on with some of the DS9 centric powers. I’d love to get to see Star Trek Picard season 2 show us a Bajor that’s either parted ways with the federation or straight out joined it, or a democratic Cardassia. What about the rest of the Romulan people, obviously some sort of government exists if the tal-shiar and Zhat-Vash still exist, what’s that like?

William Shatner has been the butt of many jokes over the years, and has gained.. a.. certain reputation........ for his style, but look at the era and his background.

TOS was hot off the heals of so many classic dramatic and adventure films, and seems to have taken inspiration from a lot of the myth and epic movies before it, like *Jason and the Argonauts*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Hercules*.

We discovered that the Enterprise crew does not eat meat! I suppose that makes sense. Where would they keep the animals? Also on the topic of food, it was interesting to hear discussion about accommodating dietary requirements for the aliens that are visiting your ship. 

When the ship ‘malfunctioned’, Data says it’s a near impossible chance of this happening (from normal wear and tear). Good to know how good Star Fleet engineering is. Systems just do not fail on their own. 

As I side note I really liked the design of the Anticans. Haven’t seen them before. 

The discussion about private eyes and detective work was fun. Each episode of Star Trek is a mystery! That’s part of why we all tune in. Also Detective Data is my favorite Data so far. 

I can’t believe they killed off Singh in Engineering! Farewell, our plot necessary casualty. We knew you but for a minute.

They had five full movies worth of run time for Picard and I don't think they satisfyingly developed a single character in this supposedly character driven show. Narek and Soji bang within about five minutes of meeting on the cube and despite liking to have sex with each other being just about all they seem to have in common, I guess Narek loves her by episode five which couldn't be more than a couple of weeks in their time assuming the first time we see Soji at the end of episode one is when Picard sets off to find her.

How they introduced Raffi feels a lot like how Mr Poopeybutthole is shown to apparently have been a real character that participated in past events in Rick and Morty. I get that it makes sense that there would be people Picard would have met in the past couple of decades, but that level of chuminess and amount of inferred history really felt awkward to me for a character we'd never seen before. That quickly glossed over backstory coupled with how quickly they also introduce Raffi's son and move past it and then her very sudden apparent relationship with 7 makes it feel almost like parody levels of ridiculous.

The evil Soji/Dajh character at the end with the Data skin I felt must have had about ten total minutes of screen time(maybe it was more, I think my eyes glazed over and I lost all sense of reality at multiple points watching this show) and yet she ends up being one of the most important antagonists. These synthetics are apparently insanely intelligent and her most of all considering she just randomly deduced that the warning to biological organisms might actually be a message to synthetics and had the ability to mind meld, but she wasn't smart enough to avoid being recorded stabbing her sister.

Agnes is so affected by what she saw through the mind meld that she murders the person she loves most in this world and then later in the series gambles that the synthetics will do the right thing and not genocide all life in the galaxy and helps to save them instead. I guess you could say her speaking to Soji for five minutes that one time could've helped change her mind, but it still seems strange that a character would do such a distinct 180.

There's hardly a real arc for anyone and what arcs there are make little sense or I just find fairly boring. Soji, a few days after finding out she's an android, wants to bring about armageddon for organic life, but then decides not to because I guess Picard was cool to her. Agnes flip flops like I mentioned before between being horrified enough to murder and then potentially making that murder pointless a few days later. Rios is depressed about the incident with the other synthetics and his captain's suicide and then I guess gets over it? No one else really has a significant arc of any kind that I can remember. Elnor starts off as a comic relief ninja and ends that way. 7 starts off as a now nihilistically mooded fanservice Mary Sue and ends that way. Narissa starts off as the wicked witch of the cube and ends that way(well she ends up supposedly dead, but she'll probably be back in season 2 considering we don't see her die as far as I remember). I guess Picard learned to express himself more?

I understand full well why people here really want to like this show. I very much wanted to as well and really did try up until a little past halfway through and while there are technical aspects to like(minus the stock footage), I don't see how anyone can really claim that the creators of this series had a firm grasp on what people want out of Star Trek or competent storytelling in general. Now I expect very much to get flamed here because I know people here did genuinely enjoy this first season and are getting really tired of people like me, and so I just ask that you tell me what it is that you enjoyed about it if you're in that camp. It might be that in a few years I look back and think I was too harsh on the show. It happened recently with me with Enterprise and hopefully it will happen here too, but at least right now I'm really cold on this series.",Thoughts on Star Trek: Picard's character development

startrek,"I've always had the head canon that Picard switched to his grey jumper with the red captain's coat to (aside from make him look hella fresh) help a captain assimilate as it were with the general population of the crew within his down time, in an attempt by Starfleet to reduce the personal barriers that would exist between the crew and the authority figure of the Captain so as to make it easier for the Captain to create a more informal relationship with his crew, when the coat is off that is. But when it comes to the other changes I've always wondered why they make them. It could be something as simple as some Starfleet officer designing a new uniform that people like, but is there a reason beyond that? For example they've always maintained the use of primary colours to denote the three types of crewmen but for some reason they decided at some point that red was more befitting of command than yellow.

I enjoyed this episode! It gave us more good development, an intriguing storyline and some philosophy. Let’s dig in. 

Kosinski keeps saying he’s got everything approved from star fleet commmand. Is there no way for the Enterprise to verify that? Who does the Enterprise get their orders from?

Last episode we Geordi so excited to go Warp 9, which made me think it was the fastest the ship could go. Turns out it wasn’t. They broke the all-time speed record by going “over warp 10”. It feels nice to witness some Star Trek history. 

There was some interesting philosophical discussions about time, space, and thought all being the same thing. It’s an interesting concept that I can’t say I’ve thought of before. Only issue is space is tangible. We’ve been there. It’s unlike the other two in that way. Not sure where I’m going with that, but there’s a discussion in there somewhere. 

We got shown more of Yar’s rape gang backstory. Apparently she stopped for a cat while running from one of those gangs? I mean, okay? On the flip side there was a nice moment with Picard and his mom. It seemed like they had a good relationship. 

There was certainly an urge at first to explore but I thought Picard shut it down perfectly and logically. The interaction was something along the lines of: “So many opportunities for new studies!” “But who would we report our findings to?”

I really liked how they handled Wesley’s promotion. Having the alien tell Picard he really is a savant but that he needs time to learn is a solid way to justify promoting such a young kid. So now we have Wesley, Acting Ensign, who has an opportunity to become permanent, which is cool. 

Felt like the overall theme of the episode was that when we all work together towards a common goal we can break records. We can accomplish great things as a team. Picard got everyone on the ship to focus on The Traveler and getting them home and because of that they were able to return.",Star Trek TNG S1E5 Discussion
startrek,"Dear Michael Chabon: How can you make Trek, and not be a starship guy? Star Trek has always been a show about starships. The *Enterprise* is a major character in each of the respective series, along with the *Defiant*, and *Voyager*. Much attention to detail was given to producing these and other background ships on the older shows, and I wish that could be the case for Picard and Discovery, but it hasn't. It's disappointing a bit to see the poor quality of ships in Discovery, and Picard repsectively, and I hope that this can be corrected going forward with the next seasons of these shows.

startrek,"I subscribed to CBS All Access to finally see Discovery and Picard. When I saw the previews of Discovery I was off put by the overdone graphics and the total remake of the klingons. I have finished just season one of Discovery and I have been pleasantly surprised. I had fun, I like the characters for the most part, and it is an interesting take on Trek. Some of the graphics are still a bit over the top for me with all the colors and lens flares and darkness. It somewhat feels like video game graphics. I still think the remastered TNG graphics are perfect. I do understand it can be a matter of personal opinion. I look forward to seeing season two. 

Picard ... I am five episodes in and I feel like I am watching it out of loyalty and excitement to see the old characters again.  I am not saying it is bad, but I feel  like I am not having fun.

Did the writers forget about one of their main characters, Narek?? Why would they force Picard’s consciousness back into a corporeal form when he had never asked for something like that and was seemingly at the natural end of his life?? Why would Seven and Raffi be a “thing”, theyve never met eachother and both characters were set up as super standoffish, who probably wouldn’t lock hands intimately with someone they barely know??

startrek,"Basically I've had this idea brewing in my mind for years for some Star Trek show of my own and since I'm a screenwriter I'm actually at the point of trying to create this show in script form (only in the middle of the first episode in terms of actual scriptwriting but I have a whole potential S1 outlined) and I'd hate for this to go to waste as the most effort put into fanfic ever so I really want to pitch this show. However, not only am I a relative ""fresh face"" in the screenwriting world but I'm worried that since they've already got all this Star Trek planned they might not think there's room for one more (especially when most of the ideas come from someone with my lack of stature) and I'm also worried about breaking some rule a lot of people see as integral to Star Trek but I disagree; people think ""humanity has evolved beyond religion"" in Star Trek but I plan to show (if I can) practitioners of Abrahamic faiths (specifically a Jew and a Muslim on the same bridge to make the same point about peace TOS was making with Sulu and Chekov) because I believe there is in-show mention of religion still being prominent

startrek,"Somehow I missed this episode when it first aired on TV. I just watched it on Amazon Prime this evening.

This is one of the few VOY episodes I can remember that actually has any moral complexity. We've seen a lot of variations of 'shipwrecked survivors found stranded on a planet' in Star Trek, but them being ex-Borg is a nice touch. 

The Cooperative puppeteer Chakotay to go to the damaged Borg cube and restart their link. They violate his autonomy; however, it could be argued it was an extreme circumstance as their rivals were literally beating down their doors to kill them.

On the other hand, Janeway has some good points about why they shouldn't assist the Cooperative in their plans. Firstly, assisting ex-Borg to form their own collective is just hinky. There is no indication that the other stranded ex-Borg on the planet even wanted to collectivize. Then again, if they don't, they all seem hellbent on destroying one another. Janeway's point about the restarted Borg cube possibly summoning other Borg cubes is a good point; one can only hope the Cooperative was able to block the Borg on it from signalling the other Borg. I mean, we have no proof they can do that, but maybe? Otherwise, all they would've accomplished was to bring the Borg right back to them, so I suppose they had thought of that and had a way to stop those Borg.

Also, exploding the Borg cube is basically murder, especially as we know those drones could be disconnected from the collective and reestablish their own identities, just like the colonists on the planet. However, it's arguably necessary to destroy them to prevent them from assimilating and/or destroying Voyager and the colonists.

It would be interesting to see what became of this Cooperative. If they make it to a second generation (and I don't see why not; there's an episode where the Doctor notes Seven is still fertile, implying the Borg don't sterilize their drones) their children won't have the implants necessary for the link. Will they still maintain their idyllic little hippie oneness colony? 

Out of the aliens in the episode, aside from Orum (Romulan) and Frazier (human), one of the Cooperative has facial ridges just like Archer's great-granddaughter in that ""E2"" episode. Is she Ikaaran? One of the attackers seems to be a Nausicaan. The others may be exotic Delta Quadrant species I'm unfamiliar with.","VOY: ""Unity"""
startrek,"For starters I’ll just say this might become quite a long post, and I know the new films are incredibly divisive, but that just means you get a better debate and comparing of ideas out of them so I’m looking forward to the comments on this and what thoughts people have on them.

Anyway, Picard has got me in a very Trek-y mood lately so I’ve been watching all the movies, most are re-watches but a couple for the first time. Naturally I ended up at what I’ll call the Kelvin films. I was born in 98 so these are the only Trek movies I was able to watch at the cinema, but I’m a big Trek fan and have been for as long as I can remember. 

I’m just going to say now I really like Star Trek 09 and Star Trek Beyond. Trek 09 was a really clever way to re-tell the story of the original crew of the Enterprise and the way it doesn’t obliterate the entire cannon by just starting again was a good choice on its part. (I know it does start most things over again but it’s an alternate realty so you get my point) And as for Beyond, I think I can honestly say it’s tied with First Contact for my favourite Trek movie. You can feel the love Simon Pegg has for it in his script and it just feels the most like Star Trek out of the new batch. It’s one of what I call my ‘happy films’. I just bloody love it. 

But man, Into Darkness...exists, I guess.

The 09 movie went so far out of its way to separate itself from Trek stories that had already been told just for them to come back to Khan. I guess at the very least we have something to point to as the moment JJ Abrams started remaking old movies instead of thinking up new ideas, because he did exactly the same with the Star Wars sequels. I know Khan is probably Trek’s most well known villain, but he’s by far the weakest part of this film. 

I’ll give the movie this, the morally grey stuff between Kirk, Marcus and Khan is good. I really enjoy a bit of throwing morally grey stuff into things, it just makes them a lot more interesting. But the rest of the film is average at best and it’s the only one of the new batch that I tend to agree with people who have more negative views of them. It’s such a lazy retelling and all of the tension between Khan and Kirk is lost because they don’t have that shared history they did in the original version. In this Kirk is more of a minor inconvenience to Khan than his sworn enemy, and that really takes away from the film.

Also I’d like to know how someone who was around before the timeline diverged went from hispanic to the most English guy to ever exist. I know Benedict Cumberbatch was, and still is, a huge name, but if prime timeline Klingon ships are shown in the Kobyashi Maru test in Trek 09 surely Khan can keep his race/ethnicity in this?

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the Kelvin films, nothing new but I have Reddit now some at least I can write them down. I know they’re not everyone’s cup of Earl Grey tea, but for the 2/3 majority I for one really enjoy them, especially Beyond. But yeah...Into Darkness...really not the best",Just some thoughts on the Kelvin movies

Geordi was so excited about hitting warp 9. What a letdown. Is that the fastest a ship can go? 

I feel like data could have figured that finger trip out. Seemed weird to me but they kept running with that gag. 

All right Worf is getting involved! I know he’s a Klingon and is a warrior but that’s about it. Loved to see him stand up for Riker. Hopefully he can have some bigger roles in upcoming episodes. 

The Enterprise crew has been coming across as so weak. Bowing to the orders or two different leaders in a row. Then Riker, Geordi, and Data all get smoked once they land on the planet. They sort of addressed it at the end when discussing with the empire leader about their philosophy. 

The Ferengi were 200 years behind us in culture but their weapons are stronger than ours? Also more sexist aliens when it comes to Yar. Again already?

startrek,"So after binging through TNG, VOY and DS9 for the very first time and I just finished ""What You Leave Behind"". I know stuff like this get's posted **a lot** and no one really cares about my opinion, but I wanted to share my thoughts anyway.

Firstly I think I have to say I'm not a big Star Trek nerd. I watched the old (Kirk) movies as a kid and really liked them but that's about it. I've seen the 2009 film and thought it was okay, same with Into Darkness (haven't seen Beyond yet), but I didn't really had any interest in watching the ST series, until I started watching Discovery when the second season came out in germany (and I'm sorry but I love it). When the first trailer for Picard came out I finally deccided to give TNG on Netflix a try but it took me about half a year or so to get through the first two seasons before I started binging the rest of TNG (including movies), VOY and then DS9.
I think every series had many highs and sadly also many lows (weird sex with a ghost comes to mind) and a lot of stuff that was kinda cool but nothing special either, but in the end I really liked all three of them. I want to make clear, this is not a *hate* post and I truly enjoyed watching DS9 for the most part (in some episodes it's better then anything TNG and VOY ever put out).

But let's get to the point... I know this is a very unpoular opinion but I did not enjoy ""What You Leave Behind"" almost at all. I heard a lot about this being the best final episode of all the series, but I must admit I don't feel the same.

Firstly I hated how the dominion war just ended like that with part one and the second part just focused on the prophet and the Pah-wraith stuff... And with that I also have to admit I was not a fan of this stuff from the very beginning and I didn't really enjoy most of the episodes centering around this religious stuff (like when the prophets just made the Dominion reinforcments disappear like the biggest dues ex machina). I sometime felt like watching Supernatural in space with the prophets beeing the angels and the pah-wraiths beeing the demons (even till the point of them possessing people and the red eys). And what about Sisko? Is he dead? Is he a prophet now who lives in the wormhole? I thought that was not just a little bit weird. Imo this all felt very fantasy and not very sci-fi at all (even tho I **LOVE** fantasy even more then sci-fi). I don't mind a little weirdnes in sci-fi and Star Trek always had this (Q is the fucking best) but I never thought that that kinda stuff should be one of the main themes of a series.

And then you have the epilog with these super cheesy flashbacks... This maybe worked better back when it aired, especially if you didn't just watched all seven seasons in about a month, but I kinda just rolled my eyes at this. The simple moment, when Picard joined the rest of the crew at poker, had me in tears, but this just didn't really click with me at all. (I know the reasoning behind it and can't put blame on anyone, but with Jadzia beeing left out of the memorys this all just felt kinda wrong, especially with Worfs flashbacks) 

Don't get me wrong, I would prefer the flashbacks over the strange sudden ending of Voyager any time, but I don't really get the praise this finally gets.

Now please tell me why I'm wrong, while I start watching Picard. I'm one of those people who absolutly loved Star Wars the Last Jedi and I also love DIS, think section 31 is nice concept and don't really like some of the utopian stuff about the Federation, so maybe I just have strange taste.

tl;dr: I did not like the DS9 finale",Finally finished DS9 [SPOILERS]

This might be a weird thing to take away from Trek, and an even weirder thing to talk about here, but with my recent watch through of all of the Trek series on netflix I've found a sense of acceptance in my identity.  
 I've identified as an Asexual (and ~~probably~~ Bi-romantic) for a bit, but watching Trek has just made me feel more comfortable with that part of myself myself.  
   
All of the characters are valuable to Starfleet without considering their sexuality, Data for instance is as close to a confirmed Ace as we get, and my personal favorite because of his relate-ability to me... even though I have to ignore the whole ""fully functioning"" thing in The Naked Now.    
Then there's Spock, who debatably also expresses some asexual leanings.   
lastly Jadzia being an example of a Pan-sexual, (Confirmed by Terry Farrell herself!) female presenting, gender fluid person makes me unbelievably happy! There are moments that it comes through, but I honestly see them as funny rather than anything which pulls me out of the show like they would in others. I think of the Ferengi Oo-Mox ritual as a good example, that's just hilarious to me whenever it happens because it kinda mirrors how alienated I feel from sex stuff.

One loose end I was wondering about was Kubus. The episode didn't resolve whether he was able to go to Bajor after all. Winn no longer had use for him after becoming Kai so maybe she withdrew her offer of sanctuary. On the other hand, Kira learning about what Opaka did - what she felt she *had* to do - could have given her a different view on collaborators like Kubus similar to how she changed her feelings in Duet.

A few episodes later, I watched “Relics” right before going to bed. Again, no idea what I was about to see. When Scotty showed up, I thought it would be a nice episode for nostalgia as I absolutely love TOS, watched it repeatedly as a kid, and only recently even gave TNG a chance (I’m so glad I did).

startrek,"The two most likely games would be either a strategy game like “Birth of the Federation” or for a more modern equivalent, “Stellaris” 

Or.....

A L.A noire type game, with you going around solving problems, and having an overarching plot in the background. 

However, a lot of the old games have fallen into obscurity. Conquest was interesting but it has some major lacking and came out around the end of the lifespan of the PS2 and the Wii. Legacy, while I think it’s good, could have been better and was disappointing for the 30th anniversary(in my opinion). You had Birth of the Federation, but it only had the Next Gen era, but otherwise was good, just kinda overshadowed by other games. We recently had Bridge crew, but that fell into obscurity, and I haven’t heard anything about it in a while. Stage 9 was shut down by cbs. And then we have STO. I would say, it’s a decent game. However, I don’t feel like it is the game should be the pinnacle of Star Trek games. It is a MMO rpg, mostly focused on action and any character choices are mute. Most of the game’s content is locked behind Zen, which is just a paywall. While you can access the story and have fun, it doesn’t feel rewarding after you get to level 40, and if you don’t want to pay money, you can grind for days to get dilithium that will then convert into a negligible amount of Zen. 
 
Star Trek needs something, it needs a hit game that lasts longer than bridge crew and is an actual story based game, unlike STO.",The Star Trek franchise is in need of a hit game
startrek,"So we know that Discovery is moving beyond anything we've seen before and that the Federation is a shadow of its former self. The flag seen in trailers has six stars, which could mean there are only six members left. This might not be the exact number, but it's probably close. What does everyone think about remaining members? My thoughts are :

Earth (obviously)
Trill - we've seen them in ads, they're very close in values to humans
Bajor - a federation officer was their religious icon

Probably not:
Andoria (seem to be villains in ads, were militarists in ENT era)
Tellarites
Vulcans (the proposed Star Trek: Federations which had a very similar premise had them having left to reunify with Romulans)

So I figure this is the best scenario to play around with Enterprise’s last episode. 

Should she watch it just as is?

Or watch the Pegasus episode in full before watching finale? Or after?

Were these just not made so they could cram in another 30 secs of ads or was this just not done for the DVDs so someone could piss me off.  


I know TOS ran for about 50 min a show plus a one minute preview.  TNG was around 45 min with a 30 sec preview.  It seems by the time of DS9 to ENT the shows were about 43 min an episode.

It then cuts to a close up of him and the Chancellor, saying 'People can be very frightened of change.' He and his bridge crew then get a standing ovation from all the dignitaries. Does anyone know what the speech was supposed to be? I've searched lightly, and can't find mention of it. I presume it got chopped for sake of run time.",Cut Shatner speech in Star Trek VI?
startrek,"DS9 had the best pilot of any Star Trek series except 'The Cage.'  It was intelligent, well written, had it's share of action and the acting was fantastic. If you need proof, you only need to look at how many times subsequent series took the 'alien as omnipotent being masking themselves as human' trope.  Voyager certainly did in it's pilot but not nearly as well.  TNG did it with Q but again, not as intelligently.  Q was a great character but he was a foil for Picard played mostly for comedy relief.

'The Cage' gets best episode because it's intelligence was so far ahead of it's time.  It's aliens didn't mask themselves as human, but manipulated humans with their artifice.  Showing this kind of writing (which I consider Sci-Fi at it's best) rather than simply shoot 'em up plots (Broken Bow comes to mind) puts it firmly at top of the list.

It is the most obvious and immediate implication of the creation of synthetic life. No one ""realized"" this. They already knew it. It's absolutely impossible to suggest otherwise.

startrek,The situation on AR 558 annoys me.  The defiant is sent to resupply their people there.  Who apparently are on the brink of insanity because of the war.  But what really bothers me is how poorly defended their settlement was.  Their technology is superior in a lot of ways compared to the dominion.  Why didn't they set up holo emitters to create holographic soldiers to defend the area.  The dominion is smart enough to use holograms.  When the jem'hadar showed up why did they not set their phasers to wide beam.  Why didn't they use drones and artificial satellites in orbit to observe the jem'hadar.  Instead of sending people on a suicide mission.  So AR-558 is just another example of starfleet getting people killed because of incompetence.  They had the resources and the technology to hold back the jem'hadar and keep casualties to a minimum.  But they didn't use them.  I find this very annoying.  What do you think.,Incompetence at AR-558
startrek,"S1E3 - Code of Honor

Overall, I thought this was a pretty weak episode. Lutan was so obviously a bad guy and the Star Fleet crew just came across as weak the whole time. My commentary below. 

So their first mistake was letting Yar go to the matrix room alone. Like yeah they all agreed she could go but I don’t remember them saying it had to be only her. And oh look, she got taken. Surprise. 

Weird that Wesley got a spot on the deck. Riker called it temporary, but we’ll see. Wanted him to earn it longer. 

Wow this fight to the death is straight out of Black Panther. I’m assuming the comics are older? Not sure. 

Oh and the fight is professional tag to the death. Gotta be some inspiration there. Lol

I was really intrigued by Picard’s rant about what happened to Earth! But then he cut it off in a nod to old fans saying “everyone knows that story”. Will I learn this story from the show or should I look up other source material??

Also Geordi trying to run out of the room because he’s heard 661 of Data’s jokes and can’t take another was fantastic. 😂",Star Trek TNG S1E3 Discussion
startrek,"Bit of a rant here (who am I kidding - it's a lot of a rant), but I just finished the show and, while it was entertaining, I would even call it good - I have to say - it just doesn't feel like Star Trek. At all. And I don't mean the constant action and brawls every episode - though of course, those contribute - but it's like Picard just forgot what Star Trek was about.

From the get go, we have a Federation that just... sucks. The Federation has been victim to sabotage by the Romulans, sure - but nonetheless, it's a broken, racist Federation, nothing like the one we know. Picard is a bitter old man living a quiet life in a shell of the Federation he once knew.

And sure, we had Deep Space 9, often considered the best Trek, making the Federation 'dark', and exposing corruption within the system, but no matter how dark DS9 got, it had a shining, very moralized crew to show the audience that there was still hope for good, no matter how broken the system was. Picard... doesn't have that. Picard has a bunch of bitter, broken people struggling within a demoralized Federation.

And besides that, Star Trek was always a very transhumanist show - from that episode back in TOS about transcended beings, to Wesley's ascension in TNG (yes, I know, we all hated it), Star Trek was always about going boldly forward - even Q was afraid of what humanity might become in the future, and that's saying something.

So the ending of Picard especially just felt... disappointing. Why does Data need to die to truly experience life? Why is Picard going to squander the opportunity of a \*new body\* on living out as a dying old man? Instead of the transhumanism that Star Trek has \*always\* purveyed, we've been given a fairy tale moral about how life wouldn't be valuable with death. It feels hollow and nonsensical. If you want to die, then die - but there's really no reason to live out your last few days in an increasingly decrepit body for that sake.

On top of that, the synthetic life versus organic life motif seemed a little bit... uninspired. First of all, is anyone getting Mass Effect vibes? And second of all, in an, again, transhumanist show, the implication that synthetic life is completely different and superior to organic life, and that there's no way for the two to work together (or, god forbid, exist as one) seems to lack vision to me. We've seen the 'AI will evolve and destroy all life' plot a hundred times before and it's not quite as compelling in a show about going forward - Picard himself says that fear is no way to live.",[Picard Spoilers] Does anyone else feel like Picard just... forgot to be Star Trek?
startrek,I've been binge watching enterprise.  They really were unprepared for the dangers of deep space.  They launched without all of their defenses.  They don't have a tractor beam or shields.  If it doesn't have shields they could at least use ablative armor but they didn't even do that.  And I'm not sure about the reliability of their transporter.  Especially since it caused hallucinations in one episode.  This is not the kind of ship a sane person would want to take into deep space.  Let alone go looking for hostile aliens.  This is the starship equivalent of those old world war two fighters that were made out of wood.  You would almost have to have a death wish to want to serve on this ship.  So they obviously had no idea what was out there.  If it wasn't for plot armor this ship would probably have been in tiny pieces long before the end of the first season.  Oh and it's really slow.  Twenty fourth century ships are almost twenty times faster.  So it would have taken them months to travel more then a few dozen light years.  Which means that outrunning hostile aliens wouldn't be an option.  Especially since many of them had ships capable of warp seven.  So the NX class is a death trap.  Anyone serving on one might want to put their affairs in order before hand.  It's probably the most rickety ship in star trek.  So let me know what you think.,Enterprise was unprepared for deep space

startrek,"I don’t know how many people have paid attention or who are common on the subreddit so who would know I make semi constant posts every so often the last few months and that I’m pretty brand new to the universe. I don’t want to keep pointing that out but I know it’s necessary to give context for what I’m feeling and trying to say or get others feelings on. I’ve only completed TNG and maybe midway through season 2 of DS9 in the main timeline series.

Now with that context out of the way I’ve watched both Picard and Discovery on CBS and honestly I haven’t had much problems with them. Starfleet is sad and depressed in Picard but that made more or less sense in the context of the show and I didn’t mind. The characters in it are also still really well done. So I’m more positive on Picard as additional context. Then I just finished up Discovery and I honestly don’t see any problems with it. It’s going back to true space exploration and space stuff that I’m not getting in DS9 and Picard took awhile to get to and even then wasn’t interesting, in space. 

One of my former coworkers is a Trek fan and hates Discovery because of the politics of the show and that it’s not true Star Trek. With previous context I can’t say one way or another if it is or isn’t but I never got the feeling it was dishonest. I haven’t yet seen a Starfleet during real wartime so the section 31 stuff made sense, even though I do agree that maybe they went too far or shouldn’t have had as much power after the war. And the season 2 baddie being an AI that all of Starfleet uses for strategic analyses is literally the worst idea ever. 

The Discovery itself is such a badass looking ship with a really intriguing special thing about it, the spore drive. It looks so sleek and dare I say sexy AF. Enterprise D ain’t got nothing on it. E is close though. Sorry TOS Enterprise but a little to simple for me lol. The spore drive in and of itself is something so brand new and amazing that I can see why Starfleet would want to look into it. Being able to just drop in and out of anywhere whenever is such a huge strategic advantage it makes sense. And that scene where it’s just jumping all over the damn place around a Klingon ship, I think the ship of the dead(?), was so outstanding and something I had wanted to see I loved it so much. 

Just saw the season 3 trailer and honestly it didn’t grab me at all. But I just want to know what the general opinion is of Discovery, not Picard that was just for added context, and why it seems to be mostly negative. I will say I’m more excited to get back into TOS, barely in season 1 so hardly worth mentioning, because the sound and ship designs, while obviously futuristic, still sounded the same and from the times we saw the Enterprise could see the similarities between this generation and back in the 60s. 

Total side note not at all connected to the main points of this but my god is DS9 honestly really boring and slow. Again only season 2 so I know it gets better later but god is it taking forever I just want to skip ahead but I can’t because that’s not appropriate and I’m a completionist.",Just general feelings on Discovery from anyone else
startrek,"This is something that always bugs me. Isn't there any culture on the Star Trek universe that is against beaming technology? I know that I wouldn't want to be beamed up anywhere, because the way I see it, teleport is just a fancy way of saying that someone was killed and a copy of them was made in another place.

I'm fine with many cultures accepting being beamed all the time, but even IRL I don't think there's any technology that everyone agrees it is ok. Some people are against blood transfusion, some people were against having their picture taken. And I imagine the First Directive would forbid the Starfleet beaming someone who opposed it on a cultural level.

So, did this subject ever came up on any Star Trek episode? I still haven't watched everything, so I wouldn't know.",Are there any culture against beaming technology?
startrek,"When I first watched the original series, I did so because I wanted view the franchise from the very beginning and while I enjoyed it immensely (It still has my all time favourite episode), I was always waiting to get to TNG.

It being the sixties I could understand why the characters never seemed to be that emotional and their attachment to each other always seemed so formal. (Except for Bones and Spock, of course).
I figured it was because back then, “men didn’t show emotion” and while there is definitely hints of that, I found myself disappointed that TNG seemed to be even more militaristic then in TOS. Everything seemed so formal and even the friendships took a back seat to politics and formalities. 

Now I’m not saying I hated TNG, in fact I’m going to do a rewatch after TOS, but I was disappointed in the direction they took StarFleet and the Federation as a whole. In TOS StarFleet was obviously based on the military, but they allowed for rule breaking and were more concerned about the “spirit of good”, rather then the fine print. 
 
Anyway back to my original point, as I’m rewatching the Original Series I’m becoming more and more aware of the personalities of all the characters, and though it focuses on the big three, as opposed to the more ensemble crew, the characters all seem so personable and deep. I could literally write an entire post about each of them.
 Kirk the StarFleet man through and through, who has to juggle his responsibilities and his ethics to save the crew, and occasionally save the universe.
 Spock constantly struggling to reconcile is two halves and it’s only until he dies, (and gets into the mind of McCoy) he manages to become more balanced. 
 Speaking of McCoy, what a fantastic character! Choosing ethics over orders and shows his true colours as the confidante and guide to Kirk.

As I’m going through I’m seeing a new side to each character and though there are elements that are dated, and certainly wouldn’t fly today, the show makes an incredible character study of three completely different people, who work so well together. Spock the brain, McCoy the heart and Kirk the body. Each different yet working together.

startrek,"Most of the time at least in the TNG-VOY era the crew seemed somewhat informal with each other following only basic formalities as the situation called for it. Gene Roddenberry didn't even like to think of Starfleet as a military. 

They were especially informal much of the time on DS9. Yet when Cadet Nog started his training they were super formal with him. Everything was ""yes sir"" ""no sir"" snap to attention, be a rigid soldier. 

That sort of thing makes sense for a modern military where the priority is training men and women to be capable of going into dangerous situations and killing on command. You want to break them down into a rigidly obedient individual. 

But Starfleet's mission is primarily a peaceful one, they're interested in exploration, scientific discovery, charting new planets, that suggests something different than a soldier's mindset. I wouldn't think a soldier would make a terribly good scientist.

Now I'm not saying they shouldn't have combat training. Obviously its part of their function to be able to fight. But it doesn't make sense to give them the full traditional military conditioning.

If you're going to make a fanservice-y series, make it totally fanservice-y and cheesy!

If you want to watch Picard you need background information for the story. This is a very short list but I think it covers most of the series. Its important that you watch these episodes and the movie. If you dont watch them you wont understand everything. (Especially if you are new to Star Trek) 

The Next Generation:

- Measure of a man (About Data and Bruce Maddox) 
- Unification 1 &amp; 2 (About Romulus, not very important but it gives some context) 
- Face of the enemy (About the Tal'Shiar) 
- I, borg (About Hugh) 
- Best of Both Worlds 1 &amp; 2 (About Picards history with the Borg) 
- The Offspring (About Data) 

Movies:

- Star Trek Nemesis (Very important for the story around Data) 

Voyager episodes:

- Scorpion 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg and Seven of Nine) 
- The Raven (About Seven of Nine) 
- Dark Frontier 1 &amp; 2 (About the Borg) 
- Imperfection (Icheb) 

This is a very short list. There are probably more episodes which would help. But I think the episodes above are the most important to understand events prior to the Picard series.

I'm watching TNG for the first time on Amazon Prime and regularly pause the episodes to Google search random facts and tidbits of information discussed on the show.

He stated that it was a mathematical equation that had been unsolved for nearly 800 years, and one that he regularly tinkered with because he found it to be ""stimulating"".

Cue the Google searching. I quickly found the link to the Wikipedia article on the equation, and was astonished that the equation had actually been proven in 1995, roughly 6 years after the aformentioned episode originally aired in 1989.

startrek,"I'm about two thirds of the way through my rewatch of Deep Space Nine, and it strikes me how perfectly analogous the show is for today's culture of lockdowns and social distancing. Something that has struck me over the last month is, despite how rapidly our way of living has changed, we have all adjusted and adapted just as quickly to existing in the shadow of this new threat. 

Compare this to Deep Space Nine. Yes, the the threat of the Dominion perpetually hovers on the other side of the wormhole, but Quark still must carry on doing business, dealing with the usual Ferengi politics. Life on the station changes drastically, from Bajoran political upheaval, to hosting a permanent Klingon garrison, but Dax still continues the customs of her people by assessing a potential Trill host. While it can definitely be argued that this quality of the show is partly due to its episodic nature, the writers are not afraid to maintain the consequences of the changes and the upheaval of the status quo. Things don't just 'go back to normal'. Our characters must adapt and, importantly, continue with their daily lives, facing the Marquis or Jem'Hadar when they must, and coping with the fallout. 

On my daily walks it now feels perfectly natural to encounter face masks in, what always felt like, my safe corner of Britain. So do the empty shops and restaurants I pass.

startrek,"I had been waiting until I had a chunk of time before getting the CBS free trial so I could watch Picard.  I was off this week from work because of COVID-19 stuff, so I thought I should watch it.  I was honesty nervous and not excited to watch it.  I hadn't read too many posts about it because I was afraid of spoilers, but I had read enough negative things to make me not sure I wanted to watch it.

I bit the bullet and watched it last week.  It was honestly a little sad, Patrick Stuart is getting old ad it was almost hard to watch because of that.  I am a HUGE Star Trek fan Jean-Luc has always been my favorite captain.  It's hard to watch actors you love get older, it really is.  It was also the least ""Star Trek"", Star Trek series I've ever seen.  It had the same species, same Federation, same bad guys, and some of the same people but it was very different.  

The plot was confusing and jumped around, the dialog was stiff and hard to understand at times.  I didn't find the plot engaging enough to fully pay attention too, I found myself easily distracted and didn't care enough about the show to rewind.  

What I did like was the reunion of the familiar characters.  It was fun to see Picard catch up with old crew members.  It was nice to see the familiar species Borg, Romulans, and androids.  

The season was only 10 episodes long and it all came together rather conveniently.  I am disappointed because they could have done so much more!  They had the time, money, and resources to make a really wonderful show and the kind of blew it.  They were never going to do justice to TNG but they could have done more than what they did.  

If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's still Star Trek and it's still Jean-Luc.  If there is a season 2 I hope they do a better job.  I may go back and watch season 1 again in a few months, maybe now that I know the plot and where it's going I'll like it better.",Picard---Spoiler Free

Q, of course.  Who else would exist so far out of the timeline that prophecy doesn't apply to him?

He disrupted the whole series of events by bringing the Borg into it.  That led to Hugh, which led to Descent, where Lore was ultimately defeated by Data before he could fulfill his role in the prophecy.

startrek,"There was a post here about how Spock (and Vulcans in general) can be seen as autistic, or at least based upon an autistic person, that I can’t seem to find now.
Anyway, there I discussed how there was another race that to me, always seemed to be an analogy of autism, and I thought I’d make a full post about it here.
 To start I should say that I am on the spectrum myself so that this discussion will be more from that perspective than that of, say a psychologist. 

Anyway, it seems to me that the Liberated Borg are the most autistic people in the universe. I realise that they are not a species, rather a group of races freed from a terrible hive-mind but that rather helps my case I believe.

So to start, unlike the Vulcans whose society is dedicated to the concept of hiding ones emotions, the Liberated Borg are from many different cultures that view things completely differently. Similar to how someone on the spectrum can be born anywhere and to any culture. They don’t fit in with what their culture asks of them. 

•They have emotions but don’t know how to deal with them. 
•They struggle with many of the concepts of socialisation and have to be taught how to interact with people. 
 •They seem like outsiders to everyone else because they don’t know how to fit in.
•They don’t always know the right way to go about getting something they want and can come across as rude without meaning to.
•They find it difficult to make friends, not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t know how to, as such they tend to come together in solidarity.
•They like to be punctual and efficient and dislike when things go wrong, (like being late)
•They can become obsessed by things that make them forget about other aspects of their lives.
•They like things done their way, without considering how others might feel. 
•They struggle with sensory overload, but it’s inverted. Instead of being too loud (just an example) its being too quiet.
•They can have incredible knowledge in one field they find interesting, while not knowing a thing about something seemingly obvious.
•Most importantly of all though. They are all unique and these features don’t define them. They struggle but they learn. What might seem like a disadvantage, can lead to advantages elsewhere. They all have their talents, and eventually form very close bonds built with understanding and loyalty. 

Obviously these traits are down to the story and their past traumas, but like most species in Trek, they represent an aspect of humanity. I believe it to be autism.",Autism in Star Trek

startrek,"Hello,

I’m just wondering if anyone can tell me about a model that was released. I’ve looked online and can’t find any information.

When I was a kid, I used to go to a sci-fi/comic shop, where they had a very large model of the Enterprise-D, this was when the show was still on the air, or maybe it had just finished a year or two prior.

I’d estimate it was 4ft, maybe 6ft but probably not. It certaintly took up an entire display window. What I mean is, it may have been moulded from the original filming models.

I saw the same model years later (around 2015) in a forbidden planet in Bristol, so it wasn’t custom made. However the staff had no idea about the history.

I’d just love to know more about it.",Large Enterprise Model?
startrek,"It seems to me that in every thread about Picard, comments originate from one of two camps: people who really appreciate the ride the show is taking us on, and people who have trouble enjoying the show because of its inconsistencies with both itself and with Star Trek past. And much like America's two political parties at the moment, debates between the two seem to be filled with resentment of one another. My solution to bridging this gap within this subreddit? Everyone should listen/watch BOTH the Greatest Discovery podcast and the re:Views posted on YouTube by RedLetterMedia.


If you're of the type wondering whether other fans must be watching with their brains turned off because of the show's seeming ignorance of canon or history (or sometimes logic), I think what you'd gain from listening to Adam and Ben is an understanding of how two people who have just as much fondness for Star Trek could enjoy Picard. I think you'd see that Adam and Ben are bright guys who are as big a Star Trek nerds as anyone else, they clearly do not watch with their brains turned off, and just engage with the show differently. Plus they're really funny.


If you're of the type wondering why other fans seem so nitpicky and frustrated with the show, I think what'd you gain from watching Mike and Rich is seeing how: 1) the issues they have with the show are very reasonable and often undeniable and 2) their criticism is borne out of a desire for high quality and a concern for how much care is given to a franchise they have deep affection for. They're far from sticks in the mud who sit around pining for old Trek and who hate anything new.


The two shows obviously aren't in dialogue and they won't reconcile the issues or viewpoints that the other one brings up, but I think digesting both of them helps produce a balanced view of the show and of modern Trek. Listening/watching them humanizes different perspectives and I think will lead to richer, more nuanced discussions among fans. I think you'll find them both worthwhile if you haven't already checked them out.",Greatest Discovery vs. Red Letter Media on ST: Picard
startrek,"I just finished Unification in my TNG watch through and at the end of Part 2 Data beems down to Romulus as his normal android self. He then talked to the common people supporting reunification, the senitor who is Spock's friend. In the same scene Several Romulan guards and Sela surround Data and Picard and Sela sais something along the lines of ""So this is the android I've grown to respect in combat"", addressing Data as an android in front of everybody. There is then few lines exchanged fairly calmly and they are taken prisoner. Durring that time only Spock and Picard are questioned and Data is unnecessary to the Romulans. 

Given what we now know about the Zhat Vash, and more importantly the general Romulan fear of synthetics, this seems rather strange. I get that a this point Data is one of 2 sentient androids and nobody knows how to make more, so he isn't an immanent threat. And might end up being useful as a Starfleet Officer so they don't kill him immediately. But it doesn't seem possible he could stand in front of Romulans from all walks of life as an android and nobody really seems to care. There isn't any unease or tension of any kind between the people in that scene. In the last episode of Picard Narak tells the Romulan myth of the original twins and he seems to expect the random Federation citizens he's talking to be at least a little familiar with it, which suggests every Romulan knows the story.

Obviously this is a ""The Zhat Vash and synth fear didn't exsist in the 80's so they writers didn't know"" situation. But does anybody have an in-universe explanation for why all the Romulans are chill with the destroyer of worlds secretly hanging out on Romulus?",Unification and the Zhat Vash

In fact, I read somewhere that in many aspects the Kelvin timeline was closer to 25th century technology in the main universe.

It is visibly larger than the Enterprise-D, possibly even E, and quite a bit more advanced than Kirk's main timeline ship.

The main thread should have been the Borg Reclamation Project. There could have been diplomatic controversies surrounding it, allowing some old school Picard diplomat content.

There could have still been the Zhat Vash, but they could have been targeting the Project for the same reasons they had about the synthetics.

With those two concepts being the thrust of the show, that would allow so much more time to cover the relationships of the characters.

I was bummed again when I saw that the Enterprise B was an Excelsior Class ship (another design I feel unnecessarily elongated and flattened the classic design) and then lost interest in Starfleet ship design entirely when the Sovereign Class made its appearance. 

I don't understand the desire to keep flattening and elongating the classic design.

I've always been under the impression since TNG that Data and Geordi were best friends. Geordi always seemed to be the main go to guy for Data, encouraging him to explore dreams and emotions and Data even said to Lore that Geordi was his friend and that he would hurt Geordi for emotions when he was under Lore's influence. 

That's not to say that Picard didn't have a real profound influence on Data's development towards understanding humanity but they didn't seem to go and casually 'hang out' like Data and Geordi did on a normal friends basis - like Geordi and Data talk about their holodeck adventures.

startrek,"What shows or movies do you think feel like Star Trek but are not part of Star Trek at all? TBH I'm looking for good things to watch. 

I'll give the two that come to mind (feel free to take these as recommendations)

1. Interstellar: I know, I know, many people hate the ending, I love it but what ya gonna do. But conceptually this feels like Star Trek in a pre-Enterprise sort of way. You have an Earth that's dying from climate change as people are embracing anti-intellectualism and anti-science because they have simply lost hope in humanity's resilience. There's no immediate reason to hope so they just don't.   All changes when a group of human explorers goes into the unknown with a slim hope of saving humanity and expanding to the Stars. It's ultimately a story about how human ingenuity can accomplish anything. That's a very Star Trek message. 
2. Defiance: I recently rewatched this series, I was so pissed off when Syfy canceled it that I haven't given a Syfy show a chance ever since. This series is about a town where different alien species live in peace with each other, or they try at least. The backdrop of the series is a very vicious war between humanity and the aliens that left many cultural wounds between them. It ended when both sides in a battle defied orders, dropped their weapons,  work together to save the human and alien civilians that were caught in the crossfire.  It's very DS9 but set on Earth. The main character is the human sheriff, his alien adoptive daughter. (It also has beautiful cinematography for a Syfy TV show) 
3. BONUS: This is a completely different genre and medium, but if you haven't check out the Sherlock Holmes stories. 8/9 books are on the public domain so you can read them online, they're also short reads, like 100 pages each. There's a reason why there's such a crossover between Sherlock Holmes fans and Star Trek fans, they have similar themes and values but in completely different contexts.

startrek,"Spoilers ahead for Picard!

I just binged watched the season and wanted to write down some of my thoughts. I'm new to the Star Trek universe (except the JJ movies), and this was my first Star Trek show. 

And I will say I'm kinda in love with Star Trek now. The show was intriguing and exciting and was a fun ride. The whole universe was so cool (I really want a replicator please) and the overall story kept me on the edge of my seat. 

I really enjoyed all the characters, except for and I will probably get a lot of hate for this, Picard. He did have his moments for sure but I obviously have no prior knowledge or any nostalgic feelings for this guy, so I felt he was too much of a one dimensional, can only do good, character. He seems too black and white. Like he didn't have ANY misgivings about synth life that can literally destroy all organic life as we know it? Like he was a little too hyper optimistic. I know I definitely understood the viewpoint of the Tal Shiar given the vision/past they saw. 

But the moral greyness in a lot of the other characters, the sacrifice and motivations of some characters had to take especially in regards to taking a life to save another, is what really made this show great. Loved Narek (and his pain about loving Soji but needed to destroy her and her kind), Narissa (badass but anyone else get a little incest-y vibes from them early in the season tho?), Agnes (didn't care for her at first), 7 of 9 (also badass and gay. loved that she got revenge on that one chick on Free Cloud), Rios (love the multiple personality ship program thing, really cute) and pretty much the rest. 

However, I did think the ending was a little flat and unbelievable? I didn't have to suspend my disbelief THAT much prior to the finale. I know there was quite a bit of fan service in the show, and it kinda felt like the whole star fleet getting there in the nick of time by his old buddy was shoehorned in. Like this guy who hasn't been in Star Fleet for years just suddenly leads a giant fleet to stop an intergalactic event from happening? Not to mention they had banned synths and all of a sudden they're ok potentially starting a war with the Romulans just to save a handful of life they didn't deem worthy of existing in the first place? 

Plus the Romulans just backing out after they didn't activate the beacon was kinda too clean. The Tal Shiar's main objective their whole organization is dedicated to kill all synthetic life forms and they just back out? Would they not sacrifice themselves to see their main objective complete? And then synth ban is lifted and Picard comes back to life, which obviously they can't make a show with his name without him but it makes his sacrifice almost meaningless.

I think maybe if they hadn't rushed it so much and made the season a bit longer it might have felt more satisfying. However... saying all that, I do prefer a wrapped up season as opposed to cliff hangers. I'm glad the story was all concluded and I do love a happy feel good ending (that crew shot in the end tho!). Even tho the ending was pretty disappointing and a dip in the overall series I still loved the journey getting there and the season overall. And happy that this series exists, might make a trekkie outta me.

Now to us, it might be more obvious that this is a guy living out a fantasy (either a dream or holodeck). 

But to audiences at the time, what was Dwight Schultz known for? He'd just finished his run on the A-Team as Howling Mad Murdock. So that makes him more credible as this tough guy that can bully the Enterprise crew. That makes it more believable that the writers might have actually cast him as this reckless violent officer.

Although, I must point out that they are not flowers, just flowers, and they are rather hard to get rid of. When I write, I like to put in references to Shakespeare. I like to look at some of the classic plays, and try to relate them to my story.

startrek,"Thought/theory is for the Kelvin timeline and why the Enterprise seems huge compared to TOS and main timeline Constitution class ships. Could it be that since a future Romulan “mining” vessel attacked the Kelvin that Starfleet thought about it and were like “hmm. We need a bigger badder flagship than the one we have planned” and in so doing skipped the Constitution class and went straight into Constellation(?) or whichever is the next iteration or the one after that with size and power? 
Idk if it would be Galaxy class but probably by the time the Enterprise D comes to pass in the Kelvin timeline that would be further advanced as well. 
Pure speculation of course, and I think the real world explanation is it needed room for added shuttles and shuttle bays but I like thinking in world better. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of Picard. Now I’m pretty new to the universe of Trek, only finished TNG and in the second season of DS9, so I don’t have nearly the experience or knowledge to really say how it was as a Trek show and I get that. Having said that I’m kinda in the middle. 
On the one hand I loved Picard the character and his utter no nonsense on how Starfleet has disappointed him deeply. I’m on the fence about the world as it is since TNG explicitly stated, and I’m sure DS9 or Voyager also hinted at, that Earth is no longer about monetary gain or individual power and only wants to expand our knowledge and understanding of the universe or just do nothing. But they did I think a fair job in showing that maybe since the attack on Mars and Starfleet backing off that’s why things have gone back to our normal. 
On the other hand I also hate how characters we know and love aren’t around, for long at least, and the ones we do get are either boring or don’t get enough to do. Also starting to get annoyed with prophecies or warnings or in this case both at the same time. 
I do wish that for Picard they had made it more of the exploration of space with a subplot of the Romulan ploy or something like that and especially with the slow opening of the first few episodes that would have been better. 

Now for the season finale and Godamn idk how to feel about it. Gonna be honest I kinda wanted the Romulans and Starfleet to get into a massive battle as that could have been awesome but that’s not Star Trek and I get it. What Picard did was 100% the only way to go about it. 
His mind being transferred was absolutely predicted and foreshadowed and even though I knew they were going there I was hoping they wouldn’t and I would get pissed if they did it. So hoping they would just let him die after saving an entire race of androids and preventing a massive war. I know the show is called Picard but still they could have continued the show in his memory if they wanted. 
I still lost it when he died though. I don’t care if we all knew he was going to live so it shouldn’t matter or whatever but we still literally watched him die. The Picard we knew is dead. This Picard, while maintaining his DNA and memories, isn’t the Picard that died. He even had to make sure they didn’t make him immortal so that alone still confirms it isn’t our Picard. Having said that he’s also gonna be the Picard we still look up to and believe in. 
I’m intrigued to see where season 2 goes, hopefully the return of other beloved characters and some real space exploration stuff, and I’ll see if I care to resubscribe at that point",A random thought/potential theory and feelings on Picard *SPOILERS* sorta
startrek,"Out of all of the ST shows, Voyager is perhaps the one with the most potential, that was the least developed.

It goes beyond just photontorpedoes and shuttlecraft. After each episode, everything is back to normal and the crew goes back to being just regular Starfleet folks doing their thing.

There’s no sense of these people actually believing or acting like they’re going to be stuck in the Delta Quadrant for decades.


So how would you change the show and makes it live up to its premise?

Here are some of my ideas:

* Janeway starts turning the Voyager into a generational ship. They start growing their own food, plants start lining the corridors to take some of the pressure of the oxygen system.

* As the season begins, we see Starfleet members wearing their usual uniforms, while the Maquis crewmembers wear their clothes, just with combadges. As the season progresses, we see the two styles mix more. Starfleet uniforms appearing more out of regulation and Maquis members wearing parts of Starfleet uniforms.

* Janeway and the senior officers also come to the realization that in worst case scenario they need to start having children. Naturally encouraging people will only go so far, so what to do? Should the computer just pair people up? Artificial insemination? What about people who for some reason don’t want children?

* They decide to introduce holodeck and replicator ration priority to people who sign up for having children, which naturally leads to some grumbling. Will this ultimately lead to Voyager becoming a ship with a privileged class and an underclass? What about polygamous marriages? They’re against Starfleet regulations, but some crewmembers want to try that arrangement. Janeway decides to allow it and go against Starfleet regulations. One of many violations of official regulations to come.

* Janeway uses some Starfleet emergency regulation to declare existing marriages null and void. Janeway and the senior officers decide that they must lead by example, so she expects each of her senior officers to pair up with another. Much to her anguish she also chooses to set a good example, but with who? She knows Tuvac better, but marrying Chakotay might lessen the Maquis-Starfleet tensions that have been brewing.

* The Voyager gets an opportunity to take some years off their journey, but it means they must violate Starfleet directives. Janeway does this, and starts to realize that she might have to break more in the future to ensure the ships safety. Ultimately she decides not to commit an even more egregious violation of their principles. Which leads to...

* Janeways trial. The crew put Janeway on trial. For breaking Starfleet protocol? Or is it because she didn’t do enough to bring them home? The Voyager is in full mutiny, the senior officers are divided. Should they use force? Ultimately Janeway notices something encouraging. The fracture lines aren’t between Maquis and Starfleet crewmembers. Instead some of the Maquis join Starfleet crewmen in wanting to restore order, while some Starfleet crewmen have joined in with former Maquis and demand that they no longer strictly adhere to Starfleet protocol. As a result...

* The Voyager holds elections for the post of Captain and First officer. Janeway, much to her chagrin realizes that the ship that some day will return to the Alpha quadrant may not be a Starfleet vessel but something very different.

Aaaand, that would be my short treatment for the first season or two of Voyager.

What do you think? How would you make the show live up to its full potential?",How would you make Voyager more interesting?
startrek,"Let's be honest. We say TOS, but the title of the show is not ""Star Trek: the original series"", it is just ""Star Trek"" . Every series afterwards has been ""Star Trek: (insert series name)""  but the first show is still just ""Star Trek"".  So here is how we should properly refer to every show. 

Instead of TOS, we should say Star Trek, or ""ST"" 

TAS, or ST:TAS is still appropriate for the animated series. 

TNG or ST:TNG is still appropriate for the next generation.

DS9, or ST:DS9 is still appropriate for deep space nine

VOY, or ST:V or ST:VOY are still appropriate for voyager

ENT, or ST:E, or ST:ENT are still appropriate for enterprise

DIS, or ST:D or ST:DIS is still appropriate for discovery

startrek,"The Star Trek franchise has always had some references to martial arts since the original, but most fighting was still old-fashioned stage combat or Western cowboy stuff. I think Discovery and Picard have way too much martial arts and it seems silly. I understand it's the trend in Hollywood since The Matrix and other movies started showcasing Hong Kong-style elaborate fight choreography. I'm a martial arts fan but I think there's too much of that genre crossing into the sci-fi of Trek, which is supposedly based on the possibilities of real science and astrophysics. Elaborate kung fu fighting is a fantasy. Burnham and Georgiou have been at it since the beginning of Discovery, and now in Picard we see Jason Bourne androids, a Romulan anime samurai, and Romulan spies doing spinning jump kicks. Does anyone else wish for the good ol' two-handed karate chop against a slow-moving Gorn? Or just a single punch and someone quips, ""Cowboy diplomacy?""

After searching Google, I learned that Sutra was made by Soong and Maddox, and she used to have a twin (Jana), who was killed by Captain Vandermeer before he killed himself, which traumatized Rios and turned him into an alcoholic.

What I haven’t been able to figure out is why Dahj and Soji had dormant combat programming in their systems. When I was watching Picard, I felt like maybe Commodore Oh was using Dahj’s mom as a mask to manipulate her, but that doesn’t make sense, since Dahj killed a bunch of Romulans.

I used to catch TOS reruns on TV when I was a kid, but the military-style 60s kitsch and long dramatic pauses are not my thing. But there has to be something good here, right? I mean, Spock? Action? Casual sexism? 

I'm 11 episodes into Season 1. The first few episodes feel both too slow and underdeveloped, plot-wise - long on long stares and short on background.

Were they trying to make him skip that rank? Maybe, at TNG time, commodores were called ""rear admiral"" and they spoke just ""admiral"" to shorten. 

Anyway, as someone who only watched the series and movies and didn't read any of the novels, I have my doubts if Jean Luc, Kirk and Janeway were ever commodores/rear admirals or they just skipped straight to full admiral because they're so awesome.",Was Picard ever a commodore?
startrek," Oh, shit. I just figured out how Picard should have actually   
 ended. 

(spoilers)

 I'd keep almost everything the same - the crew on the planet convince  the androids to close the portal (stupid though the mystery box was)  Riker shows up and convinces the Romulans to leave (lame though the deus  ex machina was), and then Picard's aneurism triggers and he collapses  to the floor. 

The crew beam down to the planet and begin trying  to upload Picard's consciousness to the android-body. Picard's ""soul""  goes to the databank and speaks to Data's ghost and they say their  tearful farewells, Picard agrees to pull the plug and let Data die. 

 Meanwhile, in the real world, disaster - Dr Soong has selfishly  sabotaged the process, transmitting his own consciousness to the  android. ""Picard died a natural death,"" he argues, ""There's no reason he  should get what was meant to be mine!""

7 of 9 shows up and saves  the day; she injects Picard with Borg nanites that can regulate his  neural activity and keep him alive; the crew re-download his  consciousness back to his original body, and everybody is happy (though  obviously Dr Soong is now a pariah). Picard makes it clear he's happier  in his own skin, even if he has a small bit of borg tech back in the  mix, so everyone's relieved. 

They hold a small memorial for Data and pull the plug, just like in the original show. 

 The crew beams up to the ship and warps away, feeling like big damn  heroes. The credits roll. Then we get an after-credits scene...

 Picard wanders the halls of the ship. There's something... different,  something cold about his posture, about his face. He finds 7 of 9,  alone. She smiles. Her eyes flash green-and-back. When she speaks, it is  with the thousand voices of a Collective...

OMG! This show is soo fucking stupid. Such a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay for it. 

Let me start off by saying that I appreciate a lot with you Millenials. You are great with I.T., you have a wonderful sense of confidence, but your storytelling... is... just stupid. And that is what Picard seems to me to be, a Millenial version of Star Trek. You got the cliche badasses with vape pens, tattoos, the computer voice that sounds just like Siri, the impossibly badass fight scenes, the Lord of the Rings reject character, the convoluted storyline (because if it's complicated it makes it good right), the Game Of Thrones gore, that ""quirky"" sense of humor, the drinking whiskey out of the bottle, The F-bombs, and on and on.

Looking at Netflix or really any other streaming services, very few of the new shows are Sci-Fi.  And the ones that are (Lost in Space season 2) are kind of lackluster and predictable.   

So what gem have I missed?  Doesn't have to be in English as long as there are subtitles.","After Picard, what other Sci-Fi do you folks watch?"
startrek,"I've seen bits and pieces of Star Trek over the years, but I'd never been a huge Trekkie or anything like that. However, I eventually realized that a good deal of the sci-fi I've read/watched over the years is..kind of bleak and depressing. I love Blade Runner as much as the next person, but you can only read/watch so many cyberpunk/post apocalyptic stories about humanity failing to make any sort of progress in the future without getting kinda depressed. I realized I was craving some optimistic, humanistic sci fi where the future isn't a total shithole, so last December I decided to start watching Star Trek from the beginning. 

On the whole, I liked TOS a lot, especially the first two seasons. Despite the dated special effects and the surprising amount of casual sexism, a lot of it held up really well! My top ten episodes: 

1. **Balance of Terror** - A genuinely thrilling story. The fear and uncertainty surrounding the Romulans' sudden attacks on the Federation's outposts, the mutual respect between Kirk and the Romulan commander, it was all so well done. 

2. **The Enterprise Incident** - One of the few truly great episodes in season 3. I love the Cold War-style conflict between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire, and the budding forbidden romance between Spock and the Romulan commander makes me think of this episode as basically a Spock-centered Balance of Terror. 

3. **Journey to Babel** - The episode that really made me love Spock as a character. 

4. **The Doomsday Machine** - Like Balance of Terror, an episode that's aged very well. 

5. **The Immunity Syndrome** -The Enterprise vs. a giant space amoeba, some self-sacrifice from Spock, and Kirk refusing to allow it. What's not to love? 

6. **The Changeling** - Classic ""talking a computer to death"" stuff. 

7. **Obsession** - An underrated episode with some great character moments for Kirk and Bones. 

8. **The Trouble With Tribbles** - The scene where Kirk is chewing out his crewmen for getting into a bar fight with the Klingons never fails to crack me up. 

9. **The Devil in the Dark** - Another underrated episode. 

10 **The Ultimate Computer** - Fascinating episode about the dangers of AI. 

If you're wondering why I don't have **The City on the Edge of Forever** or **Mirror, Mirror** on my top ten list like everyone else does, it's because I think that those two, while good, are both a little overrated and don't deserve to be counted among the absolute best episodes. 

Now that the positive stuff has been said, I'll give some criticisms. Season 3 was a struggle to get through. The only episodes from this season that I really loved and can see myself rewatching we're The Enterprise Incident, The Tholian Web, and Day of the Dove. The rest of it ranges from mediocre to straight-up-awful (Spock's Brain, Turnabout Intruder). 

I'm also surprised at how underdeveloped Sulu and Uhura are as characters. After three seasons, I couldn't tell you a thing about their personalities, despite them being regulars. That said, I love Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty, and the post-episode banter between the three main characters was some of my favorite parts of the show. 

Anyway, this weekend I'm gonna watch the TOS films from The Motion Picture all the way to The Undiscovered Country, then I'm gonna start on The Next Generation!",Yesterday I finished watching The Original Series for the first time...
startrek,"Greetings everyone on this fine quarentined day. Over the past couple weeks I have recently found myself exposed to the new trek as well as the criticisms behind them and wanted to share my experiences as well as hear from others on theirs.

To point out though, I am only 18 years old. I have been watching Star Trek since I was two and have watched every series and movie. I do not know everything about Star Trek but I do know I am a major fan. I had initially avoided the New Treks, such as Discovery and the movies, since many negative opinions were floated around online. However, I have finally watched them and come to love them.

To start off, the movies. I had no quarrel with them at all. It was an attempt at starting over. Letting a new universe be built. I loved the fact that a seperate timeline was created just for that. I found it ingenious. However, I have never been the biggest fan of TOS. This new take on the movies gave me a new interest in Captain Kirk as a character and his growth in this new timeline. However, I was more intrigued by the relationship between him and Spock. The strongest bond between a captain and first officer ever seen in Star Trek. (I know many will say Picard and Riker were strong as well, but I saw that more as a Mentor/Ward relationship than a relationship between equals). Overall, I enjoyed the idea of the movies more than the movies themselves. I honestly was wondering if we would ever get a Kelvin Picard.

Next, Picard. Now, when I heard Picard was coming out, I started giggling like a child. My favorite species has always been the Borg. They were the species that caught the most of my attention throughout all of Star Trek. So, when I heard Picard was being made, I knew the Borg would return. In the past, over psychoanalysis of trauma indured by Star Trek characters seemed a bit... brushed by? I think this was because the world of Star Trek was originally assumed to be a sort of Utopia besides the happenings in space. I have heard several comments about how Gene Roddenberry would have never let certain things happen like they have been with New Trek. For instance, The Seven/Picard heart to heart of their trauma as Borg. Anyways, I digress. I watched Picard as each episode came out. I was seeing a lot of hate for it though. Some was understandable I would admit, but I noticed, the less I tried to compare it to continuity, the more I would enjoy it. Picard was the perfect love letter to the character of Data. I loved every second of it. The ending was slightly predictable though, however, thats how it is when you want to make more than one season. Picards characterization seemed a bit scattered at first but seemed to piece itself together near the end. I loved seeing the aftermath of the Romulan Supernova and seeing what the federation has become. Its flaws being unveiled. A common theme in New Trek. I always have enjoyed politics in movies and understanding motives. I guess that is why I liked the Star Wars Prequel triology. I will admit though, it does not take the cake as my favorite Star Trek series.

Finally, Discovery. Oh boy. The awful comments I have heard of this show over the years. I never stepped near it until recently and I must admit, I was surprised and impressed. After watching Picard, I knew Discovery's biggest problem will be keeping to continuity. I knew if I watched it while keeping that in mind, I would find myself miserable. So, I watched it without it in mind and frankly, I loved it. The character depth in the 15 episode first episode made me feel so connected to the characters faster than even my favorite Star Trek: DS9. I loved the politics behind it all. The lore expansion of Sarek and consequently Spock. I loved the fact that the Mirror Universe became a maine plot point. I loved how despite Starfleets imperfections, its morals and values was the main driving force. The action sequences were incredible. The idea of the spore drive, although a bit out of the wrong time frame, is freaking cool. At the time of this post, I am on Season 2 Episode 2. I must say, I have fell in love with Captain Pike so quickly. The wisdom he holds is prominent. The actor who portrays him is excellent. I am so excited for the second season plus whenever the third comes out

startrek,"I just watched the Voyage Home because the Guardian did an article on it. 

I mean, the writing is a masterclass, no line is wasted, whether it’s an (earned) character moment, a set up to a later scene (or a payoff) or just a nice general piece of witty business.  

The performances, particularly the leads, are note perfect, underplayed, and warmly conveyed with just the right amount of tongue in cheek. Most of it actually plays more seriously than I actually remembered. There’s only one bit of *The Shat*, when he spots George and Gracie on the side of the bus. 

Other than that, it’s a perfect piece of storytelling, with the emphasis on story. 

All too often we see things that are either all plot and no character or all character and no plot. This was a fine example of ST doing both.  It deserves its place as the best performing (as I understand it, when adjusted) and is probably the best recognised (after Khan) with the general public, even if that’s just as “the one with the whales”.  

Bravo Mr Nimoy, bravo Mr Meyer for your script polish.",The Voyage Home is a Masterclass
startrek,"coming from someone who likes star trek. a lot. 'juvenile' is the best way to put it. this comes through most in the dialogue. clumsily written and inarticulate, like a child trying to express a very deep thought but lacking the language to express it. you read between the lines and say 'i'll give you a pass because i understand what you were *trying* to say.'

i have complicated feelings toward most of the social allegories in star trek. people who criticize these usually say something along the lines of 'old trek had subtlety, new trek beats you over the head with a moral stance'. ok, fine point to make, we could debate the trueness of that statement all day. personally i think old trek was just as hamfisted; we put up with it because everything else was campy in equal measure. but i think it misses the actual issue, that being that almost every allegory it attempts lacks depth. hate in real life is this complicated web of emotion and bias and circumstance. when trek does a direct allegory it usually goes something like 'x aliens don't like y aliens, because they're y'. childish. you know?

i think this is why my least favourite episodes are ones dealing with large-scale interplanetary conflicts. war is a tricky subject. star trek... tends to swing in the direction of unintentional propaganda. 

to clarify, this isn't about realism. it's a melodrama. i don't seek literal realism in a genre that sets out to be a dim echo of reality at best. i do want it to *feel* real. good fiction will convince you of the most unbelievable things. this particular aspect leaves me unconvinced.",does anyone feel the entire franchise is consistently written in a really juvenile way?

startrek,"So I recently watched Chain of Command and I won't gush too much but suffice to say the episode earns its status and reputation. Strangely despite initially disliking Gul Madred I actually ended up liking him in some sense. I know that sounds weird, but I wasn't expecting him to get the character development that he did, which coupled with the fine acting of David Warner gave a full picture of his character that I appreciated rather than some one dimensional monster. I also like how he actually seems to have a good deal of respect for Picard despite being his torturer and I think some of the best moments in the episode are when he accidentally let's his guard down around Picard. There's almost a strange Stockholm Syndrome dynamic in a way.


However my question lies at the end of the episode in the infamous 'four lights' scene. After being told he is too be released just after one last torturous move by Madred Picard defiantly shouts that there are four lights, despite believing there are three. As Picard is dragged away we see his torturer give a little smile. Initially I assumed he was smiling out of an admiration for Picard, knowing that the respect he had come to have for him was earned, but when the episode ended I reflected on the smile again wondering if Madred knew that he had cracked Picard and was pleased with himself, if he understood that in the end his captive truly believed there were five lights. I'm wondering if anyone else has given this much thought and if so what conclusions you've come to, would love to hear some discussion about this and anything else about the two part episode really. I'm not sure what the general consensus is but I feel like they also gave a good deal of character development to Captain Jellico and I'm glad he wasn't just a straight up asshole if you'll excuse the term. Despite not liking him overall (not disliking either) I actually felt like Riker was being unreasonable at times and maybe a little arrogant, while also seeing both men's side. Very good episode.",I have a character question about Gul Madred in TNG's 'Chain of Command'. Looking for some discussion.
startrek,"Ok, so I know this is probably a foolish question to ask on a subreddit called ""Star Trek"" but I'm doing it anyway. Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek in order? The reason I'm asking this is because I know many of the big moments that happen in the franchise. I know about Spock's death, Kirk's death, ""Kahn!!!!!!!"", Picard's transformation into a Borg, the Voyager making it back to Earth, Data's death, and some other small things. I really want to watch the show because I have a desire to explore and see the unknown, but I'm afraid the series has been ruined for me since I know most of the major plot points. What do you guys think? Should I do it?",Should I watch the entirety of Star Trek from beginning to end?
startrek,"So there’s been a lot of debate about the different captains: Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Sisko.

But what about the second in command, their “Number Ones”?


I’ve taken the liberty of ranking them from worse to worst, and starting off the list we have... 

Riker: Picard’s faithful right hand, who was a little too happy with his lot. Instead of moving up in the ranks, like you’re supposed to, Riker was seemingly obsessed with his captain and stayed on year after year. He passed on multiple opportunities to become captain, despite the problems this created. (Namely: Holding back other officers who wanted to be promoted to Riker’s position.)


Kira: Who somehow managed to become Sisko’s second in command despite having a background as a... Terrorist. Kira constantly second guessed Sisko, and never missed a chance to become involved in some conflict of interest when it came to Bajor. Rather than being a neutral party, Kira would either make enemies of Bajorian political and religious leaders, or become involved with them romantically.


And the worst of the worst?


Chakotay: Who not only joins Kira in having “terrorist” on the resume, but also was so immersed in his ancestral, new age mumbo jumbo, that his spirit animal probably would have made a more competent Commander. 

We’re talking about a man so utterly irresponsible, that he (on at least one occasion) risked the ship and entire crew **because of a peyote fueled vision quest!**",Who was the worst number 1?
startrek,"the Set up of voyager was so unique and had such promise. 2 crews, 1 from a new starship with mostly Junior officers left,  the other a rag tag team of terrorists/ freedom fighters who hate the federation almost as much as the Cardassians. Both crews commanded by captains who couldn't be more different.  Janeyway was a veteran of star fleet but she didn't have a lot of real world command experience. Chakotay rejected an already brilliant career starfleet and embraced being a cold and calculating rebel leader. But with Voyager so far from any allies or supplies they had not choice but to work together to find a way home.  The 2 crews would have amazing conflicts and problems we'e never seen in star trek before. 

Well pretty much all of that was dropped during the first season.  The 2 crew conflicts were entirely dropped and rarely even mentioned again, Voyager's isolation and inability to properly resupplyor repair became more like a continuity error running gag.  Janeway was rewritten to be completely schizophrenic and Chakotay, who was set up and acted so well at the beginning of the show  just turned into stat trek's biggest nothing burger. Voyager isn't star trek's worst series, but it's complete waste of it's immense potential will always be it's only achievement for me.",The wasted potential of Voyager always pissed me off
startrek,"Not sure if this could ""technically"" be considered a spoiler, but better safe-than-sorry I guess.

I'm watching BBCAmerica, and they're airing the famed Bruce Maddox episode about Data's sentience. (""*The Measure of a Man*"") This is the first time I've watched the episode since I started watching Picard.

Now having watched the entire first season of Picard, I find myself watching this episode with new eyes. 

The episode seems to have more weight... seems to be more *special*. 

What do you think? Have you gone back and watched this episode yet? What are your thoughts now, as opposed to pre-Picard?",Does Picard change your view of TNG?
startrek,"1) Where did Maddox get the image for Dahj and Soji

It's established in the first episode that those twins were modled after Data's painting ""Daughter"". This is latter confirmed when they crewe find Maddox at Freecould. However it's also confirmed nobody except Picard had access to that painting. Given his reaction isn't ""Well someone probably space-googled it"", it feels safe to say that was a private painting. Maybe Maddox asked the Data simulation, but then why didn't Data ask someone to be terminated before? When Picard asks if he's immortal Alton states ""we were all listening"". This seems to be a reference to what Data said but it could easily be what Picard said when telling everybody what happened when he talked to Data again after being put into the Golem. We don't see any monitors or ways to look into the Data simulation so the latter seems more likely.

2) Where did Maddox get a neuron from Data's brain?

In the first episode Jurati doesn't believe Maddox could have created any androids becouse he would have needed ""a single neuron from Data's positronic net"" to completely re-create it. While it can be argued this is more symbolic, in the opening credits we see a single ""atom-thing"" split into to and start forming artificial DNA and an eye, which suggests the new android parts are ""grown"" (in pairs) from the one neuron. But it's never explained HOW he got that neuron when Data's body was completely destroyed. Did he venture to the several year old site of the battle from Nemesis and painstakingly look for a single neuron? Did he use B4, and if so why arn't the new androids less developed as that would be re-growing B4's positronic net, not Data's.

3) Why is Data a formless consciousnesses (in universe, it makes sense thematically and for the plot)

I'm perfectly fine accepting Maddox re-built Data's positronic net, then studied and improved upon it to make the superior new androids (contractions, complex emotions, etc). However, when we meet Data again, he's consciousness was restored and put into a ""highly complex quantum simulation"" without any real form. My question is why? If the process of re-creating Data's positronic net (seemingly a physical thing) is actually just restoring code then how did Maddox get any useful information to create the new androids? Not to mention where did he put Data's consciousness if he didn't have a positronic brain for it, as he had yet to study Data. If Maddox did completely restore Data's brain but not his body, why didn't he just build Data a new body when he was able to? Or for that matter build him a ""fully human"" one like Dahj and Soji? Or why not steel B4 when he left and just replace the brains? Or steel Lore for that matter (who was stored somewhere at Starfleet after TNG). They mentioned Data's memories caused B4's net to fail so it wouldn't me murder of any kind.

4) Brain and brain, what is brain?

On a final note Data's new brain doesn't appear to be his old one at all. When Picard pulls the plug, he literally pulls out 3 isolinear-like chips, each one ""ages"" his consciousness. However if the whole point of restoring Data was to study his brain, why is he now stored on 3 chips? You could argue these chips store the simulation while Data is hooked up inside the machine, but then what Picard did isn't death, it's just pulling his off switch which can be turned on at any point. If Data was moved from his brain so Maddox could story it by destroying it then what was he moved to if nobody could build a positronic net that sophisticated?

Now that it's over, I can say I like the series as a whole, but there are a fair amount of major plot points that are just never really explained, even in a Star Trek technobabble kind of way.",Lingering Questions from ST: Picard [PICARS SPOILERS up to finale]
startrek,"I realize it's not officially a separate timeline, but it kind of feels like it. 

In Discovery you have Section 31 operating basically openly, doing shady shit to make the Federation more powerful,  and also the Admirals pardoning a xenocidal tyrannt to get her help in destroying an entire planet to win a war.

In Picard the political leadership reacts with rolling eyes when their own people believe in their stated ideals, and before a space battle, they're telling the enemy that they'll wreck their shit.","In a way Discovery and Picard form a ""Faulty Federation Timeline"""
startrek,"Recently, the moderation staff was talking over the uncharted possibilities of April Fools gags we could feature on the subreddit today. Most of us agreed that, given the global situation, it may not be the right time for tomfoolery. In lieu of a prank or biting satire, we're instead interested in sharing with the community one of the things that Star Trek does best: hope. 

We discussed it and came up with a few episodes that always leave us feeling optimistic and uplifted, and we would love to hear from the community about what in Star Trek can always bring the light, even in dark times. 

##Star Trek: Discovery
* S02E02 ""New Eden"": Pike, Burnham, and Owosekun beam down to a planet of WWIII-era humans who have created an aggregate religion and have left behind science, and only Discovery can save them from an impending natural disaster. In the end, there is an everlasting ember of hope left with the people of the planet, even if they don't all know its true nature. 

##Star Trek: Enterprise
* S02E02 ""Carbon Creek"": In this episode, T'Pol tells an ostensibly apocryphal story about the real first landing of Vulcans on Earth, of her 'great-grandmother' experiencing humans in rural America in the 1950s. The episode is lighter in tone than many of the series, and explores acceptance, learning about new cultures, and discovering things to be cherished in the most unexpected places. 
* S02E24 ""First Flight"": Basically, this episode is what was originally conceived to be the first season, a Star Trek adaptation of  the early NASA missions a la *The Right Stuff*. It's pure Star Trek: optimistic and hard working people who solve a seemingly insurmountable obstacle because they're fueled by the motivation of exploration. 

##Star Trek: the Original Series
* S01E19 ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"": After the Enterprise is thrown back to the 1960s, the crew has to rescue a fighter pilot without damaging the timeline at such an important moment in human history. Somewhat like ""First Flight"", this episode is centered around the 1960s optimism-fuel that was the space race, and predicted eventual missions to Saturn. 
* S02E15 ""The Trouble with Tribbles"": Adorable, funny, sweet, with a kitschy whodunit, it's impossible to finish this episode without a big smile on your face. Particularly for those sheltering with beloved pets, this is a must-watch. 

##Star Trek: the Next Generation
* S05E25 ""The Inner Light"": largely considered one of the best episodes of any series, ""The Inner Light"" is a meditation on life, even the most humble life, and all of its complexity and pain and beauty. The episode is unmissable. 
* S06E15 ""Tapestry"": a personal favorite, Jean-Luc Picard is critically injured on an away mission, and Q shows up to play the role of Clarence in allowing Picard to see what his life would have been like had he made a decision differently. This is a perfect episode to help one process regret and the very ending is one of the most beautiful character moments for Picard. 

##Star Trek: Deep Space Nine 
* S03E22 ""Explorers"": a classic episode of exploration, honoring the explorers of the past, and overcoming adversity, with some beautiful father-son character moments along the way. And having Gul Dukan eat crow at the end is the icing on the cake. 
* S06E14 ""One Little Ship"": hey, remember that time the Rubicon was smaller than a hotwheel and they beat a bunch of Jem'Hadar? It's impossible not to have a great time with this episode. 

##Star Trek: Voyager
* S04E36 ""Hope and Fear"": This episode is about hope, then not hope, then hope again. In this hope sandwich, Voyager is made aware of the USS Dauntless, a Federation ship with an experimental propulsion system that could mean getting home. While all is not what it seems, both seeing the crew given hope by this possibility and the wonderful discovery in the end something wonderful does happen. 
* S06E09 ""Blink of an Eye"": This one's got it all: timefoolery, space-race-era alien astronaut, ancient astronauts, Daniel Dae Kim, and most of all seeing a planet go from pre-Industrial to post-Voyager, and seeing them take responsibility for saving themselves and saving Voyager. And that last shot.

What the ever loving fuck?

This episode features a friendly and advanced alien race that clearly keeps its third gender as chattel slaves. Yet the episode seems to harp on cultural acceptance, and after the Cogenitor’s request for asylum is denied and she kills herslef, it’s framed as some kind of important lesson for Tuck?

Captain Archer ranting about how it’s not our right to judge their culture, feeling like an entirely different character than the one who broke imprisoned Suliban from that concentration camp.

startrek,"Wow, guys. Just wow.

I'm 36, open minded, and want to like this.

Before 2 days ago, I had never seen a full ST episode or movie. I knew about Klingons and Spock's ""live long and prosper"" haha signal. I also knew Professor X was the captain. Aaand that's pretty much it.

Corona yadda yadda, time on my hands. Let's dive in proper. I googled where to start. Everyone says the old school show. Ok. I was shocked to learn ""The Original Series"" was only on the air for 3 years.

5 episodes in, I'm starting to get a feel for the gist of the concept, but I'm absolutely dying. I've already seen the same set used twice. This hurts. I'm spoiled. I know. I keep going. By episode 7, I need something else. I skip ahead to season 3. To episodes in, I can't take anymore. I jump to the first move from the late 70's.

Ok. Now this is where I start to get pissed.

I am sure, back in the day, this was a magnitudinous event. Ten years of no Star Trek, and now a high budget movie. I get it. People were stoked. This, of course, was before my time. I wouldn't know. But I can guess.

Kirk meets Scotty. Oh the joy. Kirk sees The Enterprise... And FOR TEN MINUTES boards it. The epic music. Dragging. Dragging. Oh my God, it's dragging. Then Kirk meets ""Bones"" McCoy. I still don't know why he calls him that. Holy shit, another epic meetup. Then The Enterprise takes off into space in another dull sequence. Oh my God, it's so slow. Then Spock shows up. Great, he's awesome. But he sucks in this movie. WTF - I'm an HOUR into this shit and NOTHING has happened.

startrek,"SPOILERS FOR PICARD/DISCOVERY(maybe)

**Don’t just downvote as nutrek hate, I don’t hate any of it,** I’m just looking for people’s perspective. 

I mean the whole plot of Picard doesn’t really count as world building in my mind. It’s just story telling. They aren’t writing any new LORE (not data’s brother, I mean worldbuilding) 

For instance, today I saw an episode of voyager, the one where belanna visits the barge of the dead. A whole hour dedicated to exposition on Klingon death beliefs and there was another voyager episode where fake kaless shows up, another whole hour dedicated to exposition on the deep inner workings of Klingon society. Not to mention worfs multiple sagas and that’s like I dunno at least 10 more hours revealing the inner workings of Klingon politics, expectations, roles in their society, etc. not to mention ds9 and what we learn about cardassians. Remember that whole episode dedicated to a cardassian lawyer and his daily life in court and we learn about cardassian justice system. We learn so much about these societies and it’s fascinating. 

Then discovery comes along, what do we learn? Klingons bad, unite for battle. That’s.... shallow. A traitor captain in the mix didn’t add anything of interest either... again just story telling. No world building. 

Same in Picard, all we really learn about the romulans is there happens to be a bunch who hate androids and try to kill em. Ok but.... what else? So simplistic and shallow. Nothing built... just a story in the framework of existing lore. 

The universe (of lore) is no longer being built and this deeply disappoints me. 

Anyone else feel similarly?","I feel like 90s/classic trek constantly did “world building”, but modern Trek “only tells stories” in what was previously established. They stopped fleshing out the universe. This is why I feel disappointed in new Trek."
startrek,"Seriously I have enjoyed Enterprise from season 2 onwards, I don't see how it could be so hated while so much stuff is agreed to be worse. While I hated Discovery I disliked a lot of TNG, DS9 and VOY episodes that seem equally terrible so I find it hard to see why a series that seems like a really good entry point to a new viewer or a place for old viewers to find so much hate would be able to take up so much conversation. Some of these episodes are well good and I feel like a lot of them deserve proper consideration

This is not an edit, but for the purpose of your criticism the only series I really genuinely dislike is Discovery. I do dislike individual episodes of the others quite a bit though. Criticise and advise as you see fit","Why is Enterprise so good, and why is it so often left as the worst trek in people's opinions"
startrek,"I have never seen Star Trek before, that was, until tonight when I came across 'Deep Space Nine' on NetFlix.  Just finished episode five where Tosk, whom of which I guess is considered to be an 'alien' that crashed into their region of the galaxy, needed their help woth repairing his ship.

I like the storyline and occasional humor.  The brown dude with huge ears plays a very cool character as well.

Before getting to much further into 'Deep Space Nine, are there episodes I should be watching first?",Just started watching Star Trek (Deep Space Nine) for the first time. I'm in love already.
startrek,"Or is it just because we are all cooped up in isolation because of this pandemic? I feel like the negativity towards the new Trek has been more apparent lately. In general, I can't agree with all the hostility being thrown at PIC or DISCO. My Parents are Trekkies and I grew up watching TNG and VOY. And even though PIC has some imperfections, I really enjoyed the story as a whole. Hell, I'm one of the few who loved DISCO season 2 and cannot wait for Season 3.

But come on people. Can we stop with all this hate towards the new Trek? Yeah I get that times are tough, but don't take it out on Kurtzman and Chabon. They are just as much Trekkies as the rest of us. They might not give you the perfect story, but neither would any of us.

I think the problem that New Trek faces, is it can't just be good, it has to live up and outdo the expectations of any Star Trek fan. An episode of PIC or DISCO isn’t compared to the actual quality of your average episode of TNG or TOS, it’s competing with the concept of ‘STAR TREK’ in the collective memories of Star trek fans.

So PIC, which is basically your average peak-tv era show with some fun ideas and details thrown in, gets seen by so many people through this extreme framing that makes it impossible, for a contingent of people to enjoy it for what it is. This is just my take on why the negativity is so bad. 

And I can't emphasize this enough. This is not an attack on the people who have very strong opinions about DISCO and PIC. I just want to help you guys see that perhaps, you are judging the newest Trek, much too hard. I think there was a lot of good that came form PIC season one. And I think the DISCO has a lot to offer too. I hope we can all try see the positives, among these trying times.",Does this community really have so much distaste for new Trek?

Of course, it wasn't suppose to go bad as it was, but even if all went well, it is at least 2-3 hours lost, during which many thing could go wrong, making them lose more time.

startrek,"I've noticed tensions seem high regarding the series. As someone who didn't like it very much, I thought I'd say some nice things about it.

\-I really liked Elnor. I thought I'd get some cheap shots at the series with a sword-wielding Romulan teenage ninja with a Badass Catchphrase (TM), but they balanced him by showing him as a vulnerable teen who is good at the one thing, but still very young. I liked him quite a bit by the end.

\-Romulan culture. It's weird--well, in character, I guess--that we know so little about the Romulans despite political tension between the Federation and the Romulan Empire lowkey running throughout all of TNG. The notion of rear doors and secret names and ancient demon queens and secret organizations are all aspects of a believable society that bucks the franchise's trend towards being a monoculture.

\-I love Elim Garak, but Narek is the franchise's best spy in my book. He's interested in intelligence, he works assets, he's clever, he solves problems, and he puts aside his personal feelings to do his job. He's an asshole and a Bad Person, but that's the nature of spying. He's miles above Obsidian Order thugs and the omni-competent-because-the-plot-says-so Section 31.

\-Narek's position was an interesting paradigm. He was the one competent person within his organization and also the only one not initiated via deep emotional trauma. It's an analogy for institutional mores and their ability to ostracize rather than learn from deviance. A sharp contrast to what the Federation should be.

\-I liked Seven of Nine. I eventually stopped watching Voyager because of Seven of Nine. I've only picked up a few episodes since and my impression is that as she expressed herself as a person whose personality is determined in no small part by her Borg upbringing that expression is squelched by her captain because it's not ""human enough."" Seeing Seven making her own decisions (for better or worse) and deciding to do something(s) noble seemed real, consequential, and very welcome to me.

\-The interlaced climaxes. Several episodes featured two climactic events happening at the same time with cuts between them. I've seen a few other shows do this (I think Castlevania Season 3 closes out that way), but I haven't seen Star Trek do it before. It was visually interesting and I enjoyed it.

\-Frakes was great. I didn't go in to this feeling as though I needed any particular callback to previous shows, so each one was a treat. Even more than that though, when Frakes said ""shields up!"" my brain thought for a moment that I had Netflix open to a TNG episode in another tab. Dude sent me back in time about 26 years. I enjoyed that they followed up on All Good Things by showing Picard, Riker, and Troi as friends.

\-Troi's is used better than she probably ever was on TNG. Her empathic powers are used to move our story forward and let us express Picard's feelings despite his recalcitrance. Her non-empathic abilities as a counselor are used well to try and help Soji and Picard work together. 

\-Kestra was a welcome character. They had a lot of presence. Also, I watched the episode twice and didn't notice where Kestra was referred to as a 'she' or 'daughter.' I'm positive they were, but until someone corrects me I'm believing they are--despite their affiliation with Thad's warrior women--Trek's first non-binary character.

\-Even putting that aside, Kestra hunts and kills a dangerous creature, which I think is a great touch for kids in Star Trek. They should be as familiar with the elements of their world--the where-does-my-food-come-from and how-does-my-car-go--as we might expect of adults today. Whether that's the woods of Nepenthe or the city of San Francisco, kids who are healthy, fed, and educated since birth should surprise a modern viewer with their knowledge, discipline, and maturity. Kestra demonstrates that and I'm a fan.

\-Those post-Nemesis, pre-Picard uniforms were really nice. I have strong opinions on Star Trek uniforms and they were top tier.

\-Raffi and Rios had a friendship that seemed to grow from a casual association over the series. The moment when she goes to his replicator to get coffee for him instead of booze for herself crystallizes those two being close and it feels like an earned payoff.",I'd like to say some nice things about Star Trek: Picard
startrek,"In this somewhat divisive time in the fandom, can’t we all agree to appreciate Leonard “Bones” McCoy?

He’s the heart of the Enterprise and a gentlemen to boot. He is the most compassionate character in the Original Series, and I would argue, the entire franchise as a whole.

The idea of making him a “simple country Doctor” is actually a genius one. He, through his role as an advisory character, manages to humanise the crew and the show, that at the time ran the risk of alienating the audience. 

When others mention the wonderfully in depth portrayal by Leonard Nimoy, and the charming performance by the Shatner himself, people tend to forget the man who brought such a dynamic character to life.
Deforest Kelley managed to play a grumpy old lovable and kind man we all know and should love.
He set the standard on how the Doctors are written in later shows, and managed to play a hilarious yet important man who always managed to do or say the right thing.

While later Doctors would probably beat him in term of amazing feats, McCoy was always the heart and soul of the Enterprise and became the confidante of one of the popular Captains of all time. 

His speech in Balance of Terror is one of the greatest in tv history. Seriously it’s so good. Go and watch it. It needs to be talked about more. It’s beautiful. 

For these reasons and more, he is my favourite character in the entire Trek universe.",Can We All Just Appreciate McCoy for a Second?
startrek,"35 year Trek fan here. Last year I undertook a complete rewatch of TNG in preparation for the new show, finishing up with Nemesis in January a few days before the premiere. I grew up on TNG and my excitement was through the roof. 

I found Picard to be a solid season of television with some faults throughout, but ultimately satisfying in the end. Despite other people's comments to the contrary, Jean Luc felt very much like Picard to me from the beginning (although changed of course) and it was great to see him become a leader again as the season went on.

Picard season 1 wasn't perfect and I have issues with many aspects of it, from set design to writing decisions, but I always looked forward to each episode and would rate each episode 6 or higher out of 10 (most were probably in the 7 range). Something about the show also felt disjointed from episode to episode at times and I feel like the new characters didn't get enough time to shine/develop. I also think that interesting character aspects, such as Raffi's addiction or most anything about Elnor were completely cut unfortunately. Of course, it has only been 10 episodes so some of these complaints are definitely not fair. I mean look at where the other Trek shows were after 10 episodes!

Prior to the premiere, my expectations were unrealistically very very high. Despite this, I feel like the show mostly met them and I think that says a lot about the great work the writers/directors/cast did.  I also think it is easily Star Trek's best first season.

Bring on season 2!",My Short Picard Review
startrek,"A few months ago I decided to further my Trek education by watching Enterprise. From this subreddit I know it’s not the most popular Trek, but given Voyager is my current favourite, I thought it was worth a watch. I’ll be honest it took me longer to get into, but by the end I’ll admit I liked it. The premise was interesting, and the character development was good. Also Phlox is a delight in every scene he’s in, and as a Brit seeing Reed in Star Trek was very pleasing. 

Anyway, I watched the final episode tonight, and possibly isolation is taking its toll, but I was devastated. Here are my main 3 issues:

1. Simulation
The whole premise of the episode’s story being a holodeck simulation run by Riker really irritated me. The characters I’d grown so attached to being computer programs in their last appearance just felt wrong. His decision to disobey orders was also a league away from Trip’s decision. The whole idea of Riker using a simulation in which he mostly impersonates a chef to make a critical decision just seemed weird.

2. Timing
The timing for the episode was really off. Why did it need to be the day of Enterprise’s decommissioning? Why did it need to be the day of the coalition signing? Six years of adventures just swept over and ignored and it felt very forced. I would have been on board if they fast-forwarded  to the actual forming of the federation, but they didn’t.

3. Trip’s Death 
I know its Trek tradition to kill a major character in a show (Yarr, Kes etc.) but killing them in the last episode is just daft. Especially when its one of the main 3 - the gut punch being entirely negated by it happening a mere 20 minutes before the show ending. What makes character deaths so powerful is watching the characters react and emphasising with them. We got hardly any of that in Trip’s death. It felt so weird and forced I genuinely expected him to emerge from  the shadows and take T’Pol’a hand as Archer gave his speech. 

I understand a lot of my issues stem from it being cancelled before its time. Believe me, I’m no stranger to a rushed ending (I’ve watched BBC’s Merlin) but Enterprise could have ended so perfectly either by just going off into their new adventure (these ARE the voyages) or simply with Archer’s speech in the previous episode.

So there you have it, ramblings about an ending that took place over 10 years ago from someone who barely qualifies as a trekkie. I just wanted to know if the trek community as a whole agreed or disagreed with my view.",Thoughts on Enterprise’s Ending
startrek,"For all people claim that we just want a repeat of TNG, I've never actually seen anyone seriously express this opinion in my 20+ years involvement in this fandom. If anything people criticize ENT and VOY as trying too hard to recreate TNG, and the most popular episodes of those respective shows are the ones that do their own thing.

My issue with Discovery, Picard, and the Bad Robot Films is that they ARE rehashes of the old shows.

Oh boy, another actor to play Spock, another super secret Spock sibling, another super secret Soong family member, tribbles, another evil robot trying to kill the universe, oh boy it's the borg again, oh boy it's klingons again, oh boy it's the mirror universe again, oh boy it's Khan again only he's white this time, oh boy Spock says the Khan line instead of Kirk this time, oh boy it's Sarek again, remember Sarek? I could keep going for days.

Sure, people love to point out episodes like Relics or Unification or Trials and Tribble-ations, but these episodes were exception rather than the rule. By and large Star Trek is not a franchise that references itself often, and even when it does was usually in a way that most people would miss it.

It's notable to me that outside of a couple flashbacks, the Borg never appear in DS9. The Dominon don't show up in VOY or ENT. Outside of a blink and you'll miss it diagram, tribbles never show up in TNG or VOY. These are shows celebrated for their differences rather than their similarities, and the commonalities they do share only serve to enhance the believably of the fictional universe they inhabit. 

I, and I'd wager most Star Trek fans, would have been perfectly happy with a new crew on a new ship boldly going where no man has gone before, commenting on modern political topics like Star Trek has always done. 

Which makes it all the more disappointing that for the last 11 years (and arguably even before that) this franchise has been driving in circles while stuck in first gear, revisiting the same tired characters, same tired tropes, same tired plotlines, and same tired locales. If you took away all the old characters and ""member this"" moments, what would this house of cards have to stand on?

At this point I would be perfectly happy if we never saw Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Tribbles, Klingons, the Borg, Picard, Data, or even the Enterprise itself ever again. I welcome the opportunity for new characters to fall in love with, new ship designs to become my favorite, new iconic aliens to enjoy, and new ideas and political concepts to think about and debate. 

It's a shame I haven't been given the opportunity in a very long time.

If seeing all the old stuff again but with new actors or updated graphics is what does it for you I guess I can't really begrudge you for that. I wish I shared your position, I do like enjoying things believe it or not. But I personally have all my DVD's and BluRays for whenever I wish to relive the past, and more than anything I wish this franchise would give me the opportunity to have new favorites again.",Star Trek is stuck in the past.

startrek,"Early on in the season, I felt that I liked Dahj a lot more than Soji. I thought the feeling was unfounded, they're (almost) the same character, and we barely knew Dahj to begin with. But reflecting on the season as a whole, I feel that the show would have worked a lot better if we'd had Dahj instead of Soji.

Dahj was the everyday character - someone just going about their daily lives, who suddenly has their life upended. She's lost and scared and suddenly apart of something much bigger than she ever imagined. ...A standard sci-fi cliche, sure, but it's standard because it works. Dahj was a bit more relatable and likable for it, whereas Soji had no idea what was going on until 6 episodes in, and then within 1 she had to both come to terms with who she was, and learn to trust Picard. 

Imagine Dahj survives the attempt on her life in the first episode. She now becomes worried for her sister, who she believed worked at a Federation shipyard, but this also turned out to be a lie. Picard promises to help her find and save her sister. 

Dahj is around as the crew is assembled and as they go about looking for Soji. She slowly forms friendships with them in her own way, as she starts to rediscover who she is. At one point she asks Picard about Data, pointing out that with his abilities, he was close to being a perfect human. Picard tells her that Data only used his android abilities when necessary, preferring to do things as humanly as possible. That Data acknowledged that being flawed and imperfect was a significant part of the human experience, as was learning to overcome those flaws.

The Soji/Narek stuff plays out the same, except this time, he successfully kills her. Picard and Dahj get there too late, as the Romulan fleet is off to the Synth homeworld. Dahj is upset over her sister's death, and can't help but to blame Picard. She knows it's unfair, but she can't help but to be disappointed - he promised her, and he let her down.

So when they're on the Synth homeworld, and the other Synths offer her this vision of utopia, she buys into it. She's grieving her sister, disappointed in Picard...what's so great about humans, anyway? They fail and make mistakes and people get hurt because of it.

Picard's appeal to Dahj would then remind her of Data's way of life - accepting failure and flaws, and learning to overcome them. How learning to grow from past mistakes is a part of being human. This would inspire her to believe in Picard and shut down the beacon. And give more weight to the sacrifice Picard was willing to make for her.",Picard: The other sister was better...

What happened to Chakotay? Is he the one that turned her all vigilante with his Maquis mindset? Even the mention of him next season would make me happy.

startrek,"I get that there are a lot of people that like Enterprise or think it's over-hated/underrated. I just don't know if I can watch it right now during quarantine though, the pilot alone made me and my wife quit at the gel-rubbing scene and pick up CBS streaming for Discovery and Picard. 

I have stomached a lot of *hilariously* awful ST plots throughout all the series so far, and nothing in them could have prepared me for how genuinely intolerable and unlikable every character in ENT has been so far. Does it get *any* better for people who are similarly rolling their eyes at the portrayal of the women on the show (not just sexualization tbh) and generally annoyed by the combative nature of everyone on the crew? DS9 and Voyager didn't always have crews be agreeable, cooperative, or even likeable, but it usually was the sum of a compelling plot point, theme, or a character flaw rather than the characters *being the flaw*.

I know the show is already polarizing but ST to me is about philosophy and intellectually stimulating plots, which remain pertinent in the writing even during long war arcs in DS9 or in interpersonal soapy drama episodes of every series. It just doesn't seem like that's in ENT at all. It's like they wanted to make the most boring Michael Bay aspiring sci-fi possible. Is there any hope or should I just skip it? I might go back to it during a less stressful time when I can make ""Space George W. Bush"" into more of a case study but these days I need to actually watch good TV if I watch any at all. I am still laughing at the idea that people actually made this show and that seemingly every single decision about it so far has been completely wrong in the context of Star Trek writing and worldbuilding and characterization.

* In both shows, there is a being causing their time shifting who is also standing judgment on them: Q/Rose Tyler (Bad Wolf)(The Moment)


* In both, the oldest looking version causes the cataclysm (Grandpa/Old Picard)

* At some point, multiple copies of the Enterprise and TARDIS have to team up to achieve their mission

startrek,"I just looked on my Youtube feed and saw a video titled ""Why Star Trek Picard FAILED"" with some 200k views. Instead of linking to it, I'm going to go on a moderately tilted rant.

The people who make these videos are not fans of Star Trek. They exist to farm your views for their own benefit (money).

There is no evidence to support that Picard did bad. Make your own judgments on whether or not you liked it. Every single influencer out there seems to bee unrealistically critical of a show that I enjoyed heavily, and it's creating a toxic (for the lack of a better word, sorry) environment where if TNG came out today, it would be seen as a bad show.

I don't know what these people are expecting, and honestly I don't care.","Star Trek Picard did not ""Fail"", it was in fact a magnificent success (sorry, rant)."
startrek,"1. Filled with incredibly empty 'reluctant hero' gestures: Seven of Nine, Raffi, Rios, and Elnor all had instant ""100% I will not... Okay, I'll go"" moments. This is a problem of writing. Raffi did this shit 3 times.

2. Romulans don't behave like Romulans. It is obvious this is a problem of direction. They behave like humans with some prosthetic ears. The actors appear to be given no guidance as to how a Romulan carries themselves in all other trek.

3. Modern Stylistic/Content choices like: more camera movement, lens flair, hot characters having sexy time, everything looks Green Screen... are okay to have, if it suits the narrative. Instead the camera seems to listlessly move to capture a cool angle when the moment doesn't call for it. This is the problem with Michael Bay. ""Every shot is given equal weight visually."" If everything is of max importance, nothing is important. (Why is it So Hard to Remember What Happens in Transfomers? by Lindsay Ellis provides a perfect example why this is a bad use of film language)

4. Lack of philosophy with an overabundance of attempts to seem profound. This has gotten better in later episodes.

5. At this point it doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. This is a different show. I understand that. Enterprise didn't really feel like Star Trek some of the time to me. But this has very fleeting moments of being Star Trek. Like it is just using the Trek mythology and world very little at that.

6. Picard is not inspiring. This is very jarring to a Star Trek fan and to me diminishes the whole point of the show. This has gotten better in later episodes and perhaps this is a part of the narrative growth for Picard.

7. It ignores the history of the galaxy. Voyagers return and the Dominion War have had no mention or seemingly no impact on geopolitical nature of the Galaxy. 

8. Not talking to the computer and hearing the computer respond is such an atmospheric Star Trek thing that is absent here.

9. Elnor should not have been convinced to leave but rather trying to convince Picard to go with him. This was backwards.

10. Soji &amp; Narek sleep on a way too small bed.

&amp;#x200B;

What Picard is doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Transformation of the Borg to a defeated resource that scavengers are exploiting is really amazing.

2. Agnes is perfect. Her character has been told perfectly so far. The reveal of her romantic connection with Maddox was handled, beautifully and provided my first moment of real emotional devistation. 

3. The EMH's have a similar dynamic that made the Voyager EMH doctor such a good character.

4. The Innari bodyguard (Vop) is a great Star Trek type species. Distinctly NOT Human. Maybe there should be more of this?

5. The Federation fucking itself up so badly by devolving into racism and shitty self-important leaders, would seem impractical... if it wasn't happening so vividly in real life. This is a big plus.

6. The conspiracy unraveling itself is an example of good writing. The ban, the federation, the Romulans hatred of Synthetics. All interesting questions.

7. Stardust City Rag was the first very good episode because of the swerve involving Sevens past with the Freecloud Boss (a very good villain btw). The costuming, the atmosphere, even the pacing was star trek and more importantly good storytelling. When Agnes did the thing at the end (another perfect and justified swerve) I was flabberghasted and all-in.

My wife and I are watching DS-9 - we are both Star Trek fans and have watched pretty much every other series.  We have tried DS-9 in the past and just faded away and started watching something else.  Having said that, it is regularly billed as one of the best Star Trek series around, so we thought we'd give it another go.

We are up to Season 1 Episode 16 and we have been struggling.   The episode where Jake and Nod buy  Cardassian yamok sauce?   We skipped it entirely.  Boring and cringey.

Some of the acting is excruiciating.  Watching Avery Brookes as he ""Enunciates.  Every.  Word.  In.  A.  Sentence"".  Some of the character motivations are hard to understand (Hey, Bashir, we get that you like Dax, but can't you take a hint).  Some of the plot lines end up feeling a bit cringeworthy.

Every Star Trek series took a season or so to get going - TNG wasn't brilliant in its first season, it always felt like an 80s TOS to me but once it got its legs, it was great.  Voyager was stronger in its first season, but also improved over time.

startrek,"In the years after Enterprise, I had two good ideas for Star Trek. One was just a *NEXT* Next Generation. Go on more adventures, with well written stories. I fully reject the concept of Franchise Fatigue. The problem with Trek back then was that the shows simply got bad. But that's not what this is about....

The second idea I had was to have a show that was about the origins of the Borg. But my idea was that it wouldn't be labeled as that. Or even called a Star Trek show. It would be a ""general"" sci fi show about the future that at the end would surprise you by the people in the show ending up becoming the borg.

Today, we are all stuck at home for months. Luckily we have enough technology that we can connect with each other virtually which is good. We are all adjusting our lives so that we can do our jobs and do what we need to do, while minimizing direct contact.

What a great seed for a borg origin story. A virus forces everyone to stay apart and connect electronically.

They even mention in the documentary that they wouldn't be able to get away with some of that stuff today. Not to mention that some of the decisions Sisko made during the Dominion War. Hell, the Dominion War itself. If Nostalgic fanboys are shitting themselves over a Starfleet admiral swearing, imagine their reaction at how Sisko handled the Maquis!

The clash between the fleets felt like a true Star Trek (that classic tension on-screen between the adversaries), but it lasted only seconds. And the death of Picard might have been explored far deeper providing he had died several times during TNG (we DO KNOW how and who could ""restore"" Jean-Luc in his genuine human sleeve). I could only imagine how the series would have looked like if not under Kurtzman production...

In DS9, the ending was mostly anticipated, but implemented a bit better. It managed to wrap up multiple arcs, although in a bit unnatural and puzzling way (and one in just appaling). Sometimes it felt like 4- or-5-episode long story was chopped off awkwardly missing many emotional scenes. Fortunately, far less that in Picard.

In both series, we didn't see the ultimate battle of/with supernatural beings - the major flaw IMO. But unlike the Prophets from DS9, we weren't explained convincingly what was the danger/nature of ""the makers of the Admonition"" in Picard.

I mentioned bad endings for some characters in DS9, but it was dictated by the fact of 7-season long build-up. In Picard, such flaw was of much larger scale: why the hell noone noticed the disappearance of Narek? Why Agnes suddenly dodged the justice of murdering Bruce Maddox? The logic of Soji was just random, she behaves in final episode like drunken teenager who also have bipolar disorder.

The coherence of the events were flawed sometimes in horrendous way.  Picard and Agnes escaped the synthetic guards, walked towards the cube, had a talk, repaired the ship, launched up in front of the Romulan fleet that all the time was doing what?... Meanwhile Soong just busy with routine data extraction and Seven probably meditating over her killing Narissa. 

In this aspect DS9 is even worth: we saw two characters chatting around in a cave - like a 15-minute scene, when a long Galactic-scale battle is raged far away, then ended, the whole fleet went back to docks, war-ending formalities had been made and even a nice party held at Fontain's holosuite... not to mention Sisko suddenly becoming a Jedi who knows how to find exact spot on Bajor to face the enemy who's expects him doing just that!

To sum up, Picard was a bad series which ended up in awckwardly good, ""acceptable"" way. What You Leave Behind, instead, is a tight kaleidoscope, not bad yet still not enough for a brilliant saga.

I enjoyed Et in Arcadia Ego a bit more, mostly emotionally. Despite hating Discovery and all this dung associated with Kurtzman.

startrek,"After seeing the trailer for season 3 of Discovery, i was pretty excited, but some memory in the back of my head was bugging me. It took me a while to retrieve it, but then I remembered Kevin Sorbo doing a slow kick around a black hole and it all came back to me. Andromeda: a sci fi series about a crew from a United ""commonwealth"" of planets, flung into the future where their peace loving system of intragalactic government had failed, trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild a better future. All based on unused story ideas by, what was his name? Ah here it is...Gene Roddenberry. Sound familiar? 

I was surprised to find out the show had 5 seasons! I watched it a lot and liked it as a kid, but I really remember almost nothing from it now. I was wondering in general if anyone else remembered it and if they felt there were any lessons Discovery season 3 should take from a show with a nearly identical story concept.

Or even if you haven't seen or heard of Andromeda, what are your hopes/fears for season 3 of Discovery? I have plenty of both!",Discovery Season 3 and Andromeda
startrek,"So I've had some thoughts after the end of Picard S1, Discovery, the history of Star Trek, the vociferous fanbase, and some issues regarding modern ST creation. I'm going to keep this short so hopefully discussion can happen.

• Modern Star Trek is being made in season-long story arcs because the production company never knows if the plug will be pulled. This to me is sad.  Picard S1 was good, I liked it, but man that whole season could be the entire series. Seven becoming interim queen should have had much more drama around it. Now we're going to get another season of rushed storytelling simply because the writers are likely barred from planning that far out. Can you imagine if in DS9 the Dominion War was only allowed to be one season? It causes rushed story telling, and the overall thing suffers.  
  \- Discovery does this too. Its becoming a theme with ST.

• I really DO love what they're doing though. They are truly creating some proper fan service by going deep in the lore. I love that, there's an entire universe to utilize, no reason to keep making new enemies, things, and what not.

• All in all I'm happy with modern ST. Even with rushed story telling, I'm happy we're seeing modern trek. I do worry the fanbase will serve to destabilize this all though. We need to collectively regulate ourselves.","Many problems, many strengths. Contains general spoilers."
startrek,"SPOILERS

I don't buy the Romulans backing down in the finale of *Picard*. Like, if they seriously believe that the synths are going to bring about a galactic apocalypse, than no way are they going to back down just because of a Picard speech about their rights as sapients and a comparably-sized Federation fleet. If they really believe that the galaxy will be destroyed if they don't act, they absolutely would have opened fire on the fleet and attempted to break through to destroy the planet.

Plus, the synths DID IN FACT ACTIVATE the beacon summoning the genocidal extra-galactic AIs, which would absolutely convince the Romulans that they were right all along in their fear of them. And Narek spent that time narrating the Romulan myth of streets being flooded with the blood and entrails of the innocent because these machines.

startrek,"I just rewatched Nemisis again and as I was watching it I thought that the story really isn't that bad but the fact that Tom Hardy looks absolutely nothing like Patrick Stewart really makes the movie hard to believe.  
  
Despite the fact that Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor it's just too hard to accept that he is a younger version of Patrick Stewart. They have nothing in common. Their voices sound nothing alike, they have totally different accents, different lips, and their facial structure is completely different. They tried to explain this away by saying that Shinzon was disfigured but last time I checked no amount of fighting will give you fuller lips. In fact they only thing that they even had in common at all is that they were both bald although that didn't even make any sense seeing as every time we have seen young Picard had hair.  
  
I think that if they had casted a different actor to play Shinzon people's opinions of the film would be completely different.",Nemesis would have been so much better if the actor they got for Shinzon looked more like Patrick Stewart.
startrek,"First of all, I really like Voyager so far, but hear me out.

The most obvious offender is Chakotay. It seems all he does is talk about his Native American heritage, which would be weird enough in any show, but seems especially odd in Star Trek when we are supposed to be in a post-nations post-racial future. There is a TOS episode where Abraham Lincolm remarks about Uhuru being integrated into the crew, but Kirk and all the others are so advanced in their thinking they can't even understand what Lincoln is talking about.

This would be less of an issue if Chakotay has a more defined character, but after watching a season and a half all I can tell you about him is basically a series of Native American cliches, with none of the characterization you would expect from a leader of rebels.

He's a pretty common complaint, and I get that the writers were scammed but a fake consultant, but I think theres a few other odd issues in Voyager.

The character of Tuvak seems vaguely racist to me in that the show runners seemed to think that simply making a vulcan black was a character trait. I mean its great to have a diverse cast, but so far there is nothing to differentiate him from Spock, or any other generic Vulcan, except for his skin color. It almost seems to me, the showrunners said, hey lets have a black vulcan, and then stopped writing there. Contract this to the great characterization of Geordi, whose skin color is literally irrelevant to his character. I can tell you that he is a good friend, probably the nicest TNG character, and bad with the ladies. I cant tell you a whole lot about Tuvak.

Please note im not really complaining or calling Voyager racist really. Most of this I think is just mediocre writing. I just find it interesting that it was clearly well intentioned but went wrong, and wrong in ways previous crews from earlier eras didn't go as wrong. Also things you should be aware of if you are writing anything...",Is Voyager accidentally racist?

Visually it looks awesome and realistic if it were possible to do such a thing but I still prefer the older style of a ""Get up to Speed"" way and slowing down gradually like in the TNG/DS9/VGR era of Star Trek. It would have been a little bit more cooler to see Rikers new ship to come swooping in to save the day like how the Enterprise E did in First Contact when the Borg invasion on Earth was happening. The way they do it now is the ships instantaneously pop into a exact place and disappear instantly. Anyone else feel the same way?",How starships go into and drop out of Warp Speed
startrek,"We start with the stand off between the Romulans and Riker, only this time Cmdr Oh says ""Hell no, I am not backing down! These synths have a switch to end all life in the galaxy! This is unacceptable to us!""

Riker says fine, we will commence to destroying your fleet then. Cmder Oh then claims she has a small fleet on standby near earth ready to seed earth's atmosphere with poisonous radiation if they do so. Riker accuses her of bluffing. She reminds him she infiltrated the deepest reaches of Star Fleet and no one was the wiser, it would be foolish to assume she is bluffing. 

Stand off. 

Picard chimes in and proposes that the communication tower to call Cthulhu is destroyed, all tech and info related to it is destroyed, and that the knowledge of the ability to call the interdimensional destroyers is completely erased from the memory banks of all synths. 

The Synths have a conference and accept this under once condition - The Federation remove the synth ban and give synths full citizenship. 

Picard talks to Federation big wigs, they agree. 

AI Soong oversees the procedure as one after another of the synths has the knowledge permanently removed and all the tech is destroyed. ONce that happens, Cmdr Oh is satisfied, she backs down and returns. 

This way everyone (mostly) gets what they want and the Romulans are not portrayed as 2 dimensional bad guys which bothered me. And the synths gets restored without the Federation simply saying ""oh you almost very nearly destroyed all life in the galaxy? Great, then we lift the ban!"" which wan an absurd plot point.

Say there’s a Betazoid in StarFleet whose job was to make contact with new life. If they could read their minds, wouldn’t it just be gibberish to them?
 The universal translator wouldn’t affect their thoughts presumably.
So how then can they seemingly read the minds of nearly anyone without the issue of a language barrier?

Also what’s the law regarding telepaths? Surely on their planet most crime wouldn’t exist considering they don’t really lie all that much. (At least to each other.) Could a Telepath be used in a court of law? We know this happened during the Klingon War, but that was in desperate times.

Side note considering it takes them until adolescence to develop their abilities, do you think the children try to lie? At least to each other? Or is it just so completely alien to them that they wouldn’t consider it?

I was going to watch Voyager after DS9, but every time I go to watch the first episode, I hesitate, think about how I'm not gonna hear the DS9 theme anymore, then I exit the tab. DS9 was so good! I wish there was more of it. A lot of shows these days have like 20 seasons. I wish DS9 was one of those shows, bringing new characters in over the seasons. 

It would've been so cool to see Kira as the commander of DS9 for a few seasons, then maybe the return of Sisko and finally seeing the Bajoran integration into the Federation, as well as the Federation occupied Cardassia.

startrek,"TL;DR - The way she saves the day is by using her abilities to effectively steer Picard away from bad decision making (especially within his specialty of negotiations), to make him aware of things he would otherwise not be able to perceive, and to essentially save the crew from disaster by avoiding it in the first place rather than solving the crisis after it's a problem.

Many people in this fandom seem to view Troi less than favourably. I won't speak to any reasons other than frequent mentions of her generally not being very useful.

I know a lot of you will be prompted to disagree that this is the case, but we can only speak from personal experience and this is the point of view I'm coming from so if all you're going to say is ""what? everyone I know loves her"", I hear you, save your effort.

I'm rewatching TNG and it's occurred to me why this might be, even though in my opinion it is wrong. It seems like there's a key difference in how Troi is useful as opposed to the other characters around her.

For example, Data, Geordi and Crusher tend to chew on a problem and propose or create actionable solutions to solve the main crisis.

Picard likes to have a last-minute revelation and think or talk his way out of a problem, while Riker and Worf tend to be more action-oriented and reactive in their heroics. All these characters often get their moments in a very memorabel, climactic way.

I don't think it can be overstated how useful Troi is, just in a way more subtle and totally different way. Her moments aren't as easy to remember, but they are way more frequent than most other characters.

Sure, sometimes she doesn't have very much to offer when asked her opinion (I won't get into how that is also useful sometimes) but it's worth noting that she is indeed repeatedly asked.

Often she has helpful insight, which may seem obvious points to us based on storytelling clues but are at least helpful in confirming what Picard may be guessing at.

But more frequently, she is actively useful in bringing forth new information the crew wouldn't have otherwise, including sensing certain things on an entirely imperceptible level to the rest of them. They'd be screwed without her in many cases.

Her abilities can't be overlooked. I don't need to walk anyone through why her abilities are useful in theory, any level of mind reading is obviously an asset. But I've never seen anyone go out of their way to point out how finely tuned her senses are, sometimes she is very specific in her descriptions (even though the meme is that she is always vague, or else just stating the obvious).

Not only are they specific, they're also broad and powerful. She can feel and sense things thousands of kilometers away, from thousands of individual complex entities at a time. On top of everyone in the ship around her. That would take incredible strength to handle and would make her an incredibly useful asset especially in her job which, by the way, is also a very necessary thing to have on a ship out in space that long even if it were a position filled by a human.

This won't be news to most of you but I know some people need to hear it.",In defense of Troi
startrek,"As is well known at this point, the premise of Breaking Bad was simple: turn Mr. Chips into Scarface. But how it would be done or what would happen along the way wasn't predetermined. Instead, the writers wrote organically. As described in countless behind-the-scenes podcasts and interviews, in determining how to create the story, the writers simply asked themselves episode to episode, ""Where's a character's head at?"" and ""What happens next?"" The television equivalent of one-step-at-a-time. This way, character choices and plot moves seem plausible, and the characters gain depth.
Contrast this with Star Trek: Picard, which seems to have been created with a checkbox approach. We need to get them from here to here, so what can we come up with to make that happen? Or we want to establish this about this character, so what can we come up with to show that? Check, check, check. This approach is what leads to moments not feeling earned. This is how you end up with plot holes. This is how you end up with thinly-written characters, poor pacing, and coincidences that are too hard to believe. I am certain that 80% of the problems that people have with this show are the casualties of this writing approach. The most blatant example to me is Elnor. He's fine as a character, but there's no reason he needs to be on the crew other than the writers decided it would be cool to have someone like him round out the team. And what you end up with is this huge detour to pick him up, some maudlin backstory to establish their relationship, and some forced drama about whether Elnor will go with him or not. Another example is the writers wanting to establish that Raffi has some past demons to contend with. Insert dramatic scene with son. Check.
If you're going to revolve a whole television series around a character, and declare upfront that it's meant to be a slower, character-driven show, then the writing approach should match. As it is right now, it's like the show is constructed by patchwork, and I can feel and see every seam. ",Recommendation to Picard's showrunners: adopt Breaking Bad's approach to writing.

Long story short: Organics built tech, tech became consious, both fight, organics loose, tech hibernates for 50k to kill everything that could be a threat... repeat.

At the end of the third game  we face 3 different endings:

1. Destroy the reapers and ALL (!) synthetic life, even the friendly one
2. the hero(ess) takes control over the reapers, in exchange for sacrificing his/her body. The hero becomes an AI himself/herself and the reapers become ""slaves""
3. Synthesis of organic and synthetic life forms. All lifeforms (organic and synth) merge and form new lifeforms (but they keep the apperiance). In fact, Humans e.g. end up as creatures like Picard is at the end of Season 1.

A lot of Picard reminded me of Mass Effect: Synths fighting for their lives and rights (Geth), while others see them as threats and mortal enemy (Quarians/Romulans). A hidden species that will arrive and will kill everything organic (Reapers), an awesome spaceship (seriously, the La Serena kinda looks like a Normandy-Knockoff/Hommage) etc.",Am I the only one with a massive Mass Effect 3 Flashback after watching Picard?
startrek,"so I grew up a star wars fan but as I got older I’ve had the urge to dive into star trek. I love scifi in general (mass effect, firefly, galaxy quest, etc.) and i’m always looking for more. for some reason tho the star trek world has always felt overwhelming for lack of a better word. is there a good place to start?

startrek,"I just wanted to say that, as a UK viewer, i've had to go to some lengths to avoid spoilers for ST:Picard. Every Thursday I had to remind myself to unsbscribe from r/startrek and r/DaystromInstitute, and I had a long list of muted words on Twitter: ""#STPicard"", ""Romulan"", ""Soji"", etc etc. Unbelievably I was 100% successful, and barring the trailers and the next time segment on the Ready Room I came to each episode entirely fresh and unspoiled.

Then, this week, Jonathan Frakes posted to Twitter a photo of himself in a captain's chair, in the sweet new Starfleet uniform, with the caption ""Social distancing"" - neither of which were, obviously, among my muted words. I don't even follow Frakes but there he was in my timeline.

And you know what? It's fine. Not because it was a fairly predictable plot development (although it was), but because somehow Jonathan ""no fucks given"" Frakes carelessly dropping plot spoilers has become such a tradition that it would almost be disappointing to me if he didn't. And he looked damn good back in uniform.",Thank you Frakes
startrek,"I had this moment, just now...a panic-induced break with reality from endless weeks of anxiety and sleep deprivation - and it dawned on me that this feels like we're living out one of those episodes of TNG where Q tries to amuse himself by tormenting JLP with one of his trademark, impromptu (and unwelcome) visits.

And, for a brief moment, I thought: wouldn't it be nice if this were just a brief segue in Q's megalomaniac pursuit of entertaining is immortal self...so that there would be a terminable, foreseeable end in sight for all this misery?",Q is never around when you need him
startrek,"I think I've got a different take on Picard... and it relates back to Discovery and the Kelvin timeline.

I went in to Picard with HIGH hopes, and was fully let down, but I couldn't identify why. I think all new generation of ST content has become ""Star Wars"" more than ""Star Trek"". Many people argue, ""Hey old man, the new ST is great! It makes it more accessible to new fans! Just be happy to grow the base!""

I'm actually **happy** there are people who enjoy the new content. That's nice! But old ST was in a totally different genre than Star Wars. To grossly oversimplify, Star Wars is an underdog story. (Bear with me... please forget what you've heard about ""the hero's journey"" which I argue is just an epic version of the underdog story). When you look at Star Wars... or Fast-and-Furious... or Avengers... it's all about being the underdog. The protagonist(s) fight against an impossible foe and then rise above all obstacles overcome the big-evil. It's a great conceit. It's why the new ST is so accessible for new fans. Who doesn't love a good underdog story?

But that's not classic ST. TOS crew were explorers... and they had confidence. They were part of the noble Federation. They may be isolated, and get into trouble because they were on the frontier, but BEHIND THEM was the full weight (and moral fortitude) of the Federation. The story basically set itself up as... ""okay, we've solved all those other basic conflicts in life. There's no push for basic survival, or wealth, or power, or resources. Now we focus on exploring what's-out-there, and at the same time we explore what-it-means-to-be-human, what-we-can-aspire-to-be."" (Exploring both inner and outer space).

So why the new ST iterations are disappointing *for me* is that I went in with different expectations. It'd be like walking into the next Fast And The Furious and getting a light-hearted rom-com. Or going to see the next Avengers movie and getting a teen coming-of-age-story. Even if the rom-com F&amp;F was faaaaantastic, I'd wager the folks that walked in there expecting high-octane action would be let down.

So in conclusion, I'm **happy** that new fans can get a story line they find exciting and engaging while watching Disco, Picard, or Kelvin. I'm happy there's people that can get to know Kirk, Picard and Burnham^(\*ahem\*), and see them as heroes. I wouldn't want to take that away from anyone. I personally don't find Star Wars all that engaging, but look at the fan base! I'm stoked all those folks can find so much joy in the SW saga. I just hope at some point there will be more content (Star Trek or otherwise) that focuses on the human element of exploration, and doesn't feel the need to make another underdog story.",Picard is not my Star Trek (and that's okay)

startrek,"I thought S1 of Picard was good and at times bordered on excellent, but I can't be the only one hoping that S2 has a more serialized format. Maybe Doctor Who style where there are big over-arching season long stories, but told through smaller vignettes that let us just hang out with the characters a little bit. I think the cast they have assembled is great,  I want to get to know what they are like when not in a life and death race to do . . . something.

I remember watching one of the Kelvin Timeline films (I honestly can't remember which) and there was a throw away line about some little adventure that they went on where they didn't blow up the Enterprise and I realized how much I wanted to see that. That cast also had great potential, but for me the fun of trek is seeing the dynamics of these great people being people and working together to do the thing because it was right, not necessarily because the fate of the universe hung in the balance. I want to see Rios and Picard disagree about something where the stakes aren't so high, but neither of them is wrong and you get to see their points of view.","Picard S1 was good, now can we get more monster of the week?"
startrek,"Am I the only one who finds that the ships on 'Picard' and 'Discovery' look really different from the Trek designs in the TNG/DS9/VOY era?

The ship designs in TNG era by Andrew Probert, Greg Jein, Rick Sternbach were in my opinion elegant, weighty and memorable. Think of the designs for the Enterprise-D Galaxy-class, Romulan D'deridex, Klingon Vor'cha. They were instantly memorable, beautiful to look at from every angle.

And you could trace each ships' design language back to the classic era Star Trek ships - the Vor'cha class was an evolution of the iconic K't'inga class from The Motion Picture and TOS tv show. The Galaxy class and (its contemporary Starfleet ships) were an evolution from the TOS Constitution class, adopting the graceful curves of the movie-era Excelsior, Miranda and Oberth classes. Even the D'deridex took the TOS 'bird' motif and made it into a literal 'Bird-of-Prey' personified.

Throughout the TNG-DS9-VOY-ENT history, Star Trek has always followed and honored a consistent design language. You can see this rule followed in the rest of the lesser seen ships - the Nebula-class science ships, Akira-class battleships, the Olympic-class (Pasteur) medical ships, the Klingon Negh'var ships and even the runabouts and various shuttlecrafts that launched from the Ent-D and Voyager shuttlebays.

For a show that is happy to build on / make money off of us fans' (enormous) goodwill from the Star Trek canon, the new VFX / Starship design team seems perfectly content to piss on Star Trek's rich design history, and come up uglier and more forgettable designs. I got my first taste of this with Discovery, when the Federation and Klingon ships were a bunch of clashing colors, all-too-busy design details that belonged more in a Michael Bay Transformer robot travesty, than on any recognizable Star Trek.

I had hoped that Picard would turn the tide, and bring us a long-awaited return to the TNG-design language, but the ship designs for the La Sirena, Riker's 200 copy-pasted fleet, and to a lesser extent the Zhat Vash's Romulan fleet all had forgettable designs that made me think they were made quickly, digitally, in a mercenary fashion. They did not seem crafted lovingly by their sculptors from hand, as I'm sure Probert, Sternbach and Jein had to, in the 80s and 90s. Many in our subreddit pointed out that Riker's fleet looked like a poor digital kitbash of Star Trek Online ships, and I have to agree.

Every time I see ships in 'Discovery' or 'Picard', I have to wince a little at the poor, bland, or messy designs and try to paint over it with better designs in my head. Surely the shuttlecraft in 2399 flying over the Golden Gate Bridge cannot look worse than the ones in TNG S2-S7? And surely they don't have to sport bright red spots of paint that make them look like off-brand imitations of the real thing? This reminds me of how the J.J. Abrams TIE Fighters added unnecessary spots streaks of paint, making them worse than the iconic TIE Fighters of the original SW trilogy.

Without an explanation for the regressions in design, I'm forced to conclude that either Star Trek's new batch of VFX people are incompetent ship designers, or they have little to no respect for the Star Trek history and ships that became before, and are determined to force in their own, original lesser stamps on the franchise.

And speaking of VFX, how is it that hand phasers in 'Picard' have reverted to bullet-style pulses? Is it because assault rifles are in vogue in today's world, so 2399 uses pulse weapons too?

And in the few moments we see traditional 'sustained' phaser beams used in starship battles on 'Picard', they sound tinnier/wimpier than the phaser sounds from the TNG-VOY era. In addition to losing VFX language, did the 'Picard' team lose the sound .wav files from the TNG era too, or did they think their new sound effects were superior?

It's all very baffling, and these poor design choices gnaw at me during my watches of 'Picard' and 'Discovery'. When Wil Wheaton interviews the VFX designer for 'Picard' and presumably 'Discovery', who seems rather proud of his messy VFX work, I find myself actively hating on that person, and wishing I could punch them in the face and give them a wake up call.

I don't believe that CBS skimped on their budget to make the ships beautiful. The production values on both 'Discovery' and 'Picard' seem movie-quality. It seems like no expense was spared. And the big piles of cash Netflix and Amazon Prime forked over for exclusive global streaming rights surely would have paid for a good VFX team.

I don't want to dump on the VFX team too much. I do think the holographic controls used in 2399 Starfleet are a good update to the starship consoles we saw on TNG-DS9-VOY. And Rios/Cristobal manages to make those controls look cool while piloting the La Sirena.",Starship designs and VFX on 'Picard' and 'Discovery'
startrek,"I’m a huge Ned Gen fan and I think I would really enjoy watching either/both VOY and DS9. However I find it really hard to get into new shows. The way my partner got me into watching TNG was by showing me a few of the coolest episodes. This way I knew I was in for a great adventure and I was willing to go through season 1-2 to get to the stuff. 

Im hoping you all can do the same thing for me with these other series.

startrek,"because Patrick Stewart sees something great in the show's potential. He believed in it enough to bring back his character after twenty years. I would say I see that potential in a lot of the cast. Like others have said, I would totally watch a show starring Rios. I also know the show has a finite end, so that gives me some hope.

What's frustrating is the writing, which I know is a big deterrent for a lot of folks. It's obvious to me that the writers are trying to find their footing in the vast Star Trek universe and had bumps along the road. I also think the show would have been much better if it wasn't 10 episodes, and was the traditional 20-22 per season because the pacing would have made more sense. However, given the budget of the show it doesn't seem like that was realistic. 

And at the end of the day, how many of us sat through the first seasons of TNG? Voyager? DS9? All the first seasons of those series were hard to watch for me. I genuinely believe season 2 will be better and hopefully they'll look over the scripts. It would be great if they brought in some of the writers from DS9 too.

startrek,"To be blunt I didn't like Picard very much. I went in with high hopes that were killed off after the first episode. Remembrance was like a new spin on a favorite comfort food. There was enough nostolgia to scratch that itch and enough newness that made it feel different to TNG. Episodes 1-3 were mostly pleasant and then for me it fell off a cliff, with each coming episode a rock hitting me on the way down. 

If it wasnt for for the old cast and crew of TNG and VOY I wouldn't even have watched the rest of the season. None of the new characters had time to breath and develop. Agnes was forgettable. Rios was just another hot headed Latino stereotype ala Po in the Star Wars sequels. Raffi downright creeped me the hell out for some reason. I found her switching from drunken junkie to mother figure (while well acted and would totally work in something like Moonlight) out of place and jarring in this show. Seven I felt was reduced down into kick-ass token LGBT character who for some reason without any development or explanation is hooking up with Raffi? 

And finally there is the man himself Picard who is a broken down husk of himself. The man who was assimilated by the Borg, lived a lifetime in 20 seconds, and saved the Galaxy from certain doom numerous times now is told to fuck off at every chance and is berated in front of the entire galaxy on the evening news. Most of the time Picard in this new series took a backseat turning into a secondary character on his own damn show. The only times when I began to become slightly engaged with his character was when there were TNG call backs and in the finale when he took command of La Sirena (which made me smile).

I get it that all of the characters are suffering through some sort of trauma and the message of how we as individuals and as a society can become cold and distant after trauma is utterly brilliant. It's far better than TNG's Troi rape of the week and move on. But the format of ten episodes completely kills any chances of meaningful character interaction. It's structure is go go go and two minutes of heavy crying. The show didn't feel contemplative like it was advertised, it was a two hour blockbuster movie with eight hours tacked on to blow the special effects budget. Not once did I feel that the main cast was a crew, everyone felt like asshole grifters coming together for a paycheck from the old man. When Picard was dying all I could keep thinking was ""please no, not here with these people!"".

Compare that to Discovery which I didn't like that much either for reasons already well known but had it's moments even in the first episode of season 1.  It was apparent that the crew of the Shenzhou were a family and Michael betrayed that trust to her crew and the federation as a whole. Throughout season 1 she works to regain the trust of her family in both Saru and the federation.  Season 1 also had a great bottle episode ""Magic to make the sanest man go mad"" and the other away mission episode with the sentient resonance plants. Season two worked on that Bond between the crew with scenes like the auto antonym game between Lionel and Reno. Or even the humble brag Michael messaged to Tilly regarding her command test scores. Hopefully season three continues building on that good foundation.

Call me stuck in the past but Star Trek really works when the crew is a family. What made TOS so unique to other Scifi is that the Enterprise was not only a spaceship but it was a home and the crew was a family. Without that Trinity or ensemble of characters it isn't Trek it's just Scifi with trek looking ships.",[Spoilers] St:Pic is making me like Discovery more
