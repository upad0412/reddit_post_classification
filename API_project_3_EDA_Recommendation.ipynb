      "Backstory- I was looking through some old, scrapped scenes from season 7 (some trashed story arcs, some altered scenes that didn't make the cut) and I came across an older version of Episode 5, wherein Trace is instead a male character named Nyx, who was apparently cut do to being to similar to Han Solo and the fact that Ahsoka already had a love interest. You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?\n",

      "It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to watch most of the show and just kind of ignore the stuff with him? Or is he really integral to the show overall? I know I may be stubborn...but to me, Darth Maul is dead! (There are other things I didn't like in the show as well, that was just the one that finally made me give up...but maybe I should give it another chance...)\n",

Yes they are enjoyable like The Mandalorian or even TCW but I think people should not care too much about wether something is Star Wars or not. If you want to know the real meaning of Star Wars, it’s about letting go. To let go of attachments, feelings and to serve the greater good. If art is the representation of one’s belief, that means this has been the true meaning of Star Wars, as George has expressed his wishes for people to “be more rationale” as he describes how you must avoid the allures of riches, such was the case of his early years writing Star Wars, avoiding job offers which would have distracted him from his film goals.\n",

However, I remember the one time Obi Wan decided to pull an Anakin and disobey the council,  it literally caused Satine to get killed. Obi wan probably believes that it was his fault for getting Satine killed by disobeying the council and trying to rescue her by himself. What are ya’lls thoughts?\n",

      "A \"what if\" show similar to the Marvel one coming out on disney+ would be a good idea. For anyone unaware, what that's doing is changing one thing in each MCU movie from Iron Man to Far from Home and basically making an alternate universe. I think there's potential there to not only adapt the movies kinda like those comics a while back, but add some legends stories in animated form. How cool would it be to see the OG Thrawn trilogy as a part of the show? So many other possibilities too. New Jedi Order, X-wing, Yuuzhan vong war, even Shadows of the Empire could work. That's what Lucasfilm's next TV show should be, it could appeal to both Disney fans and Legends fans. The Disney fans would enjoy seeing movies like Rogue One, TFA, TROS, etc with a different spin, and the legends fans would love seeing characters like Thrawn, Corran Horn, Kyle Katarn, Dash Rendar, Mara Jade, and more on the screen, overall, if done well, this could bring both sides of the fandom together and be something truly amazing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This would not be difficult to work into the story, and I think it would be incredibly important to add. Coruscant could be the last hold out for the First Order troops. They could be led by a familiar character, possibly Nash Windrider of Lost Stars? This book would be a great way to dive into some characters who lacked screen time in TROS, especially Finn, and they could even add the storm trooper rebellion. Not hating on episode 9 as I personally enjoyed it, but this is probably the post-9 content that I want to see the most and I think a lot of people would be happy with it.\n",

He died at the hands of an experienced imperial general. JJ used what Rian gave him and I think Hux was used well in both movies.

For example, most articles written say that \"most fans hate the prequels\", but that is no longer true. Older fans don't like the prequels but younger ans who grew up with them love them. Many even say revenge of the Sith is the best movie. There are prequel fans all over the internet. Now it is a pet peeve of mind to use the terminology \"most fans\" or \"fans agree\" anyway (no one truly can speak for SW fans as we are a diverse group) but even when they do the statement is followed by something that is no longer true, which makes the writer seem even more out of touch.

But the mainstream follow up to A New Hope was the Holiday Special, one of the worst creations under the Star Wars brand. The Holiday Special proved that Star Wars didn't immediately equal good and yet, Empire overcame that. There could very well have been a terrible comic relief character or a musical number, both of which we've seen in Star Wars. Instead we got what some consider the best action movie ever. It bore little similarity to A New Hope so not only was it good, it had a new identity. Good job to Lucas, Kershner, Kasdan, and every other crew member involved.\n",

      "\n",
      "Which is honestly how I see the presentation of Luke in the last Jedi when it comes to using his failures as an example. Because remember when Yoda told him that it was before he force projected himself to Crait. The actions on crait, which at least start his redemption and path back to the person I was hoping to see more of, come later and while they are how a Jedi should act they aren't what Yoda is saying Rey should learn from. \n",

Their is nothing there to make a person want to aspire to be Luke Skywalker or be like him (again their is Crait but that isn't part of Yoda's message and Rey's lesson).\n",
      "\n",
      "When Luke is on the Island he is trying to push Rey away and gives a (very slanted) history of the order and the fall of Anakin but he offers no way to fix it. No postive change that can be done. Same when he talks about his failings as a teacher. No example of a change. No conversation about what he done right. \n",

      "\"failure is the best teacher\" comes more off to me like that cartoon of the woman pointing out the homeless man to her kid and saying \"Do good in school so you don't end up like him\" \n",

      "Its all about Luke's failure and nothing about what he did right or what he learned from it and how Rey should not make the same mistakes its just \"don't be like Luke and the Jedi because they are bad\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Crait does give a good example of being Luke but again that isn't part of the message. Heck that's even more about being a message of hope to the galaxy at large not really about the Jedi Order. So it feels like at least from TLJ Luke would be used as a example of what future jedi don't want to be, a warning to students not someone to aspire to be like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully the VD for TROS fixed that a bit to where Rey does have his notes and journals in the Sacred Texts which means the new order will at least be using something positive he left. And he has talked to Rey more and does go more into how his image on crait helped. \n",
      "\n",
      "So it doesn't seem like he will be just a example of what a Jedi Shouldn't do/be. But taking TLJ by its self and that quote by its self that is really what it felt like to me. Like Luke Skywalker was a example of everything Rey and her Jedi should not be or do.\n",

      "The lack of a scar on Rex at this point means that he has not yet taken out his chip. Additionally, in the trailer we see Ahsoka stanced up on the bridge of the cruiser and Rex on the ground. This implies that Rex receives Order 66 and fights himself out of compliance while Clones attack Ahsoka. I think Rex will beg Ahsoka to remove it for him, or even at some point beg Ahsoka to kill him (way too unlikely imo since it doesn’t seem in his character but Rex is about to go to a SUPER dark place). Thoughts? \n",
      "\n",
      "I also have been thinking for a while and the possibility that Ahsoka swipes along his head with a lightsaber seems possible but unlikely given her combat skill and just how dangerous it is. But, given Rex is on the ground in pain without a helmet her being caught off guard could be a time to see it. Initially I actually thought we were gonna see Rex intervene in the Maul fight and he would be hit with the Darksaber on the head. Would’ve been a nice emotional scene with Rex on the ground and Ahsoka thinking Maul just killed him. Brings emotional gravity.\n",

They made expectations that they didn't live up to, forced us to make too many assumptions, and threw away plots that they could have easily used.\n",

THEY ALIENATE (pun intended) HUGE SECTIONS OF THE FAN BASE, BASICALLY SAY THAT \"Men are bad\", COMPLAIN THAT \"Fans are so entitled\", EITHER DON'T INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS OR KILL THEM OFF, PUSH AGENDAS AND MAKE THESE FRANCHISES LOW-QUALITY, CASH GRABS OF REBOOTS WITH PAPER-THIN CHARACTERS, POOR QUALITY PLOTS, AND FRICK UP THE ORIGINAL CONTINUITY. THE PREQUELS WERE BETTER. EVEN MICHAEL BAY'S TRANSFORMERS WAS A BETTER REBOOT THAN STAR WARS AND GHOSTBUSTERS (2016). AT LEAST HE DIDN'T TRY TO PUSH AN AGENDA, HE DIDN'T TRY FOR PAPER-THIN CHARACTERS OR LOW-QUALITY PLOTS. HE DIDN'T ALIENATE THE FAN BASE. HE DIDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT ENTITLED FANS.

      "On the morning before I saw ROS  I was watching SNL Weekend Update from the night before.  The setup to one joke was about how the new Star Wars movie had the franchise's first gay kiss.  I immediately closed the video before hearing the punch line.  I was pretty pissed because I made it this far without knowing anything about the movie and this one stupid thing got through.  I mean I know its no \"Luke I am your Father\" or anything but understand I go out of my way to know NOTHING about these movies before seeing them\n",
      "\n",
      "So I assumed the joke had to be referencing Poe and Finn since I remember reading \"speculation\" that they might be gay from somewhere at sometime.  This assumption was all but confirmed from the very first scene of the movie where they bickering like a cliche married couple.  I was kind of bummed that I already knew the big reveal sure to come at the end but whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scene after scene kept reinforcing that these two were secretly in love.  Like when Finn goes \"Rey I need to tell you something!\" as he's sinking in mud.  Clearly he was desperate confess his relationship with Poe, not wanting the secret to die with him.  And all the scenes with Poe and his ex girlfriend and how she was heartbroken yet forgiving?  Clearly Poe ended their relationship abruptly when coming out as a gay man.\n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm not sure if anyone has thought of this as a mechanic, but the way we think of damage in Star Wars games from lightsaber combat is that the lightsaber strikes the combatant during battle, maybe this is stupid on my part but what about introducing a damage mechanic where the combatant doesnt actually take damage from hitting the character (like how a real Star Wars battle would be irl) but instead of a damage bar, a stamina bar that you would have to drain to get a hit which would end the battle. Let me know what you guys think. Maybe it's a bad idea but idk I just thought about this while watching Fallen Order gameplay.\n",

      "Not exactly a good analogy, but... take Galactus, for example. He appears differently based on the individual looking at him (that's why to humans, he looks like a weird purple giant human guy). In actuality, he's an immutable, essential part of the universe. \n",

      "I'm guessing different alien Jedi (and even Siths) think about, view, and use it differently,\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: additionally, some aliens are bound to serve the concept of emotion differently, or not at all.

      "I started rebels 4 days ago with very low expectations. From what I had seen of the show it had its moments but they were very few and far between. After watching all four seasons I realize that though this was partially correct, there was much more story and lore than I originally expected and I ended up thoroughly enjoying the show. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I loved were all of the callbacks to the Clone Wars. All the, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, references to battles and characters from the show was great. When we meet Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters, he introduces Numa. Right away I remembered her as the girl that Waxer and Boil saved in season 1 of the Clone Wars and it just made me so happy. I also can't tell you how happy I was to see Rex and Ahsoka reunite. That was something I didn't know I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lore that the show dives into is also great. It explores parts of the force that had never been seen before, but unlike The Last Jedi, it does it in a way that's built up to and not just shoved in your face out of the blue. The world between worlds and connection to the Mortis Arc in the Clone Wars was so well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Kanan's death was easily the most heroic and emotion filled deaths I've ever seen. Allowing him to regain his sight at the last second so he could see the woman he loves and his friends one last time was absolutely heart wrenching. Thank you Dave Filoni for that amazing scene. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only major gripe is how incompetent the storm troopers are. They would miss nearly every shot and only land one if the plot required it. There were very few, if any cases throughout the show of any of the main characters actually getting hit. It made you feel as if they were in no danger at all unless inquisitors or someone else was there. It also made the attempts at large battles a bit underwhelming. The first one that comes to mind is Season 4 episode 14 \"A Fools Hope\". Near the end of the episode, the rebels are grouped up on a tiny platform with 7 or 8 of them behind two small boxes. They are surrounded on nearly all sides yet only one person gets hit and its only in the shoulder. I'm not saying that the scene and episode weren't entertaining, I'm just saying that there wasn't a real sense of danger. \n",

I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected to, it had its flaws but I would still recommend it to any Star Wars fan\n",

      "So I’ve recently been trying to watch Resistance and there’s a few questions that have come up as I’m trying to get through it. So I always assumed that the First Order was created by ex-imperials but one thing that boggles my mind is why do they seem so well funded compared to the Resistance. We know that the current galactic government is the New Republic to replace the old Empire. That being said, I would imagine most member worlds of the Republic and later Empire would be part of it. Hence they should have the majority of the same resources as the Republic or Empire. But in the sequels we see them using the same ships that were being used 30 years prior, something we didn’t see as the Republic transitioned to the Empire. The Empire got all new stuff really quick. Instead it’s the First Order that’s loaded enough to have larger fleets and build Starkiller Base. The other thing that doesn’t make sense is why is the Resistance called that? Isn’t the Resistance technically the army of the New Republic? Why do they look as ragtag as the Rebellion did?\n",

Chancellor Valorum is the one who sent Sifo-Dyas to Oba Diah, and the file on the matter was sealed, possibly by Valorum, but most likely by Palpatine/Sidious after he became Chancellor to avoid any questions. The point is, Valorum's role indicated that everything happened before The Phantom Menace, therefore before Maul had been killed.* \n",

Maul being the more appropriate Sith Apprentice and Dooku being used (the pawn as he's referred to in the Darth Vader comics) because of his ability to assist in the creation of the Clone Wars. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 2:** Sifo-Dyas's death most likely happened *days* within the Invasion of Naboo and Sidious/Palpatine had moved quick and already named Dooku as a new apprentice. The ordering of Sifo-Dyas's death must have been one of his first orders as a Sith. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 3:** Maul was Sidious's true apprentice, but Dooku was around serving as a \"sith agent\" as opposed to being an apprentice - kind of like the Inquisitorius, Ventress being a sith assassin, etc. Sidious was keeping Dooku in reserve just in case something would happen with Maul - which it did. \\*\\*The Pykes, in S6:Ep10, refer to Dooku as Tyranus, ***NOT*** Darth Tyranus, so this could indicate that he wasn't a Sith apprentice yet, he wasn't a Darth.\\*\\* So Dooku was affiliated with Sidious, but not named his apprentice yet.\n",

      "It would be kind of fulfilling to have Maul say, at some point during one of the last three episodes of Season 7, \"you replaced me! while I was still alive!\" acknowledging the fact that Sidious had already moved on to replacing him while Maul was still around. But I feel like he would have already done this, in the Son of Dathomir comic or something before now. but you know, retcons happen!\n",

My idea for making him canon again is making him one of the first Inquisitors as well as Vader's secret apprentice.

It showed how you could humanize a character without removing a character's mystique. We get the classic origin story \"fill in the blanks\" style storytelling, but it's done naturally.

There's nothing more mythic than the story of a hero who is initially burdened by his own legend and what it represents, a hero who comes to terms with that legend, and then finally transcends it. Luke's final scene in TLJ is one of my all time favorites. The man who uses his personal myth to inspire the rest of the galaxy, one last time. Post ROTJ Luke in Legends initially seemed like a very human figure, heroic and flawed. However, he started to feel like a RPG character after a while. Guy just got more and more OP, but grew more and more distant as a character. Any attempts at real character development (which did happen often) seemed to be temporary. There's some beautiful Luke material post ROTJ, especially in the bantam era and NJO, but I'd argue that the Luke we finally say farewell to in Crucible is the exact same individual we left in ROTJ.\n",

I think it’s fair to say Yoda is the reason I like Star Wars now. I’m ultimately glad I decided to catch up and I’m excited to watch the modern films. I’m starting to get the hype a little bit. I realize I’m more than a decade behind but I’m just stoked to be catching up now.\n",

I click on the video and at first I was all excited but then I realized some of the footage was already used. But I didn’t mind since I thought it was a teaser so many we’ll just get one new shot from season 2. Eventually, it of course ends up being fake with Baby Yoda now being a teenager and smoking yellow sticks?! What the actual hell IGN?!

It feels like they did him poorly, lessened what he could have been. Honestly that recent TCW episode was the only time I felt intimidated by that version of him.

Two, I love Ian Ian McDiarmid as him and I don’t think you can properly wrap up the Skywalker saga without Palpatine. And George Lucas is the one who suggested to bring back Palpatine in the EU in the first place so it’s not like he hates the idea or anything. Perhaps the biggest is that it’s very strange to have six movies in your saga with him as the overall head villain and then for the next three have someone else. I don’t know it just seems so displaced from the other six in my opinion, and wouldn’t feel right considering had SUCH a big part in the previous six episodes. \n",

It’s obviously not planned, and they offer basically no explanation as to how he’s here now, and on top of that he doesn’t even have that much time in the movie. And the way he gets defeated is so anti climactic. He could have worked if maybe Anakin was in the movie(he should have been there anyway), and maybe he somehow lead to Palpatine getting defeated again. I know it’s a stretch but I’m sure an actual writer could come up with something that’d work. It’d also work much better if he was revealed to have orchestrated everything at the end of episode 8, could have been a very cool twist in my opinion. \n",

      "\n",
      "Same could be done with Ahsoka. There are myriad reasons we may not have seen her during the OT and sequel trilogies. Did she distract the rest of the bounty hunters in ESB so our heroes only had to deal with Fett? Perhaps she assisted the Bothan spies in stealing the plans for the second Death Star. Why didn't we see more of the Knights of Ren? Was Ahsoka responsible, keeping them occupied and at bay so they couldn't come at Rey and Co? Did she Obi Wan in his adventures, or have him help her on a mission or two...?\n",

      "TRoS is a controversial film that has drawn a lot of criticism from the Star Wars fanbase. While I personally enjoyed the film, I'm not making this post to defend it in it's entirety. Rather, there is one criticism that is often repeated, which I intend to refute:\n",

      "**Palpatine being alive cheapens, lessens, or entirely negates Anakin sacrificing himself to destroy him.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Though, admittedly, the film makes no effort to support these arguments explicitly, there are two reasons why that criticism is inaccurate, and why Palplatine being alive has either a neutral or positive effect on Anakin's sacrifice:\n",

This has upset people, as they see it weakening the point of his sacrifice. But why does it matter if Palpatine is permanently dead? Why is Anakin's great act of redemption contingent upon killing the Emperor? Remember, Vader wanted to kill him as far back as ESB. In true Sith fashion, he wanted to kill his master and turn Luke to the dark side as his new apprentice. Look at it like this:\n",
      "\n",

      "In both scenarios, he kills Palpatine, but what changes is the *why.* Rather than killing him to overthrow him and take his place, he kills him to save his son at the cost of his own life. It's the *why* that shows Anakin's redemption. The Jedi returned, he sacrificed his own life to save the life of an innocent. If he was motivated by the goal of *killing* Palpatine, there is no growth or redemption. If he was motivated by *stopping* Palpatine from torturing and killing his son, and motivated so much so that his own life is willingly given in the process, then there is growth and redemption. He redeemed himself by acting like a Jedi, not a Sith\n",

      "This is a shorter point, and it's simply that the whole \"chosen one, bring balance to the Force, etc.\" prophecy was always bullshit. \"A prophecy misread could have been\" or whatever Yoda said sums it up. There are so many ways to interpret it that it's essentially meaningless. The Jedi held onto it as an idea to feel like they still knew what was going to happen, to still feel like they understood the Force. But the whole point of the prequels was that the Jedi were so up their asses that they didn't notice their elected leader was a fucking Sith lord. Their powers had weakened. They were so obsessed with their own dogma that they never even questioned Anakin being immaculately conceived. A Sith Lord created a perfect dark apprentice literally out of thin air, and the Jedi are just like \"chosen one, bring balance to the Force.\" Yeah, they don't want to train him at first, but because of their age restrictions, not because of common sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "All this is to say that the Jedi reliance on a vague and meaningless prophecy was bullshit and expecting Anakin to literally bring balance to the Force (whatever that means) detracts from the actual human element of his sacrifice.\n",

      "During the quarantine, I've been showing my fiance a lot of movies I enjoy. We watched most of the Marvel movies over the last three weeks and now we are doing Star Wars. After watching The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones all the way through for the first time in a few years... woof. Those two are just... okay. I don't hate them, but I didn't love it. Revenge of the Sith is so good even in comparison to the rest of the Star Wars movies, but the first two in the prequels just aren't that good. Half the time, I had to explain to my fiance the importance of the politics in the movies. Being a Star Wars fan for most of my life, I know what's going on and have done so much research and watched a million youtube videos about Star Wars, so for me it all made sense. But for her, as someone who has only seen the sequels, the politics and back story of what is going on was not clear to her. I think back as a kid I really had no idea either, I just enjoyed the spectacle of all the effects and action. \n",
      "\n",
      "All that being said, I have gained a new respect for the sequels. While I was able to enjoy The Rise of Skywalker, even after a few viewings, I found it hard to enjoy The Phantom Menace, aside from the Pod Racing and the Maul duel. Same applies for Attack of the Clones, easier to watch than TPM, but still just tough at times. My fiance has seen the sequels, but she wanted to watch the other 6 because she wanted to see them all. She commented to me that no one should ever say the sequels are bad after watching the gungan army versus the droid army in TPM. I couldn't disagree with her. I love the prequels and love that era, but the movies are a tough watch if you're not a fully invested fan. The only movie she said she enjoyed from the prequels was Revenge of the Sith, which is totally fair. The re watch has just shown me that maybe we should give Disney more credit than we do. Though there are major gripes with the sequels, they're at least pretty good movies. Overall, I'd say the sequels are better, but of all the 6 prequel/sequel movies, Revenge of the Sith is the superior movie. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for being so long winded, but after my first re watch in a few years of the Prequels, I had to let my pride go and recognize that Disney is on the right path, it might have just taken a few sputters to get in the right direction.\n",

      "If you remember the Mortis arc in TCW season 3, the Father represented the force, the Daughter represented the light side and the Son represented the dark side. The father brought the chosen one (Anakin) to bring balance because the son was getting too powerful and planned to leave Mortis. While they were there, all three Mortis gods died. First the daughter, then the son and finally the father. When Anakin left, the force was balanced because all three Mortis force-gods were dead and none of them could grow too powerful and leave Mortis to wreak havoc on the rest of the galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Anakin was the chosen one after all even though Palpy apparently survived RotJ, because the prophecy was never ABOUT destroying the Sith. The Jedi in all of their ignorance twisted it to be about that. In reality, according to my friend who came up with this, the prophecy was ACTUALLY about destroying the Mortis gods and preventing them from escaping the way the Son was trying to do.\n",

I like how she puts together the whole training of the clone commandos by the Mandalorian comrades of Jango Fett.  The way the commandos interact with one another and their language interplay is amazing.  I, also, like how the Arc Troopers are from Kal Skirata's parentage.  You can see so many differences in each of the clones and how they adapt their Mando trained culture into everyday life.  \n",

Accompanied with extreme stress and emotional inarticulation, (which are both induced by his Jedi training,ironically enough) it may lead to complete conscious dissociation.  \n",
      "2 things lead me to this hypothesis : clues in the story and the way Vader's personality mirrors Anakin's.  \n",
      "My clues are in Rebels,during his encounter/fight with Ahsoka and in Return of the Jedi,when Luke verbally confronts Vader.  \n",
      "In Rebels, when Ahsoka appears before him, he doesn't talk to her as if he ever knew her,rather as if he knows of her from somebody else's memories. He also constantly refers to Anakin as another person and claimed that he destroyed him since he was weak.  \n",
      "But the most direct clue,to me, is right after Vader took Ahsoka's blow to his mask.  \n",
      "Not only does he call her by her first name, but responds (physically at least) to being called Anakin. He then looks down in shame,and then Vader takes over.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In ROTJ, not only can Luke sense the conflict inside of his father,but the audience also can. I think this whole scene is Anakin being himself.He reacts to his on name in almost a childish way,very much like he could have done in AOTC. \"You don't know the power of the Dark Side\" is a warning. Not only does it sound like one,but it's also indicated by the context. The way he handles Luke's lightsaber and comments on it is a sign of how proud of his son he is and obviously,the line \"it is too late for me,son\" speaks for itself.We can also argue that \"Son\" used this way sounds rather affectionate,especially coming from the OG \"not the men,but the women and children too\" youngling killer . And only on Luke's second discussion with him,mind you.  \n",

He's responsible for the destruction of the Republic, lost all of his friends, got heavily mutilated by his former mentor,ended up being pretty much Palpatine's slave, and he didn't even reach the goal he was trying to attain by doing all of that : Saving Padme. All he has is his anger,his hate,and the Dark Side.  \n",
      "Where Anakin was emotionally eruptive, Vader is composed.  \n",
      "Where Anakin was sometimes impulsive and spontaneous, Vader is incredibly calculating.  \n",
      "Where Anakin lacked repartee, Vader is, like, the sassiest guy in the galaxy,just look at his punchlines.  \n",

      "As we all know, despite the disappointment of the sequel trilogy and the mediocrity of the prequels, the star wars universe has still captured our imaginations. So I pose a question. Why do you, people of reddit, think the original trilogy succeeded while the other trilogies did not? By success, I am referring to rating, fan love, or the general opinion of the trilogy. NOT the profit. The original trilogy is seen as this amazing story that is highly rated and it popularized the name \"star wars\" while the other 2 trilogies are seen as not even half of what the original was. So why do you think it succeeded? because of George Lucas, the time period, the story, etc. I personally believed the original trilogy succeeded because George Lucas wrote it as one movie instead of 3 (then he changed it to 3 because it was way too damn long), as said in the documentary \"Empire of dreams.\" I am excited to hear what everybody else has to say as to why the original is so much better than the rest. (NOTE: we are not here to debate why a certain trilogy sucks or not. I don't want the comments of this post to be a long, drawn-out debate. Just why the trilogy succeeded or why do you believe it didn't sit well in the eyes of the fan base).\n",

      "4. Continuing off of point 2, you give a lot of weight to the abducted children issue.  Cause right now, it's like... no empathy for killing millions of abducted children.  So keeping Hux as a conduit for redeeming a lot of these kids seems to me like a lot more meaningful then simply killing them all.  I mean, the trilogy kept trying to push the theme of \"awakening\" and how Lando's hypothetical children can turn back from being brainwashed.  So it's actually very uncomfortable to think that none of those million of other kids are redeemable, what if a lot more of them can wake up too?\n",

I kinda feel there's still ways to execute it so that even if that's really what's going on in the background, cinematically, you still give more weight to rebels with more screen time, like the movie in its current state now.

(Nothing like the originals of course.) 7 is great, 8 is probably the most okay you can get, and I really loved 9. I also think it's much easier to be a Star Wars fan now with all the games, shows, and even spin off movies.

      "I’ve always been under the impression that ROTS takes place over the course of at least 4 months. When Palme tells Anakin she is pregnant, there is hardly a bump. Throughout the movie, she gradually gets larger and larger. Anakin’s turn obviously truly started with the death of his mother, and then rapidly progressed from the start of ROTS, with the premonitions of Padme’s death. Everything that happens after that just catalyzes his turn. It seems unlikely that he totally turns over the course of just a couple days or even hours. It’s hard to tell that the movie takes place over that span of several months though, because you’re constantly jumping between planets, all at different times of day &amp; night. I feel the same about Ep.II. I think Anakin and Padme has several weeks to a month to fall in love on Naboo. He obv. felt strongly about her since Ep. I, but she must’ve take at LEAST a few months to develop a serious love for him.\n",

It could bring back characters from all across the Star Wars time and space as well as actors to voice them. Thoughts?\n",

The Jedi order has been dead for over half a century and the only formally trained character, kylo Ren/Ben solo, stopped his training as a Padawan. And Rey's use of a lightsaber \"like a baseball bat\" makes sense because the only meme weapon she has used was her staff.

      "The light side wins in every movie. Right there off the bat you’re fundamentally misunderstanding the franchise. In the first 6 movies the light side wins on some occasions and the darkside wins on other. That’s what makes both of those wins meaningful. If one wins every time it’s meaningless just like it is in the sequels. There are no stakes. You never buy the first order are actually a big deal, no matter how much you fabricate it you cannot earn evil greatness without them actually succeeding on occasion. Kylo Ren had so much potential, Adam driver an amazing actor did SO MUCH with what he was given but he can only do so much to be a supervillain, the script has to support him. Rey BEATING HIM in the forest when he’s basically fully trained and she’s NOT EVEN TRAINED AT ALL, NOT TRAINED, NOT TRAINED. This is one of the biggest insults in the entire franchise because you play up a character with smoke and mirrors (make him look and sound like a badass powerful villain) but then completely destroy that character when it’s time for actions. He loses when she’s untrained but then is better than her in rise of the skywalker when she is. The sequels would have made much more sense if he beats her in the forest, the badass moment of him killing Han Solo isn’t taken away, HE WINS at the end of the force awakens. Then she goes training. And THEN her win would have been so much sweeter.\n",

      "First of all, I loved the force unleashed games, I played both of them a lot and was a big fan of how quite frankly badass they made you feel. That being said, looking back, I can't help but look back and think that starkiller is a lot less interesting of a character than the fandom makes him out to be. The only things about him that I can see as interesting are 1) his level of power and the feats this enables him to achieve (yes him bringing down a star destroyer has become a meme at this point!) and 2) the conflict of his character.\n",
      "\n",
      "With point one, I really don't know how you'd implement him back into canon in a way that is justified within the story it's being told in. I've heard the suggestion of making him an inquisitor, however we know in canon that they are trained in a way so that their levels of power are limited, to keep them in check with Vader, so this wouldn't hold up. Furthermore, the reason this power is interesting in TFU is because you get to control it, sure watching it on screen would be cool, but it wouldn't come with any sort of depth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now onto my second point, I don't think Starkiller is a completely disinteresting character, but at the very least, all the ways in which his character are interesting have already been done in canon, and a lot better than that. Examples of this would be Kylo Ren and his struggle with the light and dark that was portrayed beautifully by Adam Driver. My point being that I think he'd end up feeling like an amalgamation of other canon characters.\n",

Up until TRoS, it has been generally understood that this is Palpatine's attempt to sway Luke to the dark side.

New canon material (TRoS Expanded Edition) establishes that, when Vader threw him over the ledge, he used the same knowledge he attempts to use on Rey in TRoS to transfer his spirit from his falling body to a clone of himself on Exegol. This information tell us that he already had the knowledge to take over Luke's body by the time of Episode VI, and given the age of his current body, he definitely had the same intention to take over the body of someone far younger and more powerful. It fails on Luke, and fails again on Rey - a symbolic symmetry that JJ was clearly aiming to achieve.\n",

This resistance is exactly the principle that Yoda teaches him the movie before, where Luke learns that \"Jedi use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Palpatine knows this and tells Luke to kill him. In the pre-TRoS universe, he's not doing this because he's suicidal. He's doing this because he knows that anyone who sees the Emperor would be vulnerable to falling to their own hatred, and in that vulnerability rises weakness. Palpatine knows that hatred is the ultimate counter to the Jedi principles Yoda must have taught him, so he exploits Luke's natural hatred towards him by taunting and goading him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk in this scene, therefore, is symbolic. If Luke kills the Emperor, he is no better than the Sith. Killing Sidious right there would end the war, but the method clashes with the ideals of both the Rebel alliance and the fallen Jedi Order they revere. Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor - embodied by the quote \"I am a Jedi, like my father before me\" - is **monumental because most people, including us in the audience, would have abandoned their morals and principles to get that cheap kill.** And that's why Luke is a Jedi, while most people aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come TRoS, and now we know that the risk Luke is facing is no longer symbolic and of character, but rather an existential risk. If Luke kills the Emperor, he would literally die and have his corpse taken over by the Emperor. Existential risks can make for good storytelling too, but in this case it seriously degrades the significance of the original scene. Now Luke's decision to not kill the Emperor is one motivated by pure survival instincts - not by a delicate adherence to Jedi principles. Tell Han Solo that blasting the Emperor would mean he dies and OF COURSE Han would put his blaster away. Luke's decision is no longer a show of unique character, but rather a decision that even you and I, as non-Jedi, would've made in that situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why the Emperor laughs when Luke finally does strike and is blocked by Vader. It means his goal of instilling hatred in Luke is succeeding. Given TRoS, Palpatine should've yelled \"Vader you ruined my plan of spirit transfer!\" instead of laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only solution I see to this thematic retcon is that Luke, while making his decision in Episode VI, isn't aware of the Emperor's spirit transfer and is thus still making his choice based on character rather than survival instinct. While this reduces the damage to the uniqueness of his character, it still damages the scene because strips it of some of the stakes. We as the audience now understand that there is no reward for killing the Emperor. Until Vader betrayed him, the Emperor would have won if Luke attacked and still would have won if Luke spared him. It's a lose-lose situation either way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luke's decision in the pre-retcon version of the scene was significant because he was presented with a win-lose situation, where killing the Emperor would have meant a quick victory for the rebels, and yet still chose the losing outcome that came at a cost to his own safety at the hands of the Emperor's lightning.\n",

I can sit back and enjoy the sequel trilogy now and see them as entertaining movies with great visual effects and some nice characters (I actually like Rey's personality).

One for each movie of course. The set up is as follows, After the death of Emperor Palpatine, Imperial figures fight over the rightful \"throne\" to the empire, creating an internal war inside the empire. Soon, the empire breaks off into hundreds of Imperial factions with different leaders. The Jedi suffer a similar fate, as luke skywalker and several other Jedi decide to abandon the ways of \"Jedi\" and \"Sith\" and create a community where people are allowed to interpret the force in their own ways. Soon conflict breaks out between the remaining pure Jedi, and the free-thinking Jedi. Kylo Ren, a leader of an Imperial Faction, creates a political movement calling for the reforming of the imperial government, more specifically calling for the factions to come together to form the empire that once was. His belief is that since economic resources are spread so thin across the factions, there will be no way to defeat the Jedi. Unless they all come together. Kylos movement gains a following, and soon the empire comes together at last with a stronger desire to take down the Jedi than ever before under their new Extremist Leader, Kylo Ren. Now, Luke Skywalker and his group of free-thinking Jedi have to come to terms with the pure Jedi to stop the empire once again.\n",

I felt rewarded for my love, for my knowledge. I was part of an exclusive club because I was with those who loved Star Wars like me. And as the episode ended amd the credits rolled I came crashing to earth at the destruction and lack of creativity or care take with this amazing franchise. That I was no longer Disney's target audience for Star Wars and that I no longer belonged here... It hurt me...\n",

      "So, sadly, I think I will enjoy the last episode of Clone Wars as it is the last time part of this cash cow that was meant for me. I will keep my old EU books, and I will play my old BF2 to remember a lost age. I may even watch the six movies again sometime. But this is my end of me supporting new Star Wars. It has been a wild ride and I hate for it to come to an end, but all good things come to an end. Until next time, may the Force be with you.\n",

      "I just watched it for the first time and actually really really enjoyed it. I thought it certainly contained a lot of Star Wars cliches and such but the emotional heart of the film was intelligent and the dialogue was very well written. I also thought there was a lot more meta fiction in the film— more subtext, symbolism, more overall artistry that isn’t necessarily a staple of the previous star wars films. I enjoyed this change of pace and thought it freshened up a film I had avoided watching for months (out of the fear that it would ruin my childhood). I certainly think it undid the mess that the prior film made as I thought that one was nothing short of disastrous outside of a few scenes. Why did it get so much hate? I’d love to hear everyone’s opinions on it.\n",

      "Imagine if Disney made a whole season after season 7, not a continuation of the show but a season of the lost battles we never got to see in action that was teased in the movie ROTS. So for example, 3 or 4 episodes of kashyyyk with the clones defending the planet with the Wookiee’s against the droids before Yoda arrived, him arriving would be the last episode of that battle ark and that moment in ROTS would tie in. Other battles I’d love to see would be Commander Bly and 327 battle on Felucia at any  point in the later part of the war (With Sicura dying tying into ROTS would be cool) Plo Koons last battle with the Wolfpack before his death would be sick, the battle of Mygeeto with Ki Adi Mundi and the galactic marines would be awesome and lastly the ground battle of Coruscaunt as we only saw the space battle. Would be cool if we saw every battle in the span of 3-4 episodes each. What do you guys think?\n",

A few months ago, I found an interesting looking VHS of Return of the Jedi at a Good Will a few towns over. I didn't recognize the box. I looked at the copyright date and it was before the release of the special editions. I bought it and have been to afraid to watch it. It was kind of like Schrödinger's VHS: If I don't watch it, it simultainiously is and isn't the special editions.

Luke said that Ben had vanished with a handful of his students and slaughtered the rest. We see a shot of the temple burning and like 5 or 6 bodies in front of R2 and luke. My question is how is this possible? In the kylo ren comic it’s shown that the temple exploded from the storm clouds above and Ben said he never wanted any of this. So how is it possible there were all those dead students in front of Luke if Ben did not kill them. I checked the scene again and the bodies were not burnt so they obviously did not die from the fire or the explosion. They were obviously killed by a person. Did Ben actually kill all those students and we just didn’t see it? Can you guys help me figure out this lore discrepancy? I’m having a hard time envisioning what actually happened on that night at the temple and to those students. Is it a retcon or is there an in-universe lore explanation? Thanks for the help everyone.

Which is why I will always like seeing characters like Ahsoka on screen because it really disproves the idea that you need to have a human character as a main protagonist to relate to audiences. Right now for the most part alien protagonists in Star Wars don't get a lot of screen time and are usually reduced to being a sidekick and comedic relief or a background character. So whenever we get a character like Ahsoka or somebody like Hera on screen I will always appreciate seeing it.\n",

We know from Rebels that the Son, Daughter, and Father were known to a few via art and history.

The way he talks to Ahsoka in the last episode, the way him and obi-wan interact make them seem like brothers, the way Rex is his best friend, and the way he hates the separatists.

This was the last time that Anakin and Ahsoka would see each other before Anakin turns to the dark side. It was a touching moment, and I did enjoy it. But, there’s a part of me that didn’t. Let me explain. When we see them meet in Rebels, Ahsoka says “I won’t leave you, not this time”. This line hits hard because the last time they saw one another she was walking away from the Jedi temple leaving him there alone. This was a huge moment and I feel like their interaction in this new episode takes away from that. They part on good terms here with him giving back her lightsabers and wishing one another good luck. It was a great moment, but in the grand scheme of things a part of me wishes they never met face to face. Now you can argue and say that her line in Rebels was calling back to her choice to go to Mandalore while he went to save the Chancellor on Coruscant. But even still, it wouldn’t have the same impact as when she left the Jedi.\n",

But in the case of a Old Republic movie trilogy, I think they should do a film with Tarre Vizsla and him during the Mandalorian Wars, I think it would make one interesting film with him struggling to choose sides with the Jedi Order or the Mandalorians. Maybe see his perspective on the Mandalorian wars and him trying to choose a side between the Jedi Order or his people. Maybe we could see him creating the Darksaber, and I think with the right writer and director, it could work. \n",

This season at start was very slow and very not interesting with the first few Ahsoka episode’s with trace and Rafa and then the Bad bad batch arc was not bad but could’ve been worse but then Oh My God! So firstly Anakin being Anakin as he is being unpredictable with his plans with Obi Wan watching him in the background like a concerned father figure, surprising the separatists with a surprise attack. Then soon after Ahsoka comes back with information about Maul being on Mandalore, that’s when Star Wars Episode III starts with the chancellor being kidnapped by Greivous and Count Dooku making Obi Wan and Anakin being unable to join Ahsoka in the assault but not with out Anakin wishing her luck and gives her her old lightsabers that also have a blue color making me want to kill Anakin for changing the colors 😡😡😡. So with a combined attack with the 501st and the Mandolorian’s they go around to try and take control of the city while also find Maul and capture him. Then Ahsoka meets Maul as he comes out seeing it’s not Obi Wan but Ahsoka. With the amazing and talented Sam Witwer playing Darth Maul just made me jump out me seat making me a giddy little kid. Over all this by far has been the best episodes of the series and out of the season. I just can’t wait to see what the other next episodes have in store for us.\n",

      "Think about it. Anakin's lightsaber was destroyed in TLJ. Without a lightsaber, Rey cannot fight Kylo or even hope to confront Palpatine. With time fast running out, she searches through Luke's old books and discovers the location of a hidden cave filled with kyber crystals, miraculously undiscovered and untouched by the old Empire. From there, she undertakes the monumental task of building a lightsaber without the guidance of a master and only old texts for consultation. We see her use her ingenuity and craftiness as a scavenger to fashion a hilt from spare parts and scrap metal, which she imbues with the power of a never-before-seen-in-movie-form *yellow* kyber crystal. She then salvages as many kyber crystals as she can find, as these will be the foundation for training the next generation of Jedi, before leaving the cave and returning to the Resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right off the bat, this would have been much more compelling than searching for some dumb Sith dagger. In essence, the Sith dagger was nothing more than the search for a map that led to another map that led to a planet. Literally just a MacGuffin for the sake of padding the movie's runtime. However, reframing the journey as a search for a new kyber crystal makes the first act of TROS *so* much more meaningful to the story, because now Rey actually has a personal stake in this search. Without a lightsaber, she simply won't be able to hold her own against Kylo and the First Order. She *cannot* fail here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, calling back to The Old Republic, a Jedi constructing their first lightsaber is a very important milestone and a truly special spiritual experience. This could have been Rey decisively taking her first step into becoming a knight of the Jedi Order. Not only would this have been the first cinematic debut for a yellow lightsaber, but this would have been Star Wars' first cinematic depiction of the construction of a lightsaber. Imagine seeing Rey get frustrated with the complexity of such an alien task, and then finally sitting down and clearing her mind through the Force, allowing the lightsaber to come together on its own. Wouldn't that have been fucking epic? The aesthetic here would play perfectly into Rey's character as well. She isn't simply a Jedi of old; she intends to forge her own path and rebuild the Jedi Order anew. What better way to showcase her idiosyncrasy than by giving her a unique lightsaber color? For that extra cherry on top, give her lightsaber a unique sound the same way they did with Kylo's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on. Giving Rey a new lightsaber would establish her character growth from the previous 2 movies, and oh would you look at that, it would have been a nice parallel to Episode 6 when Luke also had a new lightsaber! It would have also been a proverbial passing of the torch between the OT/PT and the ST &amp; beyond. As Anakin's lightsaber defined the old era of Star Wars, Rey's new lightsaber will be the symbol of Star Wars' future.\n",
      "\n",
      "If TROS chose to run with the yellow lightsaber from the beginning, I would have had a lot of respect for them sticking with an original idea for once instead of trying to ride the corpse of motifs and ideas from 40 years ago. I mean, this movie pretty much just repaired Anakin's lightsaber offscreen because it was so afraid of doing something innovative. I can't be the only one here who feels like is cowardly at best. They played it so safe that they ended up with an inferior product. All I can say is that it looks like bad business sense to me, and TROS' glut of pointless, empty goose chases that could have been much more meaningful is a microcosm of what I perceive to be Disney/LucasFilm's lack of vision with this franchise. Ultimately, I am just proposing a what-if scenario here, but my hope is that Disney learns the correct lessons moving forward to ensure that Episode 10 and beyond are the best that they can be.\n",

Anyone with a reasonable degree of common sense and situational awareness, something a bounty hunter should definitely have, would morph and slip out while Anakin and Obi-Wan were occupied. Instead, she decides, for some reason, to attempt to shoot Obi-Wan in the back at point blank range. Jedi are fairly distinct looking in comparison to any normal security force, so she definitely knew she was being chased by them, so walking very close to one of them is the worst possible decision she could have made. She's a hack, and handily the worse bounty hunter/contracted assassin we have seen in Star Wars. At least Greedo had believed he had the upper hand til the bitter end.\n",

They never allowed showing of emotions (which is mentally unhealthy) and they said \"the force works in mysterious ways\" when they realized Ahsoka was framed, even though that's their shit excuse to make up for their lacking perspectives.

As a fan of the 2003 Genndy Tartakovsky Clone Wars series, I enjoyed seeing the Battle of Coruscant as the series ended tying it to the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  In Legends, it is pretty epic, with Separatist ships crashing out of hyperspace into Republic ships as carriers land on the planet, but with Disney getting rid of a lot of that for their new canon, I kind of think this is one they needed to do, or at least show us the beginning.  This is one of the largest and final battles of the war, fought on the surface, the sky and in space, commanded by Count Dooku and all while General Grievous is on a mission to capture Chancellor Palpatine.

      "In the cartoon series “Star wars the Clone Wars”, S1 Ep2 the separatists have a ship called the Malevolent. The ship had an ion cannon which would disable ships electrical systems, making engines, shields, life support, and weapons systems not work. In the Revenge of the Sith, the opening scene is a battle over Coruscant. If the separatists sent A fleet in and then sent multiple ships with ion cannons, the ships with ion cannons could take out groups of Republic ships because they can’t fire back. Making it so the separatist could destroy the whole blockade more efficiently. That would then make way for a ground attack if they wanted. They would then have been able to take coruscant. This in turn would give them most all major hyperspace lanes lead that lead to Coruscant. They then would have most the senate, the chancellor, and all the war prisoners. It would be way a more efficient strategy, than what they did in the movie. They would be able to launch attacks anywhere in the Republic systems with ease.

Well R2-D2's name, the \"R2\" part is his model number, so there are probably hundreds, if not thousands of R2's.  It would be like calling your dog by it's breed...

      "I've recently been rewatching the Clone Wars series including the final season as the come out week by week, and I honestly feel like episode 3 would need to be remade. There's just too much of a lack of emotion in the characters towards so many things when you go back and rewatch the movie. There's no emotional ties to the clone army. The whole scene between Obi Wan and Grievous make it seem like it's their first time meeting when it's contradicted by the CW series. Anakin still lacks a depth of character to him, as do the others in some instances. They just don't feel like battle hardened Jedi/soldiers/whatever you would like to call them. It's just jarring to see the stark contrast between the two mediums. \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that the CW series came way after the movie to fill in the gaps between episodes 2 and 3, but in doing so it makes me want more out of RotS. I know with these last four episodes of the series it'll cross over into episode 3 so there will be some retconning/reimagining of some scenes from the movie, but I feel like that wouldn't be enough. Does anyone else feel this way? If this has been discussed on the sub before, I apologize. I tried to look for anything on this before posting, but I couldn't find anything.\n",

      "Now don’t get me wrong, I love Star Wars and so far have loved everything Disney has put out. This is not a new problem. This has been happening since Return of the Jedi, Star Wars has a habit of repeating itself. I believe this is from bizarre idea that repeating similar ideas makes it more Star Wars. But Star Wars was about crazy weird ideas that everyone thought wouldn’t work. George didn’t play it safe. He was crazy when making the original movie and the prequels. I feel like this gung ho disregard for authority and rules is missing lately.\n",

      "\n",
      "To me the Clones are the best part of the show because despite looking the same and having the same voice actor they seem like real people with very different traits and personalities. In contrast despite the droids being made more intelligent and vocal for the show they by design come of as still same same compared to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just re-watched the general Krell arc and to me this is the best arc of the show because it highlights the individuality of the clones, their ability to move past their programming and make real choices for real principles. Not to mention the tragedy of their eventual brainwashing and turning on their friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whats more this arc stirs in me a emotional response the likes of which the rest of the show cant evoke. When the clones are sent by krell to attack umbarrans posing as clones only to realize they have been killing each other this really hit home. I actually teared up alittle bit cause you felt the pain. There are episode from shows every now and then that just hit you. The Krell arc hits me with the same emotion i felt when watching (showing my age reference) the fresh prince of belaire which normally is a stupid campy show but the episode when Will accidentally gives carlton speed or the episode when wills dad comes back and the leaves again and uncle Phil hugs him at the end. Thats the same emotion I felt in this arc.\n",

Because i can never see the films again like I did the first time. Because even in the sequels, we never see Luke, Leia, and Han together again. Because these films CAN NEVER BE RECREATED. Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels a lot, but they weren't like the original trilogy.

I’m just tired of the identity politics agendas and themes, the bitter infighting amongst the fans, the subpar storytelling and creative decisions, and the general fact that Lucasfilm is completely out of touch with the fan base and shows no signs of changing. I’m probably withdrawing my membership in the 501st Legion and Rebel Legion as well. I’m just done with it all.

      "\n",
      "Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads to my current dilemma. I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am completely torn on this because she Loves it and I kind of like it but I am a big \"Risk mitigation\" kind of person that wholeheartedly believes in controlling the controllables and being happy with results after that and so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.\n",
      "Any help is appreciated.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think that at the end of Rise of Skywalker both Rey and Ben were Jedi. If you think back to episode 8 ben had Jedi training. He was used and twisted by the dark used just like anakin was. Which leads me to one of my biggest complaints about Rise of Skywalker. Ben died. I understand the poetic justice of it but at the end of the day it the movie would’ve been better if he hadn’t died. Think about it. In every trilogy there was one main romantic duo. In the prequels it was anakin and padme, in the original trilogy it was luke I mean Han and Leia. The fact that it was 3 movies in the making for that to finally happen, all that anticipation, just to be let down like that. And I know some people didn’t want them to kiss but like I said every trilogy had a couple. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine all the theories we could’ve formulated if he hadn’t died.Assuming he didn’t die, Rey and ben *kiss* they leave exegol with the resistance and they go to the base to say their goodbyes to their friends. They then leave and head for Luke’s island.  Or some other isolated location. The war is over and just like Han and Leia they settle down and start a family. Just like the Skywalker way they have twins. A boy and a girl. Rey and Ben along with the help of force Jedi before them start the new jedi order. Years go by and new force sensitive people appear all across the galaxy to be trained into Jedi. (Alternate theory with the war over and the force finally balanced there is no more conflict. Rey and ben have kids and die of old age happily married.)  Somehow, someway, palpa- kidding lol. Some new threat that I couldn’t care less about naming or giving a backstory to finds a planet with sith holocrons on it and learns the ways of the darkside. Then said sith vows to destroy the Jedi for some backstory reason. Oh and Ashoka could be in it. There’s been other theories by people that have said Ashoka is alive and she just went into hiding. I’m pretty sure her race can live that long. Ta dah new trilogy. But don’t let Disney make it let Lucas or someone else who knows how to make a Star Wars movie.\n",

      "Just finished the movie (very late to the game, I know) and if anyone could answer/expand on these questions, I'd be grateful. I have a million thoughts going through my head right now, so sorry if something here was actually explained in the movie and I missed it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, here it goes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What's up with the Palpatine cult on Exegol? Why is there a planet full of people stanning Sheev's wrinkly ass? What do they get out of giving him life support and building his crazy fleet for decades? Where did these guys even come from??\n",
      "2. That brings me to the fleet. How did Palpatine have the cash and tech to build a fleet so advanced it has death star lasers on every ship? Even at the height of his power, with all the tech and money at his disposal, the best he could do was the death star and then death star 2.0. Are the Palpatine cultists secretly genius engineers rolling in cash? Does exegol just happen to have all the materials needed to build a fleet of that size? My best guess is this was a long work in progress from maybe even before he became emperor, but that's still a stretch and it doesn't explain why he didn't use exegol and his possibly genius cult until after he hit the sack.\n",
      "3. Why would palpatine go to all this trouble to build a massive fleet in secret only to announce it to the whole galaxy? Wouldn't it be better to surprise attack the galaxy? I didn't really see any point of his whole broadcast, but Palpatine has always had a flair for the dramatic so I guess he wanted to take over in style.\n",
      "4. How is Rey related to Palpatine again? I wasn't 100% clear on that. I read that Rey's father was Palpatine's clone/son, but how would that make Rey so force-sensitive? I might be mistaken but I thought it was extremely hard to make force-sensitive clones, unless it was just some kind of coincidence that she happened to be so strong with the force.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess my questions are mostly about Palpatine. I was following along up until the Palpatine cult, but after that it's all complicated for me. Thanks!\n",

I know, I’m a disgrace, but I was hoping for someone to help me out on getting started! I’ve finally decided to start getting into the series (since I’m a huge sci-fi fan anyways) but I just have absolutely no idea where to begin. I don’t even know plots or premises! Someone want to help me out and let me know which movie to start with? Perhaps even give me a small synopsis of the world and storyline? No spoilers obviously, just want help getting started off!\n",

      "Do we have any answer as if the force is instantaneous or not? Because as far as we know there is actual science behind the force with midichlorians. So initially I’d guess the force is as fast as probably your neurons transmitting signals to each other which would be up to 268mph. However, as we’ve seen with the force dyad and even essence transfer, it seems that either the force is just instant or literally creates wormholes and goes through them to transmit signals in a seemingly instantaneous matter. Based on probability, Palpatines essence transfer traveled at least 10,000 light years away given that exogol is on the outer rim of the galaxy. Do you think that he instantly essence transferred to another body or that it took some time and he was traveling through space for a while. This is such a ridiculous question lmao but it’s how my brain works\n",

      "I assume Star Wars ships follow our real world rules, where the amount of fuel (Tibanna gas? Coaxium?) necessary to power a ship is directly proportional to the ship's mass. That being said, I think that once you get to ships that are a kilometer long and over, that fuel becomes a really big problem. A freighter like the Millennium Falcon might need only a few kilograms of fuel, but a Star Destroyer or even a Super Star Destroyer would need a ridiculously massive amount of fuel proportional to its mass. How the hell do they power those things? In order to run the *Executor* for a day, you would probably need to harness the entire power output of Planet Earth, and that probably wouldn't be enough to cover the hyperdrive and weapons systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets even hairier when we get into superweapon status, where not only does said vessel have to power itself, but it has to power a planet killing superlaser. It's established that the Death Stars utilize kyber crystals to enhance and focus energy, but in order to generate even a fraction of the power needed to vaporize a planet, they would need a reactor with a level of output that could rival a star. And what would power that reactor? No amount of coaxium or Tibanna gas would be physically or financially reasonable in this case. Starkiller Base is exempt here, as we know it draws its power from a nearby star. But what about the Xyston Class Star Destroyers from *The Rise of Skywalker*? Given that they have Death Star tech shrunk down into a cannon several hundred meters long, I imagine the weapon runs on some sort of exotic fuel, but where do they get this power from? Is there a special refueling station for planet killers? How do they generate this fuel? So many questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is a relatively mundane question in the Star Wars universe, but without fuel, ain't nobody going nowhere. And given the fact that the Star Wars 'verse has some of the biggest starships in all of science fiction, I think it is reasonable to speculate just how commonplace/accessible fuel is in Star Wars.\n",

      "Timothy Zahn wrote a short story in which Grand Admiral Thrawn completed a solo mission for Vader. I believe the Emperor was unaware of the mission. This story is not Canon now. However, I came away believing at the time that Vader and Thrawn met somewhat frequently in and around the Unknown Regions. I assert that the Emperor tasked Vader to report on the Imperial presence in the Unknown Regions. I thought that over time Vader and Thrawn developed a mutual respect for each other. I also believed they knew that the Empire would be better served with new leadership. I thought it would have been a great story. Vader and Thrawn preparing to destroy Palpatine and together rule their envisioned Empire. A plan evolving over some years. In secret, Vader would have had his arms,legs and organs regrown from cloning. I believe Sidious falsely claimed that Vader's shell of a body made it impossible to accept regrown organs and limbs. Sidious knew Vader,if whole, would become far more powerful than himself. In my mind, Vader had an apprentice in the Unknown Regions overseen by Thrawn. Vader and Thrawn knew the Rebels were an enormous threat. Both were against the creation of both Death Stars. And the Empire was streched too thin. The plans of the Lord and Admiral would restructure many things. \n",

      "You're hired to direct the second movie in the new Star Wars trilogy. You sit down to start the process of writing, well before TFA has finished post-production. You seperately have lunch with Lawrence Kasdan and coffee with J.J. Abrams. You even probably get to see a rough cut of the film. The first thing you realize is that the entire plot revolves around tracking down Luke Skywalker, who has disappeared onto an island for... some reason? J.J. and Larry don't really have any particular trajectory in mind so you're left to come up with a good reason why the heroic Jedi of the OT has exiled himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has to be a good reason why he would be here, despite the peril in the galaxy. You decide immediately that it can't be cowardice or selfishness. It has to be an active, positive reason. You are led to an interesting notion, one that might really provide a shake-up while preserving the characters integrity. Luke has come to the conclusion that the Jedi are fundamentally flawed, perpetuating a cycle of conflict, and that they need to go away so that the light will rise from another source to overcome the Dark Side. Luke genuinely believes he's doing the right thing for the galaxy and suddenly his exile becomes an act of self sacrifice; he is carrying the burden of knowing that his family and friends are fighting this war but he chooses not to engage with the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, that sounds interesting. So what story could you possibly come up with that would've led Luke to this kind of conclusion? There has to be a convincing reason why he thinks the Jedi need to end. There's obviously 30+ unseen years after ROTJ that you could explore, but you've got a lot of story to continue telling for all the new characters and you can't spend too much time exploring the past. Do you consider flashbacks? That's never really been done in Star Wars but it seems necessary. You decide to focus on one moment that will serve as both the catalyst for Ben Solo's still unexplained turn to the Dark Side, and a dramatic, personal failure on Luke's part. \n",
      "\n",
      "You conceptualize a scene where Luke discovers that Ben Solo has been manipulated and all but turned to the Dark Side. Just as in TESB, he sees a vision of future; of the death and the destruction of everything he loves at the hands of Kylo Ren. For \"the briefest moment of pure instinct\" he fearfully grabs his lightsaber, but immediately recoils in shock. With shame, he looks down to see the frightened face of his nephew, but before he can explain himself Ben attacks. He wakes to find his temple burning to the ground and all of his students slaughtered. The weight of an unimaginable guilt and sorrow comes crashing down as he looks on helplessly. It would be enough to break any man. This is all his fault. He has completely and utterly failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You now have a traumatic moment of heartbreak and misunderstanding that serves effectively to change Luke in profound way, but you know the story can't end there. This is a truly dark place for this character, but you now have to bring him back to a place of redemptive heroism. You decide on a scene where Yoda appears to Luke to have one last lesson. To show him that failure doesn't define him and that the galaxy does still need the Jedi. As you think about the climax of Luke's story arc you realize that you want him to face Kylo Ren, but Kylo can't die. And you don't want Kylo to kill Luke in battle, effectively repeating Han's death. You want Luke to die on his own terms, with peace and purpose. So you're led to the idea of a Force Projection. This would allow Luke to reunite with Leia and face Kylo, outsmarting him in the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "Add to that some moments of visual storytelling. At the beginning of the first act you have Luke throw away his Father's lightsaber. In the second act you have him refuse it again after revealing the truth of his worst failure. Then, at the climax of the story, you have Luke choosing to appear with that same saber, symbolising that he has finally accepted it from Rey. He has reclaimed his legacy, overcome his failure and returned as the hero that will single handedly save the Resistance and spark a \"new hope\" in the galaxy. In a moment a poetry and rhyming that would do George Lucas proud, he peacefully becomes one with the Force under the light of a binary sunset. His journey has come full circle.\n",

Essentially, the natural balance of the Force was broken after the Father, Son, and Daughter all died.

      "Between Episode 3 and 4:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Darth Vader (2017) (Comic)**: Tells the story of Vader starting the inquisitors, hunting Jedi, and getting his red Lightsaber. *Very* good comic series with Vader doing a lot of cool stuff while also expanding the lore in interesting and cool ways\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ahsoka (Book)**: Story about Ahsoka shortly after Order 66 as she has a run-in with the Inquisitors. Does a good job of explaining her mindset during that period and explains how she got her new lightsabers. A must-read for any Clone Wars/Rebels fans.\n",

It also has a really nice love story.\n",

It tells the story of Leia's time in the New Republic Senate and reveals what people thought when they found out she was Darth Vader's daughter. More importantly, it details the rise of the First Order and explains who they are and why they do what they do.\n",

      "- **Darth Vader (2020) (Comic)**: This has been great so far but it's only been 2 issues so I don't feel comfortable recommending it yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Rise of Kylor Ren (Comic)**: This series had some good moments, but it felt a little rushed. What we got was good, but I feel like it needed to be longer for me to feel comfortable recommending it. If you're interested in how Kylo fell to the Dark Side and met the Knights of Ren, this is the book for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Darth Vader: Lords of the Sith (Book)**: This was fun to listen to on audiobook...but that's because I could skip through the boring parts. It has a lot of really cool lore about the sith and Vader's feelings during the OT era, but I can't recommend it as a whole. If you're interested in Vader lore, I suggest checking it out.\n",

      "So with the Sequel Trilogy now all said and done (and the varying reactions that accompanied it), I guess people are now going to want to start thinking about doing entire Star Wars marathons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first choice would be just to do a straight run from Episode I-IV, but as anyone who's used the original Machete Order will attest this can be a lengthy process and doesn't tie the themes and story as nicely together as the MO does. \n",
      "\n",
      "So that got me thinking, now that the new trilogy is out, what about extending the MO to include the final three movies? I know that a lot of fans are unhappy with how they turned out, myself included, but perhaps a change of viewing order could help integrate them better into rest of the Star Wars saga. Hear me out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order would be like this, in keeping with the original MO of starting at a later episode and jumping back to get the backstory: \n",

      "- Episode VII - TFA\n",
      "- Episode VIII - TLJ\n",

      "- Episode VI - ROTJ\n",
      "- Episode IV - TROS\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "You start out with the New Republic, the First Order, Rey, Finn, Kylo, Maz, etc. and see that the Galaxy is in turmoil. Kylo, the grandson of the legendary Sith Lord Darth Vader, is on his destructive rampages, and to oppose him, Rey goes to study under the tutelage of the legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker, only to find out he's a disheveled old man with no interest in helping anyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just as he redeems himself at the end of TLJ, we jump back to see the origins of *his* story - how he joined the Rebellion, studied under Obi-Wan and Yoda, and found out the evil Darth Vader was none other than his father, Anakin Skywalker. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, we jump back *again*, to see Anakin's origin story, about how he was a promising young Jedi during the Clone Wars, how he fell in love with Padme, and wanted nothing more than to keep her alive and be faithful to the Jedi Order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we end up on a \"trilogy of finales\" - first we see Anakin succumb to the Dark Side out of fear of losing Padme, and he drags down the Republic, the Jedi Order and democracy with him, leading to the Empire and the rise of Palpatine. Then straight after, we see Luke, in his final confrontation with the Empire, both redeem his father and defeat Palpatine, leading to the birth of the New Republic and the resurrection of the Jedi Order. Then finally, at the end of everything, we see Rey learn of her heritage, Luke and Leia give Rey the final words of wisdom she needs to confront Kylo and Palpatine, Kylo ultimately turn away from evil and leave the Dark Side, and then Rey - and all the Jedi - take down Palpatine - and all the Sith - once and for all. She ends up burying Anakin's lightsabre on Tatooine, where both Anakin and Luke were from, receiving the approving looks of Luke and Leia, before reclaiming the Skywalker legacy and looking into the sunset. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this order Episode I is again unnecessary, since it doesn't really add crucial information about anything other than a couple of throwaway lines in Episode II. Also, this way the story is presented as the Rise, Fall, Resurrection and final defeat of the Dark Side of in the galaxy, as well as being the ultimate destruction of Palpatine and his menace. \n",
      "\n",
      "What do you guys think? I'm tempted to get Disney+ just to view all of this at once and see how it goes. I still have my issues with the movies but I think this could make them a lot more compelling to watch. Thoughts?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Personally, Kylo Ren was probably my favorite character we got from this Sequel Trilogy (or at least the first two films). That said, I always felt like there was so much more to his backstory. I understand that it has been recently explored in the comics, but I feel like it's also worthy tale to have told on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine this: what if *The Force Awakens* started a little earlier? Maybe one storyline in the film could've been Luke's training with Ben. Throughout the movie, we could slowly see he and Luke beginning to drift apart, and Ben's fascination with the Dark Side increasing. The film could've ended with him abandoning the Jedi code, embracing the darkness, and becoming Kylo Ren. That would've been some amazing character development to see not only for Ben, but for Luke, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the Sequel Trilogy is done and it's probably best to move on. But I can't help but wonder what could've been. Regardless, what are your thoughts on this? I'd love to hear what you all have to say.\n",

      "I tried googling but most results came up talking about prequels or OT. Or just from episode 9. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure it's been discussed, if anyone knows a good link to read that'd be helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Current things I'm unclear about are \n",
      "\n",
      "1) What was his plan in episode 6, because apparently he transferred his consciousness (or cloned I assume since he was still conscious in his last scenes) before the last fight. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) What is his ultimate plan in episodes 7-9. Is he hoping Snoke dies at the hands of rey/kylo? \n",
      "\n",
      "3) He tells kylo to kill rey at the beginning of episode 9. What happens if he succeeds, does he then possess Kylo somehow? \n",
      "\n",
      "4) If his final plan involved Rey, he was then somehow hoping that his clone son makes a son/daughter as well? All in the hopes that he can possess him/her?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The more I watch I feel the more I like Ahsoka above most of the other characters. Sure we have Kenobi (also a favorite), Luke, Yoda, Plo Koon (I just liked his look as a kid and liked him even more when they flesh out his character) but I just feel she is still above the rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me just say I think she’s hands down one of the most badass characters. She survived an encounter with Grievous (TWICE), something several Jedi across different levels of mastery were unable to do. She also stood toe-to-toe with Ventress, hive mind Barris, fought pretty decently against Anakin (Mortis), survives Pre Vizla (even almost beating him), what I can only assume is a fight against Maul which will be cut short, kills an Inquisitor, beats a few more, and then gives VADER a run for his money. She’s also a Clone Wars war hero who performs several outstanding acts throughout: tough fights, saving senator from assassination, protecting younglings, fighting pirates, leading rebels to victory. Oh yea, and she’s only 14-17 throughout her first war. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, she reaches a level of attunement with the Force that we rarely see. She is hinted as still being alive around the time of Ep. 9 and she telepathically communicates with Rey. She’s also purified 2 kyber crystals, something that isn’t really touched upon but seems difficult. And she’s very centered and pretty much the ideal Jedi by the end of her Rebels story. She even goes by Ashla (if I remember right) during her exile, which is later defined as a term for the Force itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, she’s just a very well fleshed out character. I think part of the reason I like the character is that it seems to contain the better parts of Anakin and a lot of wisdom. We get to see a full character arc and outcome that gets fleshed out in a book and two series. I feel Rey had potential, but creative differences really soured it in the 8-9 time gap. I also feel like Luke is a GREAT character but gets kind of tarnished a bit because of his depiction in TLJ. I like the movie and depiction of him as a broken man, but we don’t really ever get the development that led him to think of killing his own nephew and abandoning his role. Anakin is obviously a contender, but he has his flaws. If there’s 2 comparable characters to their story and how they got there I feel like Kenobi and Maul are the next two in line.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Ahsoka has a great narrative and character build that make her a favorite character. On the level of Maul and Kenobi in terms of stories and likability. Also she’s just a very strong Jedi and a blend of the better parts of other characters while still unique in her own right. Also Plo Koon is cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry this is a long post I just really appreciate the time and effort Lucas, Filoni, and the rest of the LucasFilm team but into making Ahsoka’s character.\n",

      "So i recently watched star wars the clone wars and im currently at season 3\n",

      "After all u can clearly see in the assasination episode that sings tries to kill padme, she fails because asoka interrupts her, after that u can see ziro in prison CLEARLY\n",

      "So the escape of ziro in season 1 happens AFTER the events of assasination and after boba and sings mission kill windu\n",
      "\n",

      "How the fuck can she be in banes crew after she lost the fight against asoka (u cant say she wasnt arrested)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before you attack me, hear me out. I'm not asking if the prequels should be re written, filmed with better actors or anything. Possibly my biggest problem with the trilogy is it's outdated CGI and overuse of it in Episodes II and III. Whilst there obviously can't be a change to how much was used, it can be updated. Since they have the money, Disney could easily do a \"remaster\" if you will, for the effects in the films. And whilst they're at it, they could also do extended versions. I for one, would love to see Episode III in it's 4 hour version, even if a lot of that content is in The Clone Wars. And as long as the original versions are still available, what harm could it do? (A lesson that George Lucas should have learned.)\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: The prequels would benefit from better CGI.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thought it was alright. 5/10. Average overall. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly the writing and continuity is just trash. But that ground work was set long ago in TFA, and also by TLJ having a different director with a vision that clashed with the other director. So the writing is whatever. Like, I'm pretty sure Palpatine had no mention in the previous two films and now here his name just pops up in the scroll? Like what? But again.... whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where this movie shines is the visuals. It looks pretty damn good. Lovely film grain. Lots of different enivornments. Lots of big vista shots. It's pretty alright. One of the best looking sw films for sure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, a lot of the humour here actually landed for me. I found most of the humour in the previous 2 films kinda cringe but here I actually laughed quite a few times. So props there. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then another downside the whole final quarter (or whatever) of the film - the attack on exicil. I felt this wasn't great. Just kinda standard stuff but since it tries to wrap up story elements and, once again, these sequels have godawful writing, then it kinda fails there. And once again the big bad dies wayy to easy. Just like snoke. I mean snokes death was just idioitic with that \"I know EVERYTHING!\" speech and then immediately being blind sided. And now ehre the Emporer shoots about actual sized lightening bolt from his hands and decimates the sky and then he gets undone by someone simply holding a lightsaber? Pathetic. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I think it's the best of the sequels. I liked that the trio spent time together on adventures, unlike TLJ where they were all split up. TFA was just action set piece after action set piece. I hate that film.\n",

      "Something I don't remember seeing much of at all was the timeframe between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I do remember a great deal of exploration of Qui-Gon and his training of Obi-Wan, but I only ever remember a single piece of media involving Padawan Anakin pre-Clone Wars - a cameo appearance in a comic miniseries focused on Jedi Masters doing... something. All I remember is A) Windu and several other masters go to Nar Shadaa, B) while on Nar Shadaa, they encounter a woman who claims her daughter was taken in by the order, and C) a cameo appearance by Padawan Anakin when Ki-Adi-Mundi (I think) sees him chatting away with the half-Tusken padawan A'sharad Hett, Anakin expressing to the master something along the lines of \"I thought all Tuskens were bad people, but this guy's alright\" or somesuch (which, after AoTC, is pretty \"oof\" in hindsight).\n",

      "Also Racer's Revenge, but I don't even know if that's even part of Legends canon.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "so when the last jedi came out, i loved it (and i still do). i remember saying to my friend when we walked out of the theater ‘that was everything i could’ve asked for from a sequel to TFA.’ i went online and was baffled to see so much negative reception and disappointment, i really didn’t get it. in fact it kind of pissed me off, the way anybody who liked TLJ was shot down or dismissed; there’s so much to love about that movie and i was upset that people couldn’t see that.\n",
      "\n",
      "ENTER TROS. i was scared going into the theater bc i worried the movie couldn’t possibly live up to the first two for me. from the opening crawl i was apprehensive and as the movie went on i became more and more disappointed with the direction it was going and the storytelling choices it made. by the time the last battle came around i was tearing up because i felt NOTHING—here’s the climax i’ve waited three years to see and i don’t even care what happens. the final scene to me was like the cherry on top—i stood up to walk out before JJ’s name even came up. i was angry. i felt jaded. i felt like something I loved had just been ‘ruined’.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i guess my point is i get it now. the way people were reacting to TLJ is almost the exact reaction I had to TROS. i’d like to apologize to everyone i vehemently defended TLJ to when probably all they wanted to do was rant and vent their frustration. we all like different stuff and to say someone’s wrong for liking or disliking something is invalidating how they felt about it. people have talked over my complaints about TROS and now i realize what people who disliked TLJ went through after that film.\n",
      "\n",
      "also, i’m just sorry in general to all of us that we didn’t get a better more cohesive trilogy. it sucks to get SO excited about something and have it let you down completely.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now I’ve fully enjoyed all SW movies with the exception of AOTC, but that wasn’t what this post is about. Looking back on it, I think the best Star Wars movie released post-OT is ROTS. There’s so many good scenes in this movie. I mean right off the bat it starts off super entertaining with count dooku being killed, and then soon after they foreshadow Anakins inevitable demise with him and palpatine talking and palpatine saying how one must understand all sides of the force. That right there set the tone for the entire movie and kept me hooked the whole time. I think personally my favorite part is the ending after palpatine executes order 66. So much tension after that. Anakin going to the dark and slaughtering all the innocent people, shocking padme and showing he’s never going back. And then one of my favorite fights, not just in the movie but the entire franchise, with obi vs anakin. So many great moments and, imo, a great ending to an otherwise mixed trilogy. \n",

      "The Force Awakens takes place on only one planet. It's a lush green planet and home to a society of priests and priestesses (clean, minimalist, white and yellow aesthetic and buildings, they're very rich because of a rare mineral found on that planet) and it begins with scenes of a young child training with a stick and meditating, called Rey. She's shown to be talkative around other students (but was always an independent girl) and stubbornly does what she thinks is right. She grew up on tales about Luke Skywalker, who has been gaining a lot of reputation in the galaxy, so she's also very idealistic. She also reads a lot about space battles, adventurers and the like.  \n",

      "The First Order is not like the Empire, but more like a group of people trying to recreate what the Empire was through desperate force. Finn is a stormtrooper with a moral compass, and he's sent with a group to Rey's planet to attack the priest order, they got intel that they might be hiding Luke Skywalker there. They travel on a ship, Finn and an other character get into a fight (they had beef in the past) and Finn gets thrown off of the ship by them. He barely survives, wanders around and finds a group of priests who nurse him back to health, then administer Rey to watch over him. They bond, but Finn does not tell her he's a stormtrooper who wants out of the First Order. Neither of them are aware that Rey is force sensitive, but there are subtle clues.  \n",

      "Han Solo comes into the picture, smuggling supplies to the priests. Before landing with the Falcon, he has an emotional talk with Leia, which feels like goodbye (he makes a remark how their hologram conversations always feel like they're gonna be the last). What he, and others don't know is that the leaders of these priests are conducting illegal experiments on a certain alien species' children (who are being smuggled onto the planet by people like Han, although Han himself doesn't do that). Their aim is to artificially make people Force sensitive and get powers.  \n",

Meanwhile, Rey's force sensitivity has been getting stronger lately, and she notices weird patterns that she hasn't before. She also senses the pain of the alien children, and knows something isn't right. She joins Han and Finn at the bar.  \n",

He tells her he used to be a Stormtrooper because now she's a friend of his (and he has a crush on her). They beat Finn's team, Finn shoots the guy who threw him off the ship, but one of the stormtroopers makes a distress call towards the First Order. A bigger ship will arrive soon.  \n",

      "So with Disney+ I've finally been able to watch the entirety of Rebels. Im currently at the Episode where they meet Rex, Wolf and Gregor. They say that they removed their inhibitor chips so they didn't execute Order 66. My question is, HOW did they do it? After Fives got his inhibitor chip removed he was deemed mentally unstable. How did Rex and the others manage to get their chips removed without being deemed mentally unstable as well? Before rebels there is never any episode in the clone wars about Rex removing his inhibitor chip. Perhaps that's explained In a comic that I'm not aware about. Also a little side question: How did Rex and Wolf meet Gregor? I'm fairly certain there's a comic about that but I can't find it anywhere. Thank you for reading my question, hope somebody can answer it.\n",

Now I know both properties are different, Star Wars is a space opera that has more focus on action while Star Trek is Hard Sci Fi more focus on exploration, both Star Trek has had crossovers with X-men, Transformers, Green-Lantern , Doctor Who, Legion of super heroes, but yet not with Star Wars, the work that it is often compared to and this is even before the Disney purchase.

Many of us grew up with this bad ass renegade stormtrooper who became a jedi and installed a jedi school with luke skywalker. Dark forces/Jedi knight was my all time favourite video game series. I do know that he is out of the game because of the movie rogue one which is now canon. So it was not him who stole the plans of the death star.

      "It blows my mind that Anakin had visions of his turn while confronting the Son and really never did anything to change nor even considered them when confronted with them during the movies. I understand this is mostly because the movies were there before the show but do you all think this is a continuity error or is simply an intentional part of Anakin's personality that is further meant to highlight his arrogance and short sightedness. I personally think this was considered before they finished that arc during the show and meant it to highlight how blinded Anakin was by his own hatred and anger during Episode III. I personally havent seen season 7 of the Clone Wars if there are any spoilers involved please leave it out of this discussion.\n",

Spit balling but whatever. And of course there’s the Rebels continuation series whenever that show is ready. But the character is so overdone at this point it’s really irritating to see her soak up the majority of the screen time in this final season of clone wars.

Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors. Lightsaber awesomeness is based off of the color, hilt design, and any unique aspects.\n",

      "VERY rough outline/idea. But I feel this would’ve been deeper and more substantive, add more to her character, and not feel like filler until the Mandalore arc.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Ahsoka left the Order, she set off to find herself. She thinks she really needs to get as far away from the Jedi as possible, give herself space and time to think. After some time, she decides to go back to her homeworld of Shilli where she was born and where Master Plo found her. She finds her family, the one from which she was taken all those years ago, and we get to see how she and her family deal with their reunion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We get to see how taking force sensitive children affects families. Maybe, since Ahsoka was always on the frontlines with the poster boys of the Republic’s war effort (Anakin and Obi-Wan) despite being a child, we could see her families regret of giving her up and their resentment of the Jedi for taking her and “turning her into a child soldier, (along with their clone slaves).”\n",
      "\n",
      "We really get to reckon with these parts of Jedi philosophy, and this builds up even more reason to believe the Jedi aren’t as great as they seem to be, all high &amp; mighty, taking children from families with little regard for how that can affect everyone. This gives more reason to believe the people of the galaxy would turn on the Jedi as we get closer to Episode III.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, despite loving her family, she gets tangled up with some crime that she traces back to Coruscant and decides she can’t live a normal life anymore. After everything she’s gone through, and everything she’s been taught, it’s too hard for her to let bad things happen knowing she has the power (more than most) to help stop those things... plus, maybe she misses action more than she thought she would.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, she departs back to Coruscant. \n",
      "\n",
      "There, living in the lower levels, she really gets to see how bad things are even on the capital planet of the Republic! \n",
      "\n",
      "She sees how the distraction of the war has preoccupied the Jedi from taking care of things back home, and she sees just how deep corruption runs through Coruscant and the Republic as a whole, and how much of it stems from the Underworld. \n",
      "\n",
      "She decides to become a vigilante, working to take down crime syndicates and save innocent lives. She’s found who she is again, a peacekeeper and someone who fights for justice and for the little guy. This takes her into conflict with the Pyke Syndicate and other cartels. From there, she deduces their connection to Maul on Mandalore. She meets Bo Katan and agrees to help them take on Maul.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s how we get to the Mandalore Arc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see how public opinion turns on the Jedi, we see how some families handle losing their children to the Jedi, we get more of the criminal underworld, and perhaps more importantly for Ahsoka as a character - We get to see Ahsoka deal with some awful tenants of the Jedi Order, which informs the rest of her life and leads to the confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader in which she so famously proclaims... “I’m no Jedi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, that’s just how I envisioned the continuation of her story. I still like parts of what we did end up getting, but it feels rather slow, pretty inconsequential/meaningless (especially since we’re really not gonna see Trace and Rafa ever and so much time was spent on them nonetheless), and not very deep or substantive for Ahsoka’s character.\n",

      "The Chosen One prophecy states that\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;\"A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people see Anakin's act of killing Palpatine in ROTJ as the ultimate balance in the Force being restored. But Palpatine comes back in TROS and dies by Rey's hand, so that must make Rey the Chosen One, right? Not exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, **Rey cannot be the Chosen One because she had a father.** It doesn't matter whether you consider him a \"nobody\" like Kylo did in TLJ, we know he exists, we know he's a clone of Palpatine, we've seen him in flashbacks in TROS, so that already rules Rey out for this aspect of the prophecy. Luke is similarly ruled out - his father is, of course, Anakin. (Another case could be made that the prophecy specifies a male Chosen One, but that could really just be chalked up to gender-neutral language.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So why do I still believe that Anakin is the Chosen One? The prophecy states that **\"through [the Chosen One] will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.**\" Even if the final defeat of the Sith was in 35ABY in Exegol, 31 years after Anakin's death, can it not be said that \"through Anakin\", ultimate balance in the Force was restored? After all, almost all of Anakin's actions and decisions in the Prequel and Original Trilogies wind up directly impacting the Sequel Trilogy. In TLJ, Rey mentions Anakin's redemption to Luke and compares him to Ben; had Anakin not turned to the Light Side it's unlikely she would have been so convinced that Ben could be turned if he hadn't. (Also, Luke might've probably been dead, but you get my point.) Ben's entire motivation hinges upon trying to emulate his grandfather, and realising that he ultimately wasn't. Luke's failure between the Original and Sequel Trilogies stemmed fron his fear that Ben was going to become another Vader. This is why I get slightly annoyed when people say that the Sequels aren't about Anakin's legacy because Anakin never appeared as a Force Ghost - he may not have appeared, but his presence is deeply felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I've always taken the Skywalker Saga as a mythic tale (after all, Lucas based Luke off of Joseph Campbell's monomythic \"Hero of a Thousand Faces\"). And one thing about prophecies in ancient mythology like Greek and Roman ones is that prophecies usually hinge upon wordplay and double-meanings, in that they usually never mean exactly what they say. Due to this, I'm far more inclined to take the \"through him\" aspect of the prophecy far less literally, and more in how Anakin's actions impacted his family and those around them in order to end the Sith.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, Anakin's actions basically set the stage for the complete and final destruction of the Sith in Exegol - Luke, Leia, Rey and Ben all being part of this aspect of the prophecy in how many of their actions and decisions were directly as a result of Anakin's deeds and his legacy. The way I see it, the Skywalker Saga (Episodes I-IX) basically tell the story of the Chosen One and the final defeat of the Sith, just that it took 67 years and 3 wars for it to finally end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, all of this is merely my interpretation of things. If you disagree, that's absolutely fine. Just try not to be an asshole about it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don't watch Star Wars film to analyse plot details and expect an incredible Oscar-winning story, but at times there are certainly things that could have been done better. One issue I had with TRoS, is how at no real point was I ever expecting any of the main characters to bite the dust. The last film in saga is always going to have a happy ending and I knew this, but that moment when the entire cinema thought that Rey had just accidentally killed Chewie? Good lord I was honestly so shocked. But I did kind of feel cheated with the fake out.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the story of Rey's potential turn to the dark actually seem plausible, killing Chewie off here would have absolutely been a brilliant way to begin that subplot. They killed off Han in TFA, (probably should've killed off Leia in TLJ but that's another topic) so why not kill Chewie here? I love that Wookie but killing off another fan favourite like this would have been a seriously impressive move from the filmmakers for me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Looking at the sequel trilogy now I feel the actors did a good job (Adam Driver is superb) and thought the cinematography and the visuals they created were excellent. However the story was utter horseshit. If the studio had the balls to let one director/writing team to see through a complete vision we would have 3 complete trilogies, not just 2. The EU before Mickey came along has so much great material to work with. Imagine a trilogy with Grand Admiral Thrawn as the main antagonist. Oh what could have been...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "\n",
      "I know the romance part was pretty cringe worthy and had awful dialogue. But I understood why Lucas wanted to have this as a focus.  It set the stage for Anakins downfall really well.  Showing him seeing visions of his mother dying and it turning out to be true and the Tuskegee raider slaughtering.  They needed to show how much Anakin loved padme so his turn to the dark side over saving her is more dramatic and he wasn’t just some desperate dude who falls in love quick .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Obi wans whole storyline and investigating the clone troopers was great.  Ewan’s Obi wan is the MVP in general of the prequels and I feel\n",
      "This is where he really stood out was in this movie\n",
      "\n",
      "The fight scene with Jango Fett and the scene before that where Obi wan is questioning him.  Just awesome.  Lucas was able to\n",
      "Make a fight scene with a Jedi and a bounty hunter with no lightsaber incredibly entertaining .\n",
      "\n",
      "Count dooku was great and his battle with Anakin and Obi wan was awesome \n",
      "\n",
      "I know we didn’t get a lot of it.  But when we see\n",
      "The clone army appear and the battle on genosis was just epic.  Wish we saw more of that on the big screen .\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I started playing Battlefront 2 again recently because of all the praise it's been getting and how \"Dice totally improved it\" and \"it's a completely different game now\". I have to say I'm having a blast playing especially now I'm in self quarantine. For anyone that hasn't given it a shot I plead you to do so, Dice really deserves the money and support for making the game this dramatically better since launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one awesome thing I've noticed upon joining the Battlefront subreddit, following Insta pages and the devs Twitter accounts is how calm and collective everyone is. For comparison just take a look a subreddits like r/saltierthancrait or r/saltierthankrayt, both full of people circle-jerking over what they hate. Then there's the meme communities which are pretty tame as it's mostly just joking around but in the Battlefront community all you see is calm and honest discussion and showing appreciation for one another. I actually saw a prequel lover and a sequel lover discuss their differences and then ask for each others usernames to play, it's unreal sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you're torn on the content autistic screeching of most Star Wars communities I urge you to be a part of Battlefront, it's a breath of fresh air in a current world where opinions have right and wrong answers.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning. 1977. And only today was I thinking about this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Does Leia know that she's adopted? I mean IN the original trilogy when Luke tells her they are brother and sister... is she just realizing that she's adopted? It's not mentioned in any of the original films and obviously Lucas didn't have certain things in mind from the beginning. In A New Hope she's just the princess, in Empire there's the kiss between her and Luke so even then she wasn't intended to be his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say this because I have a theory that fixes the hole/contradiction when she mentions remembering her mother. People call it a flaw because of Padme dying at childbirth. And Luke saying, \"Your REAL mother...\" should give a person pause (like why did you just say \"real\"?) but what if she didn't know she was adopted and her \"real\" mother, aka Bail Organa's wife, died when she was young? Maybe he remarried and she was talking about her birth mother? I assume part of keeping the Skywalkers hidded might include NOT telling them the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, Luke doesn't remember his mother so how and why would he ask Leia if she did if they're twins?\n",
      "\n",
      "Am I missing something? I know there have been countless books and retcons but in 1983 that scene and dialogue is not problematic at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I do like the idea of bio organic tech and a species that despises droids, and even intergalatic threats. What I don't care for is the extra galactic beings that have no imprint in the Force, something that doesn't seem like it would be restricted to one galaxy. The Ysalamiri are one thing, they evolved the ability to produce a bubble that negates the force to protect themselves from force sensitive predators, but the Yuuzhan Vong are 'absent' in the Force for no real reason. And basically all Force abilities don't effect them. Oh and the adding them into the past, like Canderous's experience. And spacers aren't tight lipped about strange experiences. That feels weird outside the unknown regions. They seem almost over powered...the force immunity is a big thing though...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I was looking at the character art and bio's again and I don't know why I didn't realize this before or why I haven't seen anyone mention it. But with Vernestra being knighted when she is 16 that means she didn't spend all that long as a Padawan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Jedi are taken as padawans when they are 12 with some being taken as early as eleven and thirteen being seen as being old (Obiwan was taken as a padawan when he was 13 and knighted at 23).\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that if she was taken at the youngest age group of 11 to be trained by her master that would mean she was a padawan for 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is being treated as something special and unique that happened to her. TCW mentioned how odd it was to make a teen a knight (you know when they tried to bribe Ahsoka with knighthood. Anakin was knighted at 19 and that was remarked as being unusually young) let alone one as young as Ahsoka. And we know from characters like Barris and Mayze Raynshi that they age like humans do so this isn't a baby yoda situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm now even more interesting in what could have happened that would cause her to be put up for promotion to knighthood at such a young age and after so few years partnered with her master.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you had the chance to OK 3 projects for Disney/ Lucasfilm to start developing now, what would they be? I've got a few that come to mind instantly, and these are in descending order:  \n",
      "1) A new miniseries from Tartakovsky that serves as a spiritual Ep X, focused on the aftermath of IX (Finn's force sensitivity, Zorii and Poe, Rey's next steps, Lando and Janna, New Republic politics, etc.)  \n",
      "2) EA signing for a KOTOR Remake, done in a similar vain as Fallen Order but character creation  \n",
      "3) A new movie set during the Prequel era with most of the original cast, but tangential to III's plot and more character focused.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, as almost everyone I have decided that the best way to entertain myself during the quarantine is by undergoing a Star Wars marathon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I was watching episode 2 after having watched the first yesterday, and I was wondering why the droid army in the first episode is under the control of the trade federation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t it property of the separatists?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know well that the separatists appear in the second but still I can’t quite grasp this whole matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have come up with a couple of explanations and I would like to know what you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "A) The droid army is an asset of the trade federation and it is dedicated to the separatist cause when the treaty on Geonosis is signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) The droid army is in reality property of the sith and the trade federation is just helped by that very same army in occasion of the invasion of Naboo. In the first episode we can clearly see the Viceroy obeying to Dart Sidious.\n",
      "\n",
      "A, B or something else?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So with the developments in the latest Clone Wars episode, is it possible that they could be bringing together Clone Wars, Rebels and The Mandalorian storylines? \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t see anything in rules directly relating to spoilers for Clone Wars but I’ll be as vague as I can be in an attempt to not spoil it. If you are totally against any hints at all about CW’s latest ep then stop reading now. \n",
      "\n",
      "My theory is that the current CW episodes are foreshadowing some sort of story mechanism to tie into Mando in one way. That is yet tbd but I think we can see paths that could happen. Given that they’ve cast an adult Ahsoka for Mando, I could see Sabine and Ahsoka while looking for Ezra running into Mando in some capacity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m curious to hear others takes on this, if it’s been discussed already please point me towards that link. I have some loose details around it all, so I’d love to look through others takes on how it could all go down or how you’d like to see it happen.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ok for English every Friday we would not do work a read a book of your choice and then at the end of the marking period we would have a project due on it. I picked A New Dawn for my book and now we are doing the project we were supposed to do it a few week ago but with everything that’s goin on it was pushed back. \n",
      "\n",
      "But anyways part of the project is we have to pick 3-5 themes that go on throughout the book and explain them. So far I have evil, and fate. Evil goes with out saying for the people who have read it. And fate because it’s like the conversation Kanan and Hera had in season for with they were meant to meet Ezra and be on lothal. In the beginning of the book Kanan and Hera had a few chances to meet but they didn’t, and even when the first time they meet and Hera chooses to just leave on the spot. It just happens to be the cantina she was meeting at was where kanan worked part time. It also connect to what qui gon said in the phantom menace “nothing happens by accident” he says something else but I can’t remember it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I need two more or atleast one more theme. If anything has read the book thinks of one please let me know, I’m having a hard time coming up with more themes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've just started watching the Star Wars saga and would love to get suggestions on the best watch order that I could follow. I came across the following list and was wondering if this is a good order:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story*\n",
      "2. *Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope*\n",
      "3. *Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back*\n",
      "4. *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones*\n",
      "5. *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith*\n",
      "6. *Solo: A Star Wars Story*\n",
      "7. *Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi*\n",
      "8. *Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens*\n",
      "9. *Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi*\n",
      "10. *Star Wars: Episode XI – The Rise of Skywalker*  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've already watched Ep. IV and V\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've just watched episode 9, and the characters carried that film. It wasn't well written and a lot of the stuff was recycled through the whole trilogy. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I remember reading that Palpatine is Anakin's dad. He made his mother pregnant through the force. I don't know if that is true, but I thought it was interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if Palpatine is Rey's Grandfather, and Ben's great grandfather, and they decide to fall in some sort of messed up love. Star Wars lore is big on incest. That's worse than Luke with Leia when she \"didn't know.\"\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I'm a fan of the machete order viewing of the original and prequel trilogies, and I don't want to debate that (here).  But during this quarantine, I really, really want to find things to share with my kids. I have 3 boys, though only the older 2 are in the discussion here.  6 and 4.5 years old.  What have fellow redditors done wrt sharing Star Wars with their kids? \n",
      "\n",
      "Second question, and the reason I brought in machete order... Phantom Menace might be the most kid friendly, and given it's place outside of the machete order, it could be a candidate for a standalone adventure with the kids for now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm thinking about making a Star Wars OC and am designing my own lightsaber for him. My question is how long can the blade of a lightsaber BLADE be? Throughout Legends and Canon we see countless examples of unique lightsabers. Some are short, some have three blades, some are more like daggers, some have unique shapes and sizes. I have seen a good number of these and am curious as to if it is possible to have a lightsaber blade that is longer than most? \n",
      "My idea is to have my character have a similar fighting style to that of Alucard in Castlevania. His sword is nearly seven feat long and he uses it like a rapier. \n",
      "Are their any examples of this in the lore? What would be the cause for a lightsaber such as this? Theoretically how long could one be?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is probably the series I read the most of my EU collection mostly because I love seeing the kids grow as characters. When Jacen accidentally removes Tenel's arm and they grow closer as friends and more...very well written and dealt with a lot of real emotion and trauma. Seeing him finally making her laugh was such a treat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But nothing beats when they are trapt on Ryloth freezing to death. It was heart wrenching when they are laying there barely alive and she just whispers \"Tell me a joke.\"...\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a huge shame on how Jacen ends up later but nothing will remove my enjoyment of those young adult books no matter what my age.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Star Wars, is just levels beyond almost all other intellectual properties and fictional universes. It is one of the few worlds that almost feel real to me when I’m watching it. Star Wars is just, so awesome, I’m thankful all the time that George Lucas did what he did in 1977. A coworker of mine said she saw a new hope in theaters when it came out and that she and all of her friends were absolutely blown away. I told her that it still has that affect 40 years later. Star Wars, is just the perfect fictional world.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Going to get right into it, no time wasted on intros. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Episodes:** Both 1 and 8 are really really bad. I don't know how the bookends managed to be so poor in comparison to everything in between. The rest of the episodes are pretty good. I especially like episode 2 with the Sand Crawler and Jawas. Very cool, and was the episode that made me most feel like I was watching Star Wars. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Characters:** Mostly a win here. All of them are interesting and unique, except the forced in female badass that has to be everywhere now. She's an alright character, but you can tell they're trying waaaay too hard to make her this total badass with her laser mini gun! Pretty poor acting chops too. Better as a MMA fighter. \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE that they got Pascal to play Mando. He was fantastic in Prospect as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lead antagonist is horribly miscast, Moff Gideon. I keep expecting him to walk off set and come back with a bucket of chicken. He's just not opposing or intimidating at all and feels like he's phoning in his role. His cool, calm demeanor works wonders in Breaking Bad, where he's this huge kingpin hiding a drug empire through chicken restaurants, but Star Wars villains need to be a bit more threatening and have some gravitas to them. Gideon feels like he has all the gravitas of a 3 piece meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Music/Score:** Total garbage. The main theme grows on you a bit, Mandos, but everything else barely passes as placeholder. The whole western motif trying to be Star Wars is pretty lame and is definitely sub par to anything John Williams has produced for the universe. It doesn't even come close. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wish they would actually use the original music and Williams's work. Whenever I see Baby Yoda pick something up, I want that slow creep of the horn to come in just like in the Wampa cave in episode 5. The Force Theme has no rival.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Editing and Pacing:** Hit and miss here. The side dissolves and upwards wipes are there lol, but the show feels like a Netflix production forced into the Star Wars universe. I can't really describe it. Some of it is fantastic, but it just doesn't flow as well as it should. A lot of the directing is setting up mediocre tropes  that worked well when Avengers came out in 2012, but is pretty predictable and unimaginative at this point in 2020. It's familiar and definitely not as exciting. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Sets/Costumes/Props:** Have to give it to them here. Everything is working as intended and everything from the backdrops to the actual gadgets the main characters use are awesome. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only critique here is that you can tell some of the sets are small on purpose to save on costs. I think with a bit more funding they could have eliminated this vibe, but many scenes are shot very tightly and you can tell the scene only exists inside the camera lens. It feels like if you were to look further, the scene would cease to exist and you'd see extra's, stage hands and material lying around, which pulls you out of the world a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Script/Story:** A solid B. WAAAAAY better than the prequels scripts, I'll give the show that. The Fav can outwrite Lucas and it mostly works. There are a few cringe moments \"This is the way!\" and some lines that don't seem as genuine as they should, but this is mostly due to the acting. The underlying story is also very interesting and works well with the dynamic between Mando and Baby. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just my thoughts on the show. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yours?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Why did the Mandalorian change his mind about taking Yoda? He said in Episode 4 that a kid travelling in a ship...something...is no life for a kid...something like that, but we see Yoda in the Razor Crest at the beginning of Episode 5....so he changed his mind? \n",
      "\n",
      "And then there was no explanation as to why they were being chased...as I was watching I was guessing...okay, are we going to have a ‘24 hours before’ to explain why they’re being chased? Nope. I suppose the only plausible explanation is because the pilot was hunting down Yoda 🤷🏼‍♂️. But no clarification. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the ending....hmm! I reckon the mysterious cape possibly belongs to Giancarlo’s Moff Gideon character because he has a cape, he’s a villain and the sniper girl was also a villain so perhaps they were allies 🤷🏼‍♂️\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "1) The Last Jedi.... Think about that title. Luke was a confirmed Jedi, so the title has to be referring to him. For him to be the last, it means there was no other and wouldn't be another. Further, the sacred Jedi Texts were done away with formally and officially. Literally this movie is all about how the Jedi are no more.\n",
      "2) She could use force lightning, no Light-side Jedi ever could and it's usually considered a dark side power. \n",
      "3) The obvious: she's a Palpatine \n",
      "4) She wouldn't have been a sith, of course, since she didn't succumb to the dark side - a grey Jedi M.O is to be able to dabble a bit with the dark side of the force but not fall into it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While I can respect the original movie as the progenitor of this series, the baby of George Lucas and one of the biggest stamps on movie history, I just don't find it that entertaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really don't know what it is either. Effects are outstanding for the time, some very memorable scenes but I find it lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. Something that's missing which allows me to get a lot of enjoyment from a lot of the other movies. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll say again that it is a great movie from a technical standpoint and I don't have a major complaint but I just don't find it entertaining. Your thoughts?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Obviously, Star Wars is known for its memorable villains, all of whom are (usually) Sith or Dark Side users. But after rewatching the prequels, I got thinking: what would it be like if there was a Star Wars movie where the antagonist is a Jedi?\n",
      "\n",
      "As many have noted, the prequels explore the failures and hypocrisies of the Jedi, and how the very order is in part, responsible for its own downfall. I think it’d be interesting to see a movie where this exploration is continued via a Jedi antagonist. Maybe this particular character believes in the Jedi code, but is an extremist; to them, anybody who doesn’t support the Jedi or the Republic is instantly enemy. Maybe they’re obsessed with the light side, and in an effort to purify the Force, seek to destroy all remnants of the Dark side throughout the galaxy. Obviously, this could cause some conflict due to their violent rampage, thus leading to a story where said character is an antagonist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe this seems like a stretch, but personally, after seeing the ST simply mimic the OT in almost every way, I can’t help but wonder about the numerous original possibilities the films could’ve taken. All in all, I’d love to hear what you all think.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Imagine if the entire mythology of the Sith for the past 1000 was based on a cruel lie - and that Darth Bane actually survived in the bodies of his apprentices for 1000 years through transference.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if Bane manipulated apprentices to \"kill\" him in an act of gaining the dark side mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for themselves but which would actually be a dark side ritual Bane would use to inhabit their bodies? This would have made for an incredible twist in ST, that Palpatine wasn't even himself but actually a very ancient Sith Lord who had shown incredible patience and cleverness in order to take down his ancient enemy: the Jedi Order.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would also keep to the prophecy to in that Darth Vader, redeemed by his son, destroyed Bane / Palpatine in an act of love for his son, not in an effort to seek more power and overthrow him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also: Could you imagine the prequel content for such a character and his engineering the destruction of the Sith of his time so he could control/manipulate one individual at a time until he was able to achieve his goal 1000 years later?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now that the dust has finally settled and everyone has had time to claim down about the sequel trilogy,I would to ask everyone a question.As you all know when the prequels started coming out the fans hated them,The backlash from fans was insane people started Attacking the actors and George Lucas for quote “ruining there childhood”,But eventually the generation that grew up with the prequels started to praise the films once they finally had a voice. However now I can’t help but feel a strange since of deja vu with history pretty much repeating it self ,but instead of people be angry at George their mad at Disney. So my question how do think future generations will the sequels once they’re old enough to have a voice.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I’ve been a big fan of Star Wars for the longest time and probably know just as much history and lore about it as I know actual history. My father was a big fan when he saw the original trilogy and the prequels. He’s also watched the newer movies too, but since we’re on quarantine, we want to catch up on everything but he’s still out most of the day for work and doesn’t have much time to catch up on the clone wars, so I’m asking if anyone has a list of the main important lore of the show, I’ve already watched the whole show myself, I just don’t know where to start for him to see. And I’m wondering if anyone knows where I can find Fallen order in the form of a movie, cause he doesn’t really like/understand how to play modern games so I rather we just watch some sort of cutscene edit of the game. And I’ve failed to find something of that sort. Thank you\n",

Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors.

Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors.

      "For me, I'd say that moment for me is when Rey lifts the rocks on crait and saves the Resistance to fight another day. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was growing up, I was the target market for the prequels. I've loved Star Wars my entire life and have countless great memories thanks to George's creation. I had so much to play with in this big universe. Whether I was playing video games like Jedi Power Battles or the pandemic Battlefront games, fighting with my friends over who got to be Anakin or Darth Maul in our plastic lightsaber fights, opening my 3rd version of Obi-Wan's action figure, or going with my dad and my three best buddies to watch Revenge of the Sith in theaters for my birthday, there was always new ways to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem was I could never get my little sister to love it as much as me. Sure, she would help me through the Mustafar level on Lego Star Wars and have some fun doing it, but even to this day as a young woman in college, she couldn't care less about Star Wars. The sequel trilogy has made me very aware of how hard it used to be for girls to insert themselves into Star Wars. That makes me sad because I feel like they're missing out. Carrie Fisher, Natalie Portman, and Ashley Eckstein's contributions should never be overlooked, but you can't argue with the positive impact that Rey being the main protagonist/hero in the sequels has had on female interest levels in the galaxy far far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why the lifting rocks moment in TLJ means so much to me. That was really the moment that cemented Rey as the main heroine and badass Jedi of the sequel trilogy in my opinion. The thought that a whole new demographic of people are taking their first steps into the larger world of Star Wars because they look up to Rey the same way that I looked up to Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi as a kid excites me and brings me more joy than anything else.\n",

      "Who is flying the Ghost in Episode 9? Would it really make sense for it to be Hera? I think it would have to, at the least, be her son, at this point. Considering that Hera was an adult during Rebels, and the ST takes place 34 years after Return, Hera would, at the least, be well into her 50's. Not out of the realm of still being a pilot, but her son would probably have taken over, wouldn't he? Or do you think she'd still be piloting with her son as co-pilot?\n",

      "To maximize demand for an extended version, they would leave deleted scenes off this release, just as Lord of the Rings did.    \n",
      "\n",
      "They would make zero mention of an extended version coming later, because as soon as they did, sales for the theatrical version would dry up. So they would stay silent about it. But subtle tips from actors about all the amazing extra scenes that were filmed would be a perfect way to build demand. Likewise, hints from art books of deleted content only serves to make fans salivate for an extended version all the more.      \n",

Each of these is weighted at 25%. I included lightsaber awesomeness because I know there are a lot of hardcore fans on this sub that I would piss off if I tried making a definitive list with the first three factors.

      "So here's a brief context. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was exposed to star wars from a young age due to some toys passed down to me from my mum/her siblings. Basically it was some plastic coins/disks collectible thing with the names of films/hologram of a character etc (not sure what they're called, if someone knows what I'm talking about itd be great). \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway that's how I came to know of star wars. Then i was watching TV and came across a Star Wars film or show (this was like early 2000s when I was like 5) and I remember seeing Darth Vader (and getting nightmares about him).\n",
      "\n",
      "I would see star wars toys in shops such as Argos but I never pursued it, although telling my self that I need to watch it some day.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 years ago, I came across star wars rebels and fell in love with it. This re-sparked my interest in Star Wars and I basically read so much about it on the Wiki that I almost knew everything that was canon, despite only having watched the first 3/4 Rebels seasons.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By this time I was pretty fascinated with Vader and felt sorry for Anakin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forgot about it, got a bit bored of it until this lockdown ensued. I was bored and didn't know what to watch so I decided to finish of Rebels. That again sparked my interest in star wars and I refreshed my knowledge and began watch first the Original trilogy and then the Prequel trilogy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although there was no need as I already knew lot of star wars lore, I felt I could not truly be a star Wars fan until I watched the original six films.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am proud to say that Ive finally finished Rebels and the original Six films. Rebels was always my favourite Star Wars media, and I'm looking forward to seeing the Ghost's crew again. Meanwhile, I will be watching the Mandalorian and then maybe the sequel trilogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for the terrible writing as I'm on mobile and can't be bothered to correct any mistakes.\n",

      "Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: \"I'm better than you!\" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rey is a boyish loner and doesn't likes romance. She got her friend Ben in a friend zone, but later, was too proud to accept that she felt in love with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.\n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I just started watching Rebels recently, and am still pretty early in the seasons. There was a line that Sabine says during a battle when she's docking with Ghost: \"I'm in the pocket, 5 by 1.\" There is a similar line from the movie Aliens that the combat pilot says on their approach to the world: \"We're in the pipe, 5 by 5.\" I know that the Aliens line us fairly common and means that they are flying true and on target but have never heard the '5 by 1' before. I assumed it was a nod to Aliens but maybe I just watch too much sci-fi. Any thoughts?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm going to start this off with saying that Solo is genuinely my favorite Star Wars movie. I'm a big fan of the series and I love every movie in the saga quite a bit. It makes me kind of sad that the fan base (or at least from what I've seen) doesn't really talk about it that much.  I saw it when it first came out in theaters and was shocked to find it didn't do well financially. I absolutely love Solo and I think a lot of people sleep on it for various reasons. I wanted to get my thoughts out in a post and talk about why I like it so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "* All of the actors do a great job portraying their characters\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo and think he did a great job portraying what a young han looks like. For me he really captured the essence and roguish charm of Han. Let's face it, playing Ford's Solo from the original trilogy gave Ehrenreich some really large shoes to fill but in my opinion he perfectly nailed it. The same could be said for Glover's Lando Calrissian, he did a great job playing an inexperienced and confident young version of the character, and I found Glover's and Ehrenreichs chemistry to be great, they played off each other very well.  Woody Harrelson as Becket and and Emilia Clark as Qi'ra provided really enjoyable supporting roles as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The action sequences are phenomenal\n",
      "\n",
      "From the train heist to the Kessel run, Solo is really fun to watch and some of the sequences are amazingly executed. My personal favorites are the Corellia chase scene and the final showdown between Han and Becket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It has a ton of charm and has a really satisfying ending\n",
      "\n",
      "There are very few moments in Star Wars that I enjoy more than Han failing badly at bluffing the thermal detonator in the Lady Proxima scene. The gambling scenes between Han and Lando are amazing as they constantly try to one-up one another.Does Solo hit all of the marks you would expect? Yes, We get the Kessel run, Han wins the Falcon from Lando, Han meets Chewie, etc. However, I really like how it hits those marks, to me it doesn't feel forced and somehow they managed to weave it all into a fun space-western style story.  I really like how Han was developed as well; at the start of the movie he's a naive kid scraping to survive with aspirations of adventure and becoming a pilot. He's not the Han we know from a new hope, a hardened, experienced, and sarcastic smuggler. We do, however, see the frame work of the Han we all know and love, although unwilling to admit it, Han is a rogue with a heart of gold and it shows during Solo. Qi'ra does a great job helping emphasize that aspect of his character and even points out as much point blank in the movie. Becket serves as a great foil to Han, showing him how he may eventually become: jaded and willing to betray others at a drop of a hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solo is a personal favorite of mine and wanted to know your thoughts on it. There's a lot I didn't touch on here like the great soundtrack, costume design, and interesting locations because this already got pretty rambley but I wanted to get my thoughts out there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Force is probably the greatest fictional “magic systems”. But the biggest problems with it is how many different interpretations people can have about it. I decided to just share my interpretation of the Force. For fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly I look towards George Lucas as a person and what beliefs he holds. Because this undoubtedly influenced how he created the force. From what we know George is a Christian and lived during the Free love movement. Along with an apparent curiosity of eastern religions. So I built my interpretation around these ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my Interpretation the Force is not only alive but life manifested. The force represents fate/destiny and can influence events to meet “its will” which I believe could mean the collective desires of the galaxy. Hence why The First Order, Empire and Sepretists were able to gain such power. Because people were desiring what these factions could bring and so the force moved the pieces to make it happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Father, Brother and Sister along with the wills are not true beings but just manifestations of the force that allow it to rely its will directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe that there can never be balance in the force. The dark side and light cannot exist in peace. Because the dark side is not a natural part of the Force, but a corruption of it. It is like an addiction. Like ICE or the incredibly addictive drugs, you can rehabilitate from it but you cannot use it repeatedly without getting addicted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I believe the force is in everyone, all people need is faith. not belief, faith. I also hate the idea of power in the force. The force belongs to everyone so everyone is just as strong in it, it is merely Understanding, Faith and the will of the force that decides ones strength. Atleast for the light side.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just some of my ideas about the force, what do you think the Force is.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Lucas's view of the Force, as I understand it, is basically that there is no Dark-Light dichotomy. The \"Light side\" is just the Force in it's \"natural\" state. The Jedi believed Force-adepts should strive for a peaceful, natural, almost symbiotic relationship with the Force. The Dark side is a general term for people trying to bend the Force too closely to their will, particularly for selfish or ignoble purposes, and the abilities that manifest as a result of that. That's supposedly why \"balance\" means \"a lack of Darkness,\" because Darkness is essentially just human (or alien?) depravity and megalomania twisting the Force into something unnatural. (If this is wrong let me know!)\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is true, how can the cave on Dagobah be, as Yoda describes in RotJ, \"strong with the Dark side of the Force\"? If it's a natural formation, shouldn't it be neutral in the Force if anything? How can something inanimate by Dark-sided if Dark-sidedness comes from selfishness and megalomania?\n",

Also that good old corruption and snails pace bureaucracy is still very much alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jedi are back, with a nice shiny new temple built on....not Coruscant. Why? Because 20ish years of imperial propaganda mixed with the knowledge that Vader was once a Jedi wasn’t great for public relations. Many in the republic senate, with a few more *convinced* by Remnant spies, felt the Jedi should be banished to the outer rim, but Leia, and Luke’s reputation, convinced the senate to allow the Jedi to set up in the mid rim. \n",
      "\n",
      "Luke has done a pretty good job with the Jedi order. It doesn’t have a lot of strictness of the old order, and many Jedi don’t carry light sabers. The order does have a small Knight caste, but with the lack of sith and the fact that no one wanted their help most Jedi don’t carry their sabers. Leia and Han’s son is in that caste. \n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier I mentioned the remnant, that’s what’s left of the empire. After Endor the empire was on its last leg. They take lose after lose until they are beaten back to only a handful of systems. The imperials, their backs against a wall, bet everything on one last stand. \n",
      "\n",
      "After Endor the rebels had skyrocketed in numbers. Many people saw it as a chance to get rich, though some saw it as a sort of tryout for the republic military council. The republic never associated itself with the rebels, and poached their leadership, so when the remnant made its final stand the army it was facing was too large for its supply lines, with no organization. The attack is shattered, the rebels cease to exist and the republic opens diplomatic channels with the remnant. The remnant is even granted a seat in the senate during a galactic pandemic. \n",

      "So remakes will happen, but not for a very long time. However, in the short-run (under quarantine), it is fun to speculate about what they could do to improve on the original movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As good as the OT were there were serious flaws that permeated them.  A remake could fix the following problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The CGI can portray Darth Vader as a massively powerful force user  (which, despite his considerable loss of power on Mustafar, he as the chosen one absolutely still is), which the OT couldn't quite do with its CGI limitations\n",
      "* The CGI can do the same thing with Obi Wan, Luke, and Palpatine\n",
      "* Dialogue can be massively improved (no more Leia calling Han \"laser brain\" or Luke quipping to Vader \"you'll find I'm full of surprises\")\n",
      "* As good as McDiarmid was as an actor, the makeup for the Emperor/post-Mace duel Palpatine sucked, and make him look too cartooinshly evil. (Think of how much more effective Senator Palpatine was as a character than the cartoonish Emperor in RotJ.) He would be more impactful as a character if he looked like a \"kindly\" old man with something twisted to hide; i.e. like a slightly deformed and somewhat \"frail\" version of Senator Palpatine\n",
      "* Relatedly, Palpatine's and Vader's (failed) attempt to win Luke to the Dark Side should be more subtle and built-up; of course Luke rejects the Dark side but it needs to be less obvious that he will do so than it is in OT\n",
      "* I honestly like the Ewoks, and think cutting them would be a bridge too far in terms of altering the OT's story; but the filmmakers need to (somehow) make their military prowess/victory over the Stormtroopers more credible. Maybe make the human-rebel force bigger, and able to contend seriously (albeit in a losing effort) against the Stormtroopers, until the Ewoks turn up and swing the tide of battle. (This is more credible than them being the entirety of the rebel force on Endor.)\n",
      "* RELATEDLY, have storm troopers shoot and not miss sometimes!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A quick fix to how this works is that it should be a reverse hyperspace tracking procedure. Stay with me for a bit here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enemies have hyperspace tracking and the gang tried to find and destroy the tracking technology but failed. Meanwhile Holdo and the rebels managed to find a signal that only appears during hyperspace that is basically the tracking technology signal linking their ship to enemy ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a last resort Holdo (and/or whoever other important rebel) manages to program their ship to haphazardly follow the Hyperspace tracking signal back to its source but since the signal follows channels no one has heard of, any ship using these routes is guaranteed to blow up. The explosion is so erratic that the debris exists in both hyperspace and normal space and obliterates anything ahead of it namely the Enemy ships that were doing the tracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the Holdo maneuver is born. It's essentially an ability that only exists because the light speed tracking exists.  It can only happen when light speed tracking is used. It creates a balance in the way the warfare works as the enemy now risks being immediately obliterated  every time they choose to track the rebels so they have to weigh the advantages of knowing the rebel locations versus losing a few hundred men for it. The rebels have to set up a \"Kamikaze squad\"/\"suicide squad\" of people on the ready to intercept the enemy tracking and then light speed ram their asses. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The clanky mechanics aren't even the important part. It's just sci-Fi. What's important is the power balance between sides during the warfare when such things as hyperspace tracking and light speed rams are invented. I think this fairly remedies such power balance issues.\n",

      "Now this is just my personal opinion but I genuinely think that Star Wars has never been about good triumphing over evil. It’s always been about The Force as it’s own entity trying to balance itself out. The Jedi are always talking about “bringing balance to the force” but the only thing they ever try to do is wipe out The Dark Side and destroy the Sith. But you can’t have balance with only one side present. The Force is not just a tool of the Jedi and Sith to be used and manipulated, it’s an entity living in all things, it doesn’t care about Good or Evil, Jedi or Sith, Light or Dark, because there is no Light or Dark side of The Force, there’s just The Force. If you look at the progression of all three trilogies chronologically every time one side gets too powerful The Force sends someone to the opposite side to create balance until that side gets too powerful and it sends another to the previous side. The original prophecy was true and came true, Anakin Skywalker was the one chosen by The Force to bring about balance to the force, he brought balance by putting more of the dark side into the mix. Then the Dark Side got too powerful so The Force sent Luke Skywalker to put more Light Side into the mix. Now the Light Side is too powerful, here’s Kylo Ren, too much Dark Side, Rey Palpatine enters. The entire time both sides thought they were using The Force but in actuality The Force was using them. I think that’s also why balance has been brought to The Force by the big names, Skywalker and Palpatine, The Force is in tune with them and their bloodline more because it chose them to bring balance, you can’t send Cal Kestis or Darth Maul or Cere Junda or Asaj Ventress because as much as we’d love to all feel special and like anyone can save the day no matter how small that’s not the case, you don’t send a boy to do a mans job, you don’t send children to fight a war, you send the one with the best chance of winning, The Force wants balance, it needs balance, and it will get it regardless of how I, you, or anyone else feels about it. This doesn’t mean that you can’t help in your own way, Rose’s gesture probably sparked a rebel in that child she met in that barn which would definitely help the cause and ripple into peace throughout the galaxy but she’s not enough to bring balance herself, Poe, Holdo, Leia, even Luke once he’d served his purpose while important in their own right are not enough to bring back balance it had to be the polar opposite of Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo, son of Han and Leia, nephew of Luke Skywalker, grandson of Darth Vader himself, Champion of both sides, but rejecting them all, he was the embodiment of The Dark Side but conflicted, able to be swayed closer to balance than you’d believe at first glance, and so who better to balance him out than Rey, daughter of unknowns, Champion of no one, the embodiment of The Light Side but like her adversary unsure of her placement in all of this she could be turned if you could get to her, but wait, she’s not just some random nobody, she’s the granddaughter of Darth Sidious aka Emperor Palpatine, slayer of the Jedi Order, there’s more to her than meets the eye, she is the only one strong enough to take on The Dark Side, because she is The Light Side, it’s not even completely about her bringing balance to The Force, without Kylo there would be no Dark Side to fight leaving only imbalance it had to be a Skywalker and so it had to be a Palpatine. Think of it as the ones who threw The Force out of balance are the ones who had to put it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tl;dr:**The Force is its own entity that doesn’t care for or want good to triumph over evil, it simply wants balance and will do whatever it deems necessary to get it.\n",

      "Okay now before we get carried away I'm going to explain a backstory. I have a very unpopular opinion of my favorite of the movies. I just watched The star wars movies for the first time in 2015 and I watched them in chronological order and personally I liked the story in 1, 2, 3 better than 4, 5, and 6. I know... I get a terrible reaction everytime I say that. However I just genuinely loved Anakin's origin story. I personally being the husband to a wife that has had 2 High-Risk pregnancies I personally feel that if I had a way of knowing my wife was going to die during labor I would probably turn to the Dark side to try to find a way to help. Now I'm not justifying the murdering of the kids but I feel at that point he had lost complete control to the dark side and was manipulated by Palpatine, but his initial reasoning for turning to it I completely understand. The seeing him come around at the end of 6 and save Luke locked it in for me that Anakin Skywalker Is my favorite character from the series by far.\n",

I recently showed my wife star wars for the first time and before she even finished any of the movies she fell in love with the name Anakin the second she heard it. We have our 3rd on the way and she is Dead set on naming the baby Anakin if it's a Boy. I however, even with Anakin being my favorite character, am especially torn on this. On one hand I love the name and think it has a good uniqueness to it. However I know it only derives from star wars and there is no getting around that. We plan to Homeschool (in today's school situation in America we decided its best) so were not concerned about the Bullying at school concern. (Would be some sibling punishment in that case lol) And outside the home I feel that kids 6 or so years from now and on aren't going to be commonly associated with star wars and even know what it comes from. Any adult that comes in contact with the child would know but definitely shouldn't be bullying a child.\n",

      "1. I am not very well trained in the ways of SW canon. I am just going to be speaking on the films for this. \n",

      "\n",
      "**The Main Issue**\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main problem I have with Ep. 9 bringing back Palpatine is I find it disrespectful to the story of the first 6 films. Ep. I-VI are the story of Anakin Skywalker. His arc is completed when he destroys the sith, brings balance to the force, and restores peace to the galaxy. But according to Ep. 9, Anakin's entire life didn't destroy the sith, it just set back Palpatine a few years. I thought this really hurt the original story. However, I loved watching Palpatine in Ep. 9. So I thought of a different way to bring Palpatine back.\n",

      "**In this version of the story:**  \n",
      "Palpatine is dead. He's dead. Snoke, on the other hand, is an extremely powerful Sith Lord. Not Palpatine's creation. The things Snoke does in TLJ throne room scene (throwing Rey with just the wave of a finger) suggest that he could be more powerful than Palpatine. (This was really just technological differences, but I'm gonna go with it for the story.) Anyway, every trilogy has an apprentice betray their master. \n",

      "Prequels: Palpatine betrays Plagueis\n",

      "Originals: Vader betrays Palpatine\n",

      "Sequels: Kylo Ren betrays Snoke\n",
      "\n",
      "Except in the version, the sequels get an original twist: Snoke is so powerful that he is able to foresee that Kylo betrays him. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can never be betrayed. I cannot be beaten!\" -Man who was betrayed and beaten seconds later\n",
      "\n",
      "So instead of talking out of his ass, Snoke actually has a plan here. With his physical body destroyed, Snoke needs to find a new vessel. He chooses, the corpse of Emperor Palpatine. So instead of Palpatine doing some random Sith stuff and transferring his consciousness to Exegol into some clone process nobody really understands, Snoke transfers his consciousness to the corpse of Palpatine in an Exegol Sith cemetery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it plays out in Episode IX**\n",
      "\n",
      "Kylo goes to Exegol just the same. He hears the voice of Snoke instead of Palpatine. He of course comes to kill Snoke, but Snoke offers him the Final Order and they get along. Snoke has the body and voice (Ian McDiarmid) of Emperor Palpatine, but he is still Snoke. He doesn't ever claim to be Palpatine. (He can still say some of the famous lines though, cause why not). Snoke also needs to explain to Kylo that his intense use of the dark side to transfer his consciousness has drained him (sorta like Luke or Ben's death), and that this is his last chance. This is so we know that when he dies this time, he's gone for good. (Unlike Ep. 9 giving us no explanation about how Palpatine won't come back again. I know there's one in the novelization, but it should've been somewhere in the film.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is Snoke's entire plan: to fake his death, then lure Kylo to Exegol so he can raise the Final Order and conquer the galaxy. He uses the corpse of Palpatine to carry this out. And yes, Snoke can use force lightning in Palpatine's body.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why do I like this better?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Palpatine is dead. He died in Episode VI like his should have. Anakin killed him. The way the canon has it, it seems as though Anakin's entire journey was for nothing. This way, Anakin's story has much more meaning.\n",
      "2. Even though Palpatine is dead, we still get to see Ian as Palpatine again, which is awesome. I guess Ian would be credited as Snoke/Palpatine.\n",

      "\n",
      "The machete viewing order was designed to adapt the prequels into the story of Luke, having episodes II and III as a flashback after ESB. i think that you can do the same thing with the sequels, watching the first two and omitting TROS because TLJ is the conclusion for luke's character.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are definitely problems- TLJ wasnt intended to be the finale and narratively, it leaves almost everything unresolved and open ended. This is helped by the messaging of the film *implying* an ending: rey reforms the Jedi and the first order are unable to maintain power because hope wont be extinguished yada yada yada. The issue is that, unless you omit TFA, you spend an entire movie following characters that you're going to handwave the arcs of in the next film. the only real defence i have is that i think TLJ is a better ending for Luke than RotJ, and a better ending for the ST characters than TROS offers. Kylo might be the exception here: his point of emotional turmoil at the end of TLJ isnt a phenomenal endpoint for the character, and his redemption is (imo) okay in IX, but in the case of Rey, Finn, and Poe, I think the arcs they get in their second outings are way better than what they get in IX.\n",

Overall I think its an ok/fine movie but my original criticisms remain. Is it basically a rehash of ANH, yea it is but I understand why they did it. It was a safe way to introduce the series after it had been dormant for 10 years. My biggest original criticism is I think Kylo Ren should have won the duel/ Rey just manages to escape. I think it made more sense logically for Kylo to win and I think it would have been more interesting for Rey as now she has a benchmark to overcome and we feel Kylo is more of a threat later on as Rey was unable to match him the first time. My other criticisms are just small nitpicks such as I think it was kinda stupid how Rey could use a Jedi mind trick but it doesn’t detract too much from the movie. Oh and the cinematography/lighting for Han and Kylos scene on the starkiller base, 11/10, fantastic. But how about you guys? Any opinions or thoughts change as you watched and rewatched 7? Anyone else agree Kylo should have won?\n",

      "Then, like in Rogue one, have some, of even all, of the protagonists killed by the hands of the Knights of Ren (or some Sith Eternals) which, from what I understood, according to the novelization of Rise of Skywalker were actually loyal to Palpatine all along.

      "My friend is a sequel lover and a prequel hater. Yes, we've talked about it. No, he won't denounce his crimes.  When asked about Rogue One, he said the beginning is slow and up until the third act he was disinterested.  It's a common thread I find with sequel lovers to say that a movie is boring or slow when trying to explain why they don't like the prequels/Rogue One.  How is it slow? Even if you don't get the amazingly deep and engaging plot, there's enough action to distract even the most \"flashy pictures\" kind of audience member. (One who only watches for the cool action or cgi and is otherwise disinterested in plot/cinematography/writing quality)  Rogue One is by far the best new age Star Wars movie ever to come.  Why? Because it honors the original work. Garreth Edwards didn't try to create a whole new Universe, like Rian Johnson says \"the rules of a Universe don't matter\".  Imagine if someone took Stan Lee's Marvel, and all of a sudden started taking away all the rules of his MCU, killing all of his characters, and blaming the fans if they didn't enjoy it.  It's disrespectful.  Respect the original work while also making a great plot, good action of course, a dedicated team of actors/crew, and you'll have a bomb-a$$ movie.  Great job, Edwards.  Screw you, Rian.\n",

Mind you I’m not talking about the lightsaber fights themselves whether you thought Yoda jumping around was goofy or not is subjective. I will concede as much as I liked Yoda fighting his former Padawan it would’ve made more sense (and be cooler) if Windu fought Dooku and saved Yoda fighting for Ep III since the only lightsaber fight we see Windu in is against Sidious which was relatively short and underwhelming \n",

First off ignoring in the prequels Yoda is 30 years younger and hasn’t been humbled like he was after the Clone Wars all Jedi use lightsabers. I’m sure there’s an exception in the EU but overlooking that using a lightsaber isn’t (or at least wasn’t) easy for regular people to do. Even in the EU and canon the few who can use a light saber profusely are typically incredibly trained warriors and use gadgets to help them like Boba Fett or Grevious. So clearly the force plays a part in mastering a lightsaber meaning they’re bound its like asking why Dumbledore needs a wand if he’s a powerful wizard\n",
      "\n",
      "Even putting that aside I don’t think the prequels assassinates his character and connection to the force. Both against Dooku and Sidious the fights begin with them flexing their abilities of the force. Dooku even says their knowledge of the force is equal and the only way to decide this contest is in a lightsaber duel and partway through the fight against Sidious both of them resort to using the force and throwing the pods around.

It makes the sequels the main story and all the other movies are flashbacks. The timestamps are for D+, but I dont think it makes much of a difference. I would LOVE suggestions on ways to make it better, or if this is just hot garbage. Thank you guys and May the Force be with you.\n",

Is there a chance it could happen? It would be switching between live action and animation throughout the movie. I think it would be sick and for someone binging the franchise for the first time in chronological order (Watching CW before episode 3) Watching the edit would be the perfect way to conclude the series without going out of the chronological order. What do you think?\n",

      "\n",
      "In real life, nobody is redeemed by someone outside of themselves. There's no one keeping score. Nobody is going to tell you you're officially a good person, now. If you've done wrong, you have to live with those consequences. You have to live with the damage you have done to your relationship with the world.  You can only choose what you are going to do now. You only redeem yourself to yourself by knowing what is in your heart and following that new sense of good by acting good.\n",

      "The force accepts Anakin into the light, because the force doesn't play by the morality of living beings.  The force doesn’t have emotions.  It doesn’t hold grudges. The force sees what's in a living being's heart, and that’s what matters.  It sees all the things we can't see. We can never see inside another being's heart. We can only piece it together from their actions. We may feel Vader is redeemed, because we see the force's acceptance, and therefore we see inside Vader's heart.  For that reason you could say he's redeemed.  I think there's plenty of valid reasons to believe he's is or isn't redeemed.  The most important thing for me is redemption isn’t really the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you see the ending through each Luke and Vader's point of view, you'll see the ending isn't about redemption, it's about their relationship.  Vader was transformed by Luke’s love and in turn acted out of love for Luke.  Everybody can love.  No matter how good or bad you are, you can feel and act out of love for someone.  Love doesn’t necessarily transform someone from bad to good.  What love can do is soften a heart.  It can transform the inhuman into human.  Vader was transformed from a monster to be feared into a flawed human to be pitied.  From Vader to Anakin.  In those final moments Luke gets to speak with Anakin, not the redeemed villain, but the flawed and complicated human and father that was lost inside his own darkness and unable to love anything but his own power.  The ending isn’t Vader saves Luke from the Emperor, but that Luke saves his father from Vader.  It’s something outside the bounds of labels like good and bad and into the transcendent.\n",

      "I was watching the clip where Mace Windu dies and all I could think while watching it is “yeah, he deserves to die!” He was ignoring Anakin telling him what he should have done, but he went to do it anyway! What! Also, Obi Wan is really rude in the prequels! Bruh! The dark side is more likeable than the Jedi! People who didn’t watch the originals would probably think the dark side were the protagonists since the Jedi are just doing whatever even if it’s not the Jedi way and just being rude as fuck!\n",

      "Since you guys liked the last one so much, Im posting another snippet for constructive critique. The scene in question takes place on one of the lowest levels of coruscant, as Kylo Ren desperately searches for something revealed to him in a sith holocron, something he believes will give him the edge he needs to with a galactic civil war and purge the galaxy of the jedi and their influence once and for all. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kylo and his men push onwards, before finally arriving at their destination. The structure they find is ancient, its entrance surrounded by pillars of blackened stone, carved with symbols that kylo cannot make out as being of jedi or sith origin. He feels a presence calling out to him, and he, flanked by his knights and inquisitors, proceed into the structure. They head down ancient corridors, the walls marked in a dead language and lightsaber marks from battles fought long ago. Finally, they enter a chamber that appears to be an amphitheater. \n",
      "\n",
      "At one end, there appears a figure, draped in shadows. The figures breathing is labored and mechanical. Kylo reaches out with the force, demands this specter reveal its identity. The figure turns, igniting a lightsaber as the red glow illuminates its face, revealing the mask of darth vader. This specter is clad in damaged armor, melted and twisted by fire. As it moves forward, the knights of ren take a defensive stance as kylo ignites his saber. He demands to know the specters true identity, that darth vader died on endor. The specter speaks in the voice of darth vader as it states that it is kylo’s undoing. It then advances, moving unnaturally swift as it cuts down one of kylos knights. They attempt to advance and encircle it, but they and the inquisitors are no match for a full sith lord. Kylo looks back to where they entered, but the entry way has been blocked by stone. He then turns to face his grandfather’s image, his knights and inquisitors laying dead upon the ground, some in more than one piece.\n",
      "\n",
      " Kylo takes up a defensive stance as he declares that he will not be defeated by a ghost, and that his grandfather was weak, beholden to his emotions and sentimentality. But vader counters that kylo ren is but a child in a mask, a failure. He then delivers a strong downward blow which kylo blocks, his own lightsaber pushed to within an inch of his face. Vader tells him that kylos attempts to complete his legacy are a folly, and that his failure to learn from vaders mistakes will be his doom. They continue to exchange blows, with kylo jumping backwards to gain distance. He attempts to use the force in anger, to hold back darth vader, but its of no use as darth vader advances, blade in hand. Realizing his death is close at hand, kylo attempts to strike out at his grandfather, but dath vader parries his blows until finally, they are locked in place as kylo attempts to hold off his grandfathers saber, the blade growing closer to his face. Out of moves, he quickly moves his head, turning off his lightsaber and dropping it from his hand, before grabbing it with his other and reigniting it aimed squarely at vaders chest. When kylo looks upon his opponent though, he no longer sees the specter of darth vader, but of Anakin skywalker.\"\n",

      "I think that Phasma was a criminally underused character in the sequels, and while additional materials like comics certainly expanded on her character, it's really a shame that she (at least according to people who worked on Episode 8) is dead. She was used for little more than gags and didn't get the imposing presence she should've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really would've liked to see an arc for her set after episode 8 (or even after episode 9) where she comes to realization with the fact that the First Order failed, and that what it stood for was evil. Perhaps there's still potential for something like this, since her death hasn't been confirmed in-universe (only by the actors).\n",

      "I just joined this sub a few hours ago. I’m sorry if I’m essentially reposting something that somebody else has already posted forever ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been rewatching the Star Wars movies throughout this coronavirus quarantine. I’m also a huge EU nerd. I’ve been thinking a lot about the prophecy revolving around Anakin. The prophecy of course is that Anakin Skywalker, the child with a midi-chlorian level surpassing even the most renowned Jedi and Sith in know history would bring complete balance to the force.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen tons of posts stating that Darth Vader killing the Emperor was the fulfillment of the prophecy. I’ve also seen posts that Luke Skywalker was the actual chosen one because he fulfilled his fathers destiny. I disagree with these theories. \n",
      "\n",
      "In RotS Obi-wan says, “You were meant to destroy the Sith, not join them.” In RotS yoda also mentions that the prophecy could have been misread. In EU the sith have a very similar prophecy about a very powerful dark side user who would destroy the Sith. This would allow the Sith order to be rebuild in a different, more productive way. Neither of these views reflect the prophecy as it is written.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prophecy clearly states that balance will be brought to the force. How can the force be balanced if either the light side or dark side has more control over the galaxy than the other? Either option is not a leveled playing field. The only way to bring balance to the force is to completely destroy both the Sith and the Jedi. I believe that the 3rd trilogy attempted to do this. Obviously the 3rd trilogy was a complete failure in this aspect as well as MANY others. \n",
      "\n",
      "The correct ending to the Saga was for Luke to find a balance between dark and light. The ability to harness both aggression and restraint would be the ultimate culmination of the force. I believe that Darth Vader came to this realization just before his death. He was defensive of his son and angry with the Emperor for attempting to supplant him, but at the same time he required calculated focus in order to cloud the Emperor’s mind from his true intentions. Think about how powerful Palpatine was. He was able to implant thoughts into other people’s heads in order to bend their will. He was also able to conceal his power from the entire Jedi Order. It would take complete balance to defeat a foe with such cunning and raw power. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prophecy was misread by the Jedi because it was clouded by their dogmatic view. This is why the Jedi failed. The Sith failed for the same exact reason. Instead of reading the prophecy with an open mind, they both attempted to bend the meaning of the prophecy to fit their own view of the galaxy. Without an all encompassing view of the force the Jedi and the Sith were doomed to repeat their cycle of destruction until the end of time.\n",

      "After seeing tros I felt there was a huge missed potential for the Knights. I do know why they werent included as much, but I still want to express my thoughts on a way they could have been included.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, during the opening scene with Kylo shredding through his enemies, the Knights could have been included accompanying him and tearing down ranks as well as showing each of their fighting styles. And no, I don't mean specifically showing each on individually I mean just a general wide shot of them going through combat, just a simple extra 45 seconds or something. I felt it would have showed the Knights level of threat and experience in addition to not taking up alot much screen time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few other scenes that could have been included is a brief encounter before Finn, Po, and Chewie get into the millennium falcon to rescue Rey. Example of how this scene might go: Finn is lagging behind as they run to the Falcon, out of nowhere Trudgen and Vicrul come out to try and re-capture him and they begin fighting, Finn using the same baton Phasma fought him with. Finn is clearly getting over powered by both Knights so Po comes to help after he orders chewie to start the falcon. Soon, reinforcements being filling the room as chewie begins firing at them using the falcons turret, the knights are winning but back off of the fight as chewie clears the first wave of reinforcements and begins aiming the turret at them. Po and Finn narrowly being their escape as the Knights begin firing their blasters at them. but as they do chewie aims and begins to fire, but both swiftly dodge and move to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel this would have displayed some more raw skill in battle, even besting main characters who would normally insta-win via plot armor while avoiding free kills that these main characters always get on enemy characters, hence chewie not being able to kill them with the turret.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last major fight that could have had more was Kylo vs the Knights. Before I get into it I feel a major plot that should have changed was Leia's death, I feel it should have happened during this scene, here's why. During the fight scene between Rey and Kylo Rey still stabs Kylo but instead she just force heals him and leaves instead of Leia dying halfway through. Instead, Kylo begins to feel the light side more, but still battles the dark as well. He still goes to Exogul, but hes kind of in between like a grey jedi for a while, Palpatine senses this and sends the knights to capture him since he is considered a non-sith, making him a lost cause in Palpatines eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fight would go something like this: The knights still beat the shit out of Kylo until Rey senses his struggle between Light and dark (More light than dark though) and gives him the lightsaber while speaking to him via the force. When he pulls out the light saber, the Knights instantly enter combat mode against him instead of standing around for 3 seconds like idiots. Ap'lek showcases his smoke here, casuing the area around kylo to be filled with smoke. As the  smoke surrounds him he begins using his force sense to try and find where the Knights are around him when blaster fire from Kuruk and Cardo come at Kylo. Kylo begins deflecting the shots then abruptly they stop as Trudgen, Ap'lek and Ushar emerge from the smoke to attack. A fight insues as they team up on Kylo. Kylo begins losing the fight as palpatine mentally torments him into returning to the dark, he offers to spare him (palpatine is lying to manipulate him). More smoke begins to cloud the area as they fight and now the Knights begin to try and trick Kylo by returning to the smoke. Out of the smoke comes a thick wall of flames from Cardo and Kylo backs up to only come in range of the other knights as one last fight insues. During the fight Leia notices Kylo's struggle and repeats what she did earlier, but instead it happens here. When she dies, Kylo feels the influence of the Lightside, and sends a massive force blast around him removing all the smoke and knocking the knights down, this is when he beings dispatching them. Kylo begins taking them out with ease, much like how Luke did in the comic but not as fast, he ultimately comes out more powerful and ready to kill palpatin in honor of what Leia just did for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know its a wall, but its been on my mind frequently and thought I would share, I know their might be a few issues plot wise when connecting it together with what the film is now, but just imagine this scene on its own, I feel it would be a more honorable death to them then what they got.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm sure this has been asked before but I can't for the life of me find answers online for some reason lmao. Feel free to link it if you have it. So! Empire and Rebellion, Republic and Separatists, Old Republic and Sith Empire, Resistance and First Order. Who was right in each case? I know the bad guys are designed to be bad, but if you really look at them everyone has a case to be right. Thoughts? We all have opinions but try and base this off of facts and not \"I loved the clones so the Republic is best,\" and stuff like that\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "In my opinion palpatine coming back as a cyborg with abilities like grievous would’ve been much more badass than the weird clone he came in. Could have helped kept him from being overpowered from his lightning but put a better emphasis on his light saber combat, which I wanted to see much more than the stereotypical lighting overpowering the hero like he did with literal all his other appearances. \n",

      "Yellow is the color of youth, creation, technology so Rey’s creation of her golden/yellow lightsaber on Tatooine in the final Skywalker Saga movie is a direct riff on Anakin’s creation of golden C-3PO and his yellow podracer on Tatooine in the first Skywalker Saga movie. Anakin has maintained his association with the color yellow with his use of the Naboo starfighter, the airspeeder in Attack of The Clones, and his Jedi starfighters in The Clone Wars and Revenge of The Sith. This was a severe sign of him not being able to mature because of the Jedi’s teachings that use reason to hold back his passions. Rey’s creation of a yellow lightsaber at the end of her journey is indicative of the renewal of a new childhood rather than a regression to it. She dies a Palpatine and retires her adulthood as she is reborn a Skywalker (via Ben Solo’s life force) and is given a new childhood. The final scene is her returning to a familiar home to honor the Skywalker legacy by burying the lightsabers and also to make peace with her own upbringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The green lightsaber represents the balance that’s holding passion (red) and reason (blue) in tension. Qui-Gon Jinn wielded a green lightsaber which represents his underlying dislike of the teachings of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker wielded a green lightsaber as he was tempted by both the light and dark sides. The yellow lightsaber represents the transcending of both the red and the blue. The red lightsaber, representative of the Sith, is cast into the sea. The blue lightsabers, representative of the Jedi, are buried underneath the surface of land. The yellow lightsaber is a symbol that represents the Skywalker family, a family known cheat the deaths of the ones they love by virtue of compassion and self-sacrifice.\n",

      "So how does time work? When they say a year, is it 365 days? Seems unlikely since that is Earth time. Wouldn't each planet have a different amount of days in a year? Not to mention a different amount of hours in a day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a Galactic standard year, like the standard language? Is 12 BBY 12 Earth years? Would seem to be a similar time frame since Solo takes place in 12 BBY and Rouge One takes place in 0 BBY. \n",

      "How many of y'all would have rather seen a Republic Commando series rather than The Mandalorian? Republic Commando is an excellent series of books that doesn't conflict with anything that is canon so Disney could make an exception for it and make it canon as well. It was actually unfinished because the author (Karen Traviss) was working on the 6th book when Disney bought Star Wars and made everything legends so she never finished the series which is slightly aggravating. A Republic Commando series would be soooo dope\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm CERTAIN I will eat my words if the rumors are true. I have complete faith in every hand guiding the show, but right now my anxiety is based around how much I'm loving the Mandalorian's ability to create fantastic new characters. A large part of the appeal is how the show creates brand new characters that feel right at home in Star Wars and (for me) immediately win me over. I don't want that incredible ability to be sidelined in favor of already-established fsn favorites popping up and taking most of the screentime. \n",

We're getting more films though, and I think whatever's next can be boiled down to 2 options: HR and direct continuation. Do they go w/ High Republic which distances us from IX time-wise and carves out a new era in Star Wars, with albeit,  more prequels, OR do they embrace IX's messiness and push the canon forward, which is giving us more of these characters who weren't served well by the ST? \n",

      "But I really hated TLJ. It seemed that Rian Johnson had never seen a Star Wars movie in his entire life. Everything from making it super political, to stopping heroic sacrifices, to skipping past subtle storylines, to altering everything we know about hyperspace, to Leia Poppins, TO MAKING LUKE (THE MAN WHO SAW GOOD IN THE MOST EVIL MAN IN THE UNIVERSE) SUDDENLY  BECOME AN EVIL IMPULSIVE OLD MAN WHO TRIES TO KILL A KID WHO HE GOT SCARED OF, and even to having Luke die off by a force power that is almost played off as easy. So much wrong with that movie. People didn’t appreciate the prequels as much as they do now when they were released, and I had very high hopes with the release of TFA (I even got totally sucked into the Rey Palpatine theory as it would be a very cool counter to the other six films (which also brings me back to TLJ having just saying “naw duck the main storyline and mystery” and having Rey’s parents be “nobody”) I could see objectively how it was enjoyable and introduced new and fun characters. I was especially stuck on the small hints of Finn later becoming a Jedi, or at least force sensitive (which was also ruined by Rian Johnson—who made him the “Ha ha XD funny token black guy”. Hell his first scene in the movie is “look how clumsy and stupid I am. Haha there’s water coming out of me isn’t that funny?”) which you can see JJ try to salvage in TRS. I was in the boat that everybody was hating on it because it was new and a soft reboot that we would all end up appreciating in another 20 years. And boy did that stop with TLJ. I still even tried to appreciate that movie, hell even though I hated the scene I was optimistic to explore a force sensitive Leia—RIP Carrie Fischer—but unfortunately that was out of anybody’s control. Crait was beautiful and I enjoyed Adam Driver. Speaking of Adam Driver—I thoroughly enjoyed him and his portrayal of Kyle Ren. I know a lot of people did not, but I thought it was perfect—a conflicted “wannabe Vader” who struggled to contain his emotions. I thought he was very intriguing and was excited to explore his backstory, until Rian came up with that excuse for and origin story. And I also enjoyed Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, John Boyega—the whole bunch. Really I could just see the sequels to turn out to be a beautiful thing that was just being hated on and was under-appreciated. And I strongly believe that this would have stuck through the whole trilogy, had it not been for Rian Johnson and the cesspool that’s is The Last Jedi. \n",

      "tl:dr If JJ had had full reigns (or nearly any director besides Rian Johnson) of the movies—especially TLJ than I believe that the sequels would eventually be remembered fondly, had a consistent and memorable storyline, and would have just been all around great Star Wars films (AKA super hyped for the recuts etc. 😃)\n",

He then lures Rey to Exegol to try to make her become not the new Sith apprentice, but the new Master.

Yoda talks about how arrogant young jedi have become in the prequels, and his force ghost talks about how it is time to move on from the old ways in the sequels.  But more to the point, we see Rey use the ability to transfer life to heal people instead of hurt them - this practice of any form was considered unnatural by the jedi order from as early as Ajunta Pall.  But Rey shows that no particular knolwedge is inherently evil, it's what you do with it.  The Jedi order had too much fear and pride, and embraced form over function, so I think part of Anakin's destiny of balancing the force was rebooting the jedi order.  Does that make sense?\n",

Since the release of Disney Plus I went on there to watch all the Star Wars movies in Order from 1 - 8. After watching the prequels I decided to research them a bit more and found out the prequels were hated for the actors who played Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). I understand why people found Jar Jar annoying but why Anakin? Specifically why Hayden? Do you hate the prequels and these actors? For me the prequels got more and more engaging as they became more action packed. The story of Anakin/Vader was interesting but also very sad. This made me particularly enjoy Revenge of the Sith.\n",

Did The Force Awakens only earn a lot in the Box Office since it was the first movie Star Wars movie since 2005, because it was the sequels, because it was made by Disney? Now I too have become interested in really wanting to know what George Lucas' plan for the sequels were. Do you think we will ever see them on the big screen?

      "So a popular complaint against TLJ is that Luke’s character was fucked with. And I honestly felt that way at first too as, just like many of you, I grew up with him as my hero and one of my favorite characters ever. However, as I’ve come to appreciate TLJ and the sequels more, I’ve started to change my mind on that. I’ve made posts in here defending Luke before and why I think his characterization made sense in TLJ, but that’s not even what I’m trying to argue here. I think the reason why he was “different” matters a lot more then how he was different. It seemed what Rian was trying to do with Luke was convey themes of failure and owning up to your own mistakes and that the past will always catch up to you. He was trying to show Luke in a way that we could all relate to. Basically, the reason why Luke was conveyed the way he was important to the story and helped showcase some important themes and messages that stuck with me and a lot of other people. So I may never be able to convince someone that Luke was portrayed fairly, but I think the reason why he was portrayed the way he was is important, which I think matters a lot more then how he ended up acted the way he did. \n",

      "I know that this is a pretty common realization/sentiment, but I just wanted to share my personal moment of realization with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was rewatching the prequels recently and there are two moments that particularly illustrate how the Jedi had become blinded by their own hubris. The first occurs in Episode 1, when Mace Windu and Yoda are discussing the idea that the Sith may have Rosen again and are growing in power. Mace Windy's blind moment of pride is more subtle than the next example, but he States that he does not believe the Sith could have returned without the Jedi being aware of it. This implies that he believes the Jedi are too powerful/observant to have allowed this to slip by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in Episode 2 when Obi-Wan goes looking for Kamino, he searches the archives and speaks with a archivist about his confusion with the missing system and his belief that the records are incomplete. Now Obi-Wan has already earned a certain amount of respect and awareness for who he is within the order. But not only does the archivist dismiss the possibility that the records could be incomplete, she gets rather offended by it and states absolutely that \"if there is no record of something within our archives, then it does not exist\". Seeing this scene as a kid I just thought she was supposed to be some snooty librarian stereotype and that was that. But it is a prime example not only of the toxic hubris of the Jedi, but also how their attitudes have led them to stray towards the dark side unwittingly. For \"only a Sith deals in absolutes\", so no matter how outlandish a concept it may be, the archivist should have at least acknowledged the possibility that the archives could be missing some information if she was truly operating by the philosophy of the Jedi.\n",

      "      The Sequel Trilogy has many flaws, and the two that stick out are how the movies do not flow together as a trilogy as the OT and (sort of) the PT did, and TFA set up many questions, (who is Snoke, Rey’s parents, Luke’s status, among others) and TLJ seemed to have written it all off. Snoke was killed and did not have the role we thought he would in this trilogy, Rey came from nothing, and Luke was in fear after his failure w/ Ben. As much as we all criticized this, following the setups of TFA through the trilogy would have increased the fluidity of the story, yet (in my opinion) left a somewhat stale, similar rendition of the OT. If we take the twists and turns of TLJ and look at them in a positive light, they were trying to push the ST into a new story where there was not an overarching, orchestral villain, a main hero derived from power, and a mentor that had their weaknesses and needed guidance themselves. The third movie would’ve shown Kylo Ren as he faces is actions and must decide where his destiny lies, and Rey, who must  earn her place in the saga. Opinions on what could’ve fixed the ST and whether TLJ or RoS should have differed, and why? Obviously these movies were janky af, but I’d love to hear other input.\n",

The Last Jedi (BY ITSELF) was a great movie, but Rian Johnson didn't give two shits about Star Wars lore and he basically threw out a lot of what JJ Abrams set up in The Force Awakens.. he rebooted the reboot.

Then after the controversy that followed, JJ Abrams releases a fan service mess that was just trying to clean up after The Last Jedi. Kennedy is responsible for all of this. She should be guiding the stories, and should have taken greater control over the scripts. The crazy part is she DID step in on Solo and Episode IX by firing the directors because they \"didn't fit the Star Wars brand,\" but I cant for the life of me understand what she was talking about! Colin Treverow's leaked script was so much better the The Rise of Skywalker, and it didn't throw out the good parts of the Last Jedi.

How did ground forces go from mostly normal people, in a world war 1 kind of battle, to only storm troopers in episode 4? There isn't that much time between them. Then the original trilogy only has stormtroopers (I think) which are all clones, then in the newer trilogy they aren't clones any more, but are still dressed as storm troopers? Why aren't they dressed in normal military attire in the new trilogy?  \n",

      "On the internet all the time when people talk about sequels they hate on it so much. I am here to convince you that sequels are the best star wars trilogy. Let's talk about the story, because it's the most important aspect of movies (at least I think so). In sequels we met a troubled scavenger - Rey - that cannot find her place in the world until she finds a ressistance droid BB8 and \"ressistance spy\" Finn (or so she thought). Finn himself was a stormtrooper not being able to see his friends suffer so he finally snaps and frees Poe Dameron (that goes missing after that). He doesn't really know who to trust, but he needs to eventually rely on Rey. Together they try to deliver the droid back to ressistance. Before it happens Rey gets captured by Kylo Ren and therefore Finn \"loses\" another important person in his life. At least he finds his old friend Poe. In pursuit of our female scavenger Finn together with Han and Chewbacca fly to the Starkiller Base. They find Rey but then Han that dies in the hands of his son - Ben Solo also known as Kylo Ren. Eventually Finn tries to fight Ben but gets damaged. Now this is a part that people get angry about. Rey with the use of a lightsaber and the force defeats Kylo even tough she didn't ever showcase such abilities. Because of it she is considered a Mary Sue, but she gives people hope. She is really the same as Super Man. She is the daughter of Palpatine and so she deserves such power. Then Starkiller Base gets destroyed and ressistance completes the map to Luke Skywalker. Rey travels to him and the great Jedi Master suposedly isn't behaving like he should. But he behaves exactly like Yoda. He goes into exile when he's needed. He doesn't want to help, but a friend of his tells him that he should do it. He teaches the new Jedi recruit of the ways of the force, even tough there are doubts coming out of this Jedi's past (not really known at this point with Rey). Then this Jedi needs to fly to the rescue of their friends. Exactly the same. He tries to do it to much as it may be visible. Prequels tried to do something new that didn't really succed. Sequels deliver recreation of original trilogy a lot better than ever with fixes to the story of original trilogy and significantly special effects.\n",
      "\n",

      "So I think the biggest reason for the divide in the fan base with Rey and whether or not she should have to be somebody is because TFA did such a poor job of making its own characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the rehashed planets (Jakku=Tattoine, Starkiller base=Hoth, Takodana=Endor) to a rehashed Cantina to Maz being a pseudo Yoda, the biggest thing they did was set up Rey with all of Anakin and Luke’s attributes.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Something I haven’t seen discussed as much is the drastic difference between the fighting styles of Kylo Ren and the redeemed Ben Solo. Rewatching the KoR battle we see Ben implementing a more fluid ,graceful ,fighting style , opposite to the feral , brutal  blade work of Kylo Ren . I think the difference  is both indicative of the very distinct personas of Ben and Kylo informing their blade work and the idolization of the equally ( if not more so) distinct personalities of the grandfather that inspired him.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Kylo  Ren’s style of fighting was in my own view ,very reminiscent of Vader but there is a distinction that puts Vader above Ren and . Vader religiously applies powerful strikes filled with savagery , yet it was focus that truly made Vader a dangerous duelist. The Dark One interchangeably employ raged filled barrages and clinical , calculated blade work . Ren due to his erratic nature cannot employ this and so he gets carried away and rages , thus adopting a poor approximation of Vader that lacks in finesse.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ben on the other hand, moves similar to a prequel era Jedi, twirling saber and fancy blocks ,fighting as if a weight had lifted off of his shoulders. Solo moved with a fluidity and confidence  that was a delight to watch . It was very Anakin-esque, in the way that he moved ,powerful  in the sense that you could feel the strength of his blows but still containing a grace to temper it.  I just wish we got to see more  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So Anakin is the chosen one who is supposed to return balance to the force. He does this as Darth Vader when he kills Palpatine/Sidious. Kylo Ren and Snoke aren't Sith. Snoke just used the dark side and Kylo Ren uses the dark side and is a Knight of Ren. But in The Rise of Skywalker (this isn't just another thread hating on The Rise of Skywalker) when Palpatine returns, that basically breaks the prophecy that Anakin, the chosen one, kills the Sith. So could it be that Rey is also part of that prophecy? Or should the Palpatine part of TROS be different?\n",

As far as I know you can’t do a mind trick to a droid. That’s why I believe he did a similar trick to the Mandalorian. Instead of waving his hand “The Child “ used his baby cute looks!

      "I posted this once when the Blu-ray came out, paraphrasing the quote, but here's the exact quote from the featurette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the first trilogy, the hardest thing Luke could be told in that moment was that Vader was his father. It turns everything on its head for Luke, it takes away all the easy answers and make him face the hardest thing, which is that ‘I no longer have just a bad guy I can hate; suddenly the thing that I thought was the bad guy’s actually a part of me.’ For Rey, I think it's the exact opposite. If she were told that she's related to this person or Luke is her this or whatever, that would be the easiest thing she could hear, that’s everything she wants, that would instantly define what her place is in this universe. So to me, the equivalent of ‘I am your father’ is ‘Nope you gotta stand on your own two feet, there are not going to be those easy answers here for you. You're wondering who you are? Okay, well you have to find out who you are for yourself.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching this featurette back in 2018, it really set into my mind the brilliance of Rey being a nobody. In all fairness though, finding out Palpatine is your grandpa isn't an easy answer, but as far as a story line goes I think Rian had it right. After a trilogy of Luke being born into this family and being the only one who could save Darth Vader, and a trilogy of Anakin being the Chosen One, I was very excited to have the antagonist be predestined into an inclination for the Dark Side while the protagonist made their own path. I will always mourn the loss of Rian's greatest contribution to the sequel trilogy.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Lately, the Star Wars movies have been, to put it mildly, a bit uninspired. Rebels vs Empire, Jedi vs Sith, occasionally a Death Star thrown in the mix, often with classic OT characters in major roles. (That's not to say they're all bad... They're just not really treading new ground for the franchise.) And a lot of fan suggestions tend to follow the same patterns, with the addition of Legends adaptions thrown into the mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, I wanted to hear the community's most creative and outside-the-box ideas for Star Wars films.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple examples of my own:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Elderblade**  \n",
      "The Jedi believed that every Kyber Crystal was alive. Some more than others. Long ago, a Jedi Master sought eternal life and stored his consciousness within a crystal. A young man who is strong in the Force but undisciplined finds himself drawn to a mysterious relic. A lightsaber from ages past. Through this saber, the ancient being within can guide its wielder, and the wielder can even channel the skills and abilities of the crystal within as if they were their own. But there are others who seek the Blade as well, who will stop at nothing to obtain its powers. And as the boy channels more of the Jedi's abilities, he begins to question who is really in control, and if the master within has an agenda of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Droidmaker's Daughter**  \n",
      "The Force flows through all living things. After the Clone Wars, droids were hated and reviled through much of the Galaxy. The Empire forbid advancements in droid technology, and the New Republic carried over many of these restrictions. But not everyone shares these prejudices. A lonely Droidmaker lives within the far reaches of the Outer Rim, far away from the rest of the Galaxy, with only his Droids to keep him company, conducting experiments that many would consider unnatural. However, his Droids are no substitute for actual human contact, and he wants nothing more than to have a child of his own. Defying every law and regulation, the Droidmaker creates his greatest masterpiece. A daughter crafted of metal on the inside, but appearing human on the outside, who can learn and grow as a person. And even, most frighteningly, access the Force itself. A true living Droid. But when word of her father's experiments reaches the world beyond, she has to run and hide within a galaxy that would hate and fear her if it knew what she really was. A galaxy which her very existence could forever alter.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Jedis are supposed to be special because the force lets them slow their perception of time right? That’s why they can fight the way they do and why non jedis are generally not a threat to them unless in great numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you have this random guy who can’t use the force but is able to kill several jedis in duels. I don’t think him having multiple arms/sabers has anything to do with it because 1) he didn’t start out with 4 lightsabers he started with 1 and got more as he killed more Jedi and 2) I don’t see how a four limbed enemy would make much of a difference to Jedi who can deflect laser blasts coming from all directions with seemingly no trouble unless they are caught off guard (like during order 66).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I watched TLJ again the other day. Afterwards I realized that the lesson he learned in ROTJ is the same as in tlj. So Luke realizes that he should not follow the Jedi code 100%, and that’s how he was able to redeem his father. He was going to rebuild a new Jedi order. In tlj, he abandons his attachment to Kyle for a split second, and has a fleeting thought of killing him. This obviously was a mistake, but he already learned not to do that. If you say that he was letting his fear guide him instead, then he just forgot his training for no reason. By the end he thinks someone should rebuild the Jedi order, even thought that’s what he was already supposed to do!? Am I looking at this wrong?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I would definitely say yes. Andy Circus brought so much to the character, and I think he would’ve made an awesome main villain for the trilogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian McDiarmid stole the show every time he was on screen, so I was happy to see Palpatine again. The problem was *how* they explained his return and that it wasn’t foreshadowed at all. The only subtle hint I can remember, is in TLJ when I heard Palpatine’s theme at some point. I can’t remember when that was, but I know I heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snoke could’ve easily been written back into TROS. Maybe cloning force sensitive beings was his discovery, and that’s why he was able to live. It also would’ve made killing him and destroying Exogol way more important. \n",
      "\n",
      "**THE NEW PLOT**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here could’ve been an interesting plot. Snoke wants to create a pair of powerful force sensitive apprentices, but he needs Rey and Kylo on Exegol to do it. To do that, he bridges their minds again so that they come together to destroy him. So the first act is to establish Snoke’s goal on Exegol, and show what Rey and Kylo have been up to and bridge their minds for the first time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second act would be them both hunting for the one Sith Wayfinder at the same time to find Snoke. Rey brings Poe, Finn, Chewie and Threepio to help her. When they find it, the same thing happens then when they fought on the Death Star wreckage. Rey stabs Ben and Leia gives up her life to save Ben Solo. Rey and the rest of her buddies separate, so her and Ben travel to Exegol to face Snoke. \n",
      "\n",
      "The third act plays out decently similarly from the movie, except that Rey and Ben go in together and fight off Snoke together. Poe and Finn are tasked with stealing a First Order Dreadnought or one of those planet killing star destroyer things to destroy Exegol with. They win the day, Exegol is destroyed, and Ben and Rey both survive. They split up since the Resistance would probably hang Ben, but they meet up in the future on Tatooine to bury Luke and Leia’s sabers. They stare off into the binary sunset and boom, movie over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this would’ve been way clearer and less disgusting lore-wise than what we got. Rey is still a nobody, but she becomes a Skywalker when she hooks up with Rey. Finn and Poe get something cool to do by stealing a Dreadnought, and we don’t have to bring back any dead characters besides Snoke.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I'm almost finished with ROTS novelization and honestly, it's an amazing book. Never read another Star Wars book (since I was like, 10, anyways) and it was phenomenal. However, I just finished the end of the Obi-Wan/Anakin &amp; Yoda/Sidious fights, and goodness those were some of the shortest, most rushed through fights I've read through in a book. Especially when compared to the opening fight with Dooku - am I missing something? Is there some nuance I am failing to get? It just feels so half-assed in what is otherwise an amazing read, I feel like I'm just straight up missing something I shouldn't be.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There's been a lot said about this scene but the most prevalent from one side seems to be that because Luke already 'had' his character development in ROTJ by saving Vader, and that's negated and inconsistent with his actions in TLJ in trying to kill Kylo. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always from day one interpreted it as even peak Luke as a Jedi Master, having experienced his trials and tribulations in the OT and more, was shaken to the core by what he saw in Ben - enough so that the only rational ultimatum was to kill him. He even states that the darkness growing in Ben was no match for him which justifies his lapse in judgement and blatant panic. A mistake that was momentous enough for him to self-impose himself until he was found by Rey. Was that not the case?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I got around to watching all 6 seasons of The Clone Wars  in order to start watching the 7th one, and really loved the whole series (and really enjoying the new season). I then started watching Rebels with not very high expectations since looking at the different style made me think it was going  to be quite inferior to the Clone Wars... not only I was proven wrong, but I just finished watching the 2nd season and oh man, that season finale was amazing! Really looking forward to the other 2 seasons and I can only hope Resistance is at least nearly as good as the other two series...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "CG have clearly caised a massive disruption in the community with these Galactic Legends. They hyped up a pathetic event that brought us stupidly powerful characters that undermined every team in the game. Not only does it put our commitment down the drain, but its ultimately shown that they've wasted their time and money on all the other characters and teams!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from this, very few people were fussed about getting a GL Rey and Kylo. It is sadly sort of protocal for a gane like SWGOH to realease content on the new movies. Yet, they don't seem to want to release content on the new TV shows. The Mandalorian for example has been extremely successful and came out way before TROS. They would have made a truck load of money from the community because everyone loves the mandalorian and probably would have gaimed a little more respect from the community. Instead, they released unwanted content that proved nothing else exclet the fact that they do not listen to their community and are frankly incredibly lazy.\n",
      "\n",

      " I hope we're all well aware that Maul survived. And I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that Obi-Wan cut him where his intestines are. Not to mention that he no longer has genitalia. So, how does he live without vital organs? Sorry for the gross questions, but I've always wondered this ever since I found out that he was alive. I know that zabarks aren't exactly humans, but one would assume that the large majority of alien species share the same - if not, very similar - anatomy to humans.\n",

      "I'm posting this here because i figure somebody out there knows exactly what I'm asking about. Back in 2012/2013 there was an online Lego Star Wars game I would play with my brother a TON. I remember there being a lot of ads for Lego Star Wars 3 on billboards and different places throughout the game. I don't remember a whole lot about it, but there was a \"PVP\" element to it. Two teams, red and blue, would be chosen and you would have to fight other player to get brick from them. You would then navigate up to the top of a tower with your brick and place it on a flag thingy. The first team to build the flag on top of their base would win. It was a 2-d side-scroller and you could use a bunch of different characters and weapons. It was really fun and I was wondering if anyone knew what the game was called, where I could find information about it, and if it's still accessible in some way. Thanks!\n",

To me he was the only person who actually tried to push Star Wars in a forward direction instead of clinging desperately to the past and nostalgia. In my opinion one of the best scenes from the entire trilogy was at the end of TLJ when Kylo Ren said \"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It's the only way to become who you were meant to be.\" I believe he was being kinda meta as well about the Star Wars franchise as a whole. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I believe The Last Jedi was the only movie to actually use some of the ideas George Lucas (or Lucasfilms) originally had for a sequel trilogy before Lucasfilms was bought by Disney. I'm not saying The Last Jedi isn't without it's flaws but honestly it's the only movie of the sequel trilogy that I'll be rewatching anymore.

      "1: His fighting style. While Palpy wanted to corrupt Anakin to replace Dooku, Dooku wanted Obi-Wan as his own apprentice. As to why? Dooku, as seen in TCW when he ridicules Savage and in the mini-series with Grievous, prefers refinement, control and precision over raw ability since he's a master of form 2. Which means Anakin was not the ideal apprentice for him as we see his dueling abilities are very good but still sloppy. Dooku would prefer Kenobi, who mastered the MOST controlled fighting style. In RotS, most people say Anakin should have won, but someone like Dooku looks at it and says, \"Of course Kenobi won, he was fighting smart while Skywalker was sloppy and out of control.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2: How their fighting styles compared to Palpy's. I think Palpy was a master or form 6, which is weak against 2, the style Dooku used. Kenobi used form 3, which is strong against every form. Compare that to Maul and Savage, who both use 7, which is weak against 6. Maul and Savage obviously lost, but did respectably. Kenobi and Dooku together might have stood a better chance than them and maybe better than Anakin and Dooku.\n",
      "\n",
      "3: His ability. I've already says Dooku prefers refinement over raw strength. But Kenobi has both, and Dooku knows he chopped Maul in half. At that point he'd heard of Anakin, but he'd never chopped a Sith in half.\n",
      "\n",
      "4: Okay, this actually does have something to do with Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon wasn't as straight-edged as other Jedi, and Kenobi was his apprentice, so it would be safe to assume Kenobi was the same (the assumption was mostly incorrect, but it was a safe guess)\n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

I've been working off of one of the posts here that lays out the episodes in chronological order, but it is about a year old and therefore ends at the end of S6. All i know is that the thumbnail for the series has a more adult ahsoka, and am wondering if that means it takes place after Episode III. If someone could either confirm that S7 is chronologically before Episode III, or if not tell me the order events occur, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!   \n",

For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).\\n\\n\\nAnyway, given the current quarantine has left me with extra time, I would love to branch out and explore Star Trek. I remember for a short bit in middle school I was into TNG and did like it and have seen JJ's movies. What are some good places to start, as well as some general facts about the Star Trek universe, it's characters, conflicts, eras etc.   \n",

My aim is to create a small system with a speaker on each side, and a button on each side. But i cant for the life of me, figure out the chime tones and make it sound right. If anyone has any ideas as to how to figure this out, let me know. I could get a SDcard hat, but that would be an extra 30-40 bucks just because of a simple tone sequence that i cant figure out, not to mention that would add complexity and size to the design.   \n",

First, I love vicariously re-living my first watching through my friend.  It's such a job.  We just came to the episode Sacrifice of Angels and he commented how anti-climactic the scene was where the prophets eliminate the Dominion fleet and I recalled that I thought the same way when the episode was aired years and years ago.  He asked me: \"what happened to them?\" And \"oh wait, don't tell me, I guess we'll find out in a future episode.\"  I told him, \"nah.  That's it, the god-like Prophets wiped them out,\" and he replied \"oh.\"    \\n\\n\\nMaybe it would have been better to show the wormhole energies going nuts and then slicing through and destroying the Dominion ships.  Something more definitive.  I know it would have been expensive in an already expensive ep, but it would have been more...satisfying?   \n",
       "3    It cost $70,000 per episode of TNG to remaster. This was almost ten years ago. They have made a ton of money with rerun TV deals and much more with streaming. This is cost effective, since HD is more preferable and has an easier sell through. With inflation, and more needed CGI needed let's say each episode of DS9 would now cost $200,000.\\n\\nThat's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).\\n\\nEven Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.\\n\\nThen there's CBS all access, who is now paying a lot of money for new Star Trek content with partner deals (Disco, Netflix, and Picard, Amazon). Even they could afford this to entice new subscribers. Something that didn'...   \n",

The helm officers are the most visible example of redshirts, other than the captain and first officer. But we see loads of redshirts roaming the halls of the Enterprise-D all the time. What do they do all day? Just continuously study how to command and practice battle simulations? Do Picard or Riker teach courses when they're not on the bridge? There can't be more than a handful of helm officers on a ship the size of the Ent-D, rotating shifts as required.   \n",

I am rewatching all the Clone Wars animated series on D+ along with the movies and Mandalorian, and I am wondering where s7 of the clone wars fits in via the timeline. I've been working off of one of the posts here that lays out the episodes in chronological order, but it is about a year old and therefore ends at the end of S6. All i know is that the thumbnail for the series has a more adult ahsoka, and am wondering if that means it takes place after Episode III. If someone could either confirm that S7 is chronologically before Episode III, or if not tell me the order events occur, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!   \n",

For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).\\n\\n\\nAnyway, given the current quarantine has left me with extra time, I would love to branch out and explore Star Trek. I remember for a short bit in middle school I was into TNG and did like it and have seen JJ's movies. What are some good places to start, as well as some general facts about the Star Trek universe, it's characters, conflicts, eras etc.   \n",

My aim is to create a small system with a speaker on each side, and a button on each side. But i cant for the life of me, figure out the chime tones and make it sound right. If anyone has any ideas as to how to figure this out, let me know. I could get a SDcard hat, but that would be an extra 30-40 bucks just because of a simple tone sequence that i cant figure out, not to mention that would add complexity and size to the design.   \n",

First, I love vicariously re-living my first watching through my friend.  It's such a job.  We just came to the episode Sacrifice of Angels and he commented how anti-climactic the scene was where the prophets eliminate the Dominion fleet and I recalled that I thought the same way when the episode was aired years and years ago.  He asked me: \"what happened to them?\" And \"oh wait, don't tell me, I guess we'll find out in a future episode.\"  I told him, \"nah.  That's it, the god-like Prophets wiped them out,\" and he replied \"oh.\"    \\n\\n\\nMaybe it would have been better to show the wormhole energies going nuts and then slicing through and destroying the Dominion ships.  Something more definitive.  I know it would have been expensive in an already expensive ep, but it would have been more...satisfying?   \n",
       "3  It cost $70,000 per episode of TNG to remaster. This was almost ten years ago. They have made a ton of money with rerun TV deals and much more with streaming. This is cost effective, since HD is more preferable and has an easier sell through. With inflation, and more needed CGI needed let's say each episode of DS9 would now cost $200,000.\\n\\nThat's $35.2 million for all 176 episodes. The entire series. These days that kind of money will get you three episodes of new TV, or one low budget movie. With DS9 in HD, it would be able to sell for the next 50 years. So this would be a worth it venture (Dare I say trek?).\\n\\nEven Netflix would do this if asked, as long as they had a two year exclusive window. Again for something that will last a very long time, worth it.\\n\\nThen there's CBS all access, who is now paying a lot of money for new Star Trek content with partner deals (Disco, Netflix, and Picard, Amazon).

The helm officers are the most visible example of redshirts, other than the captain and first officer. But we see loads of redshirts roaming the halls of the Enterprise-D all the time. What do they do all day? Just continuously study how to command and practice battle simulations? Do Picard or Riker teach courses when they're not on the bridge? There can't be more than a handful of helm officers on a ship the size of the Ent-D, rotating shifts as required.   \n",

However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\".

You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?   \n",
       "1    It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to wa...   \n",
       "2    I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. \\n\\n• It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.\\n\\n• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. \\n\\n• You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. Y...   \n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

Before the sequel trilogy Luke turned Vader back to the light side and he threw Palpatine off the death star. Well... He eventually comes back which makes that whole thing useless as Vader could have done that himself. \\n\\nLuke was also supposed to rebuild the Jedi Order. Which got destroyed again... Now that's Rey's responsibility to rebuild, because Luke died. \\n\\nAlso in Star Wars Theory's new video. He said Leia is more powerful than Luke if she trained to be a Jedi. Which makes his purpose in Star Wars lower.\\n\\nSo I want to know what you guys think is Luke's purpose? I have no idea as his character is kind of ruined now.   \n",

I am rewatching all the Clone Wars animated series on D+ along with the movies and Mandalorian, and I am wondering where s7 of the clone wars fits in via the timeline. I've been working off of one of the posts here that lays out the episodes in chronological order, but it is about a year old and therefore ends at the end of S6. All i know is that the thumbnail for the series has a more adult ahsoka, and am wondering if that means it takes place after Episode III. If someone could either confirm that S7 is chronologically before Episode III, or if not tell me the order events occur, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!   \n",

For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).\\n\\n\\nAnyway, given the current quarantine has left me with extra time, I would love to branch out and explore Star Trek. I remember for a short bit in middle school I was into TNG and did like it and have seen JJ's movies. What are some good places to start, as well as some general facts about the Star Trek universe, it's characters, conflicts, eras etc.</td>\n",

       "519  So I was a defender of this show earlier on. I saw some flaws with it but I also saw it’s potential. As time has gone on I feel like that it’s been slipping more and more into being a disappointment. Now I know that there will be those who disagree with me and I welcome their thoughts. If anyone has opinions that makes more sense of things then awesome. I know some of these posts get a little heated so I just wanted to try to welcome open and civil dialogue up front. Anyways here are some of my criticisms on episode 9. \\n\\nI’m having trouble with this new Soong. The entire reasoning for Nooniens devotion to the creation of Data and his brothers was to combine his passion for developing synthetic life and his need for having children. He even referred to Data as his son. It was even established that he was unable to have children with Datas mother Juliana. So the only way that this could make sense is if Noonien had a son with a woman before Juliana and they had a falling out. That...   \n",

She puts a lot of thought and passion into her acting!       \\n\\nI love Wil and how passionate and open he is about being a huge nerd, love you Wil! But damn that was a good interview. I usually feel like younger actors just kind of wing things and focus on themselves, but Isa was totally into it. And her acting as Sutra was really intense.      \\n\\nI like seeing people seriously passionate about their careers. She went way beyond just \"I'm making it up as I go along\" and really put serious thought into it, to the point she could have a fun and energetic conversation with Wil about her acting. And we know he takes his roles really serious and totally nerds out on them. Major props?   \n",

You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?   \n",
       "1    It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to wa...   \n",
       "2    I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. \\n\\n• It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.\\n\\n• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. \\n\\n• You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. Y...   \n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

Before the sequel trilogy Luke turned Vader back to the light side and he threw Palpatine off the death star. Well... He eventually comes back which makes that whole thing useless as Vader could have done that himself. \\n\\nLuke was also supposed to rebuild the Jedi Order. Which got destroyed again... Now that's Rey's responsibility to rebuild, because Luke died. \\n\\nAlso in Star Wars Theory's new video. He said Leia is more powerful than Luke if she trained to be a Jedi. Which makes his purpose in Star Wars lower.\\n\\nSo I want to know what you guys think is Luke's purpose? I have no idea as his character is kind of ruined now.   \n",

I am rewatching all the Clone Wars animated series on D+ along with the movies and Mandalorian, and I am wondering where s7 of the clone wars fits in via the timeline. I've been working off of one of the posts here that lays out the episodes in chronological order, but it is about a year old and therefore ends at the end of S6. All i know is that the thumbnail for the series has a more adult ahsoka, and am wondering if that means it takes place after Episode III. If someone could either confirm that S7 is chronologically before Episode III, or if not tell me the order events occur, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!   \n",

For me, Star Wars is definitely more of a simple good versus evil adventure story than being the thought provoking social commentary Star Trek is, but still has it's own interesting themes and elements that I think can be applied to life(mysticism of the Force, redemption and sacrifice, confronting inner demons) and there was Palpatine's political machinations to create a dictatorship. The franchise actually inspired my interest in Easter spirituality, given the Jedi are basically space Buddhist(Yoda's ''do or do not'' is like a Zen koan).\\n\\n\\nAnyway, given the current quarantine has left me with extra time, I would love to branch out and explore Star Trek. I remember for a short bit in middle school I was into TNG and did like it and have seen JJ's movies. What are some good places to start, as well as some general facts about the Star Trek universe, it's characters, conflicts, eras etc.</td>\n",

However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\".

       "1     It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to wa...   \n",
       "2     I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. \\n\\n• It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.\\n\\n• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. \\n\\n• You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. Y...   \n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

       "1020  First, before people think I'm going to baselessly slag off the show, know that I enjoy aspects of it and wholesale like it more than Discovery. There are some foundational things that irk me, however.\\n\\nAssuming next week ends with a big space battle (much like Disco S2) rather than a more discursive one, it leaves me wondering where the contemplative format went off course. But then, I'm more inclined to look at the background of the thing, and the 'presumptions' that underlie the show as a whole.\\n\\nRomulus' star goes supernova without warning. Romulans, being a species so enmeshed in science (and deviousness) would be able to detect if something were naturally wrong with their star. Being it was sudden, it was likely an artificial reason for its supernova. The first thought they'd likely have is that it's a Federation plot to destabilise the empire, which isn't unreasonable.

       "1021  So I was a defender of this show earlier on. I saw some flaws with it but I also saw it’s potential. As time has gone on I feel like that it’s been slipping more and more into being a disappointment. Now I know that there will be those who disagree with me and I welcome their thoughts. If anyone has opinions that makes more sense of things then awesome. I know some of these posts get a little heated so I just wanted to try to welcome open and civil dialogue up front. Anyways here are some of my criticisms on episode 9. \\n\\nI’m having trouble with this new Soong. The entire reasoning for Nooniens devotion to the creation of Data and his brothers was to combine his passion for developing synthetic life and his need for having children. He even referred to Data as his son. It was even established that he was unable to have children with Datas mother Juliana. So the only way that this could make sense is if Noonien had a son with a woman before Juliana and they had a falling out. That...   \n",

I usually feel like younger actors just kind of wing things and focus on themselves, but Isa was totally into it. And her acting as Sutra was really intense.      \\n\\nI like seeing people seriously passionate about their careers. She went way beyond just \"I'm making it up as I go along\" and really put serious thought into it, to the point she could have a fun and energetic conversation with Wil about her acting. And we know he takes his roles really serious and totally nerds out on them. Major props?   \n",

They're not a diaspora, but mainly stick to their own planets and their own ships, only venturing out to trade.\\n\\nUnless there's something I'm forgetting, the most often emphasized way in which they are dishonest and exploitative in their dealings isn't usury, it's that they seek trades that are unbalanced in their favor.

And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

      "In my opinion, with no death threats wanted. I believe Disney saved Star Wars. I love ROTS, but I think George Lucas did not have interest in Episodes 1 and 2, he just wanted ROTS to be made. Which did work out for that movie. But the sequel trilogy has been very good in my opinion. (Nothing like the originals of course.) 7 is great, 8 is probably the most okay you can get, and I really loved 9. I also think it's much easier to be a Star Wars fan now with all the games, shows, and even spin off movies.

He’s always  getting turned down and yelled at by the ladies. 3. Reunion with his friend, Hugh. 4. No real command experience or command needed, just asking to go places. He could have had a reunion with his Romulan buddy he was stuck in a hole with in TNG. 5. Would have a good/interesting backstory with Romulans that turned him into a Manchurian candidate. 6. Dealing with Data’s Daughter and throwing ideas off Soong/seeing his best friend one last time. 7. It just fits so much more and would have been more fitting for a Geordi adventure than Picard.\n",

There is around 4 weeks in a month and with Disney+ at 6.99$ per month, so 10 months to release every episodes. If one fan keeps his subscribtion to Disney+ for this amount of time : 69,9$.I don't know how many Clone Wars fans are subscribe to Disney+ but let's be humble and say 10 millions : 10 millions x 69,9 = 699 millions $.If it's 20 millions fans : 1,398 billion $.I think everyone could be happy with more episodes after season 7.\n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

       "1020  First, before people think I'm going to baselessly slag off the show, know that I enjoy aspects of it and wholesale like it more than Discovery. There are some foundational things that irk me, however.Assuming next week ends with a big space battle (much like Disco S2) rather than a more discursive one, it leaves me wondering where the contemplative format went off course. But then, I'm more inclined to look at the background of the thing, and the 'presumptions' that underlie the show as a whole.Romulus' star goes supernova without warning. Romulans, being a species so enmeshed in science (and deviousness) would be able to detect if something were naturally wrong with their star. Being it was sudden, it was likely an artificial reason for its supernova. The first thought they'd likely have is that it's a Federation plot to destabilise the empire, which isn't unreasonable. We don't know what's been happening since the events of Nemesis, though there were indications that relations ...   \n",
       "1021  So I was a defender of this show earlier on. I saw some flaws with it but I also saw it’s potential. As time has gone on I feel like that it’s been slipping more and more into being a disappointment. Now I know that there will be those who disagree with me and I welcome their thoughts. If anyone has opinions that makes more sense of things then awesome. I know some of these posts get a little heated so I just wanted to try to welcome open and civil dialogue up front. Anyways here are some of my criticisms on episode 9. I’m having trouble with this new Soong. The entire reasoning for Nooniens devotion to the creation of Data and his brothers was to combine his passion for developing synthetic life and his need for having children. He even referred to Data as his son. It was even established that he was unable to have children with Datas mother Juliana. So the only way that this could make sense is if Noonien had a son with a woman before Juliana and they had a falling out. That he ...   \n",

She's a really deep actress. That conversation with her was extremely compelling. She puts a lot of thought and passion into her acting!       I love Wil and how passionate and open he is about being a huge nerd, love you Wil! But damn that was a good interview. I usually feel like younger actors just kind of wing things and focus on themselves, but Isa was totally into it. And her acting as Sutra was really intense.      I like seeing people seriously passionate about their careers. She went way beyond just \"I'm making it up as I go along\" and really put serious thought into it, to the point she could have a fun and energetic conversation with Wil about her acting. And we know he takes his roles really serious and totally nerds out on them. Major props?   \n",

My first contact with the Star Trek universe were the new movies and, despite liking them, I always knew that there was much more to explore in the story.I’ve always wanted to watch the whole thing, but life can get in the way some times. So, I turned to my father’s collection of VHS tapes. He is a Star Trek fan. I’ve watched a lot of stuff with him, but I have to admit I love TNG. I’m not nearly close to finishing, I’ve only watched a couple of episodes but I could not be happier in finally devoting time to this series.Although, while watching the first season I’ve been thinking about how much I might be missing by not starting with the original series. There were a couple of references and the appearance of DeForest Kelley already, and sure I can pick up on something, but it’s not the same.The problem isn’t that I don’t like TOS, quite the contrary, it’s just that I like watching TNG t...   \n",

However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable.

You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?   \n",
       "1  It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to wa...   \n",
       "2  I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. • It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. • You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. You are also ...   \n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",

You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?</td>\n",

However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\".

When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. • You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example.

You'd think people would be fine with that, but instead there are about 50 comments of people claiming that Kathleen Kennedy \"forced\" Dave Filoni to gender swap the characters to \"promote her political agenda.\" Seriously, y'all need to chill- I mean, yeah those episodes suck, but does everything have to be about gender?   \n",
       "1  It sounds like there are some exciting things happening in The Clone Wars currently, and I have to admit I feel like I'm missing out not watching it. I watched the first few seasons a few years back, but the show ultimately lost me due to some decisions they made I just couldn't get behind - mainly, bringing Darth Maul back (I really thought that was stupid, and diminished Obi-Wan's arc in TPM - killing Maul was his coming of age, and he became a Jedi Knight as the first person to kill a Sith Lord in 1000 years). However, I really like how the show develops Anakin better and portrays his relationship with Obi-Wan, which makes the mentions of Luke's father in the OT much more believable. Unfortunately, the EU has always had both really awesome and also really dumb things happen, so I just choose to ignore the stories I think are ridiculous and accept the good stuff into my own \"canon\". My question is: how big of a part does Darth Maul play in the show overall? Would I be able to wa...   \n",
       "2  I have an idea for a Star Wars game. It’s like GTA meets elite dangerous and a couple of other games. It would be a game where you play as a bounty hunter. • It would have RPG elements with a class system. You could be for example a Trandoshan and would have an emphasis on stealth or a Mandalorian and go in guns blazing etc.• You can do missions for different syndicates like the Pykes, Hutts and others. Certain crime syndicates have mission types exclusive to them  like the pykes having spice running missions. When you do missions for a certain syndicate for a while your respect with them will go up and you will be able to get better rewards for missions from them. • You can upgrade and buy new gear, weapons ammunition and ships. classes will have special specific gear for them, the Mandalorian class will have vambraces for example. Your ship’s hyperdrive, engines, shields, weapons and more can be upgraded. You can also get a variety of ground vehicles like speeders. You are also ...   \n",

So my dad who saw the orginal in the theater and he says it \"I am your father\" but me being born years later and seeing the movies through out my life, and what I have hear is \"luke, i am your father\". And after we got into a large argument, I decided to take it to reddit and now I am for sure people will get on my back for this but me and my sisters have different answers, and I think I should forget about it and belive my dad but I would like to hear all of your answers.   \n",
